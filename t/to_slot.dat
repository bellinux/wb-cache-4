5|$|On 10 December, {{the first}} match after United's {{elimination}} from the UEFA Champions League, Nani scored a brace {{in a home}} match against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He opened the scoring in the 17th minute to put them 1–0 up with a shot into the bottom left corner. He scored his second goal in the 56th minute, tapping in from Antonio Valencia's drilled cross across the six-yard box to extend the lead to 3–1. He was later replaced by winger Ashley Young as the match finished 4–1 to the home side. Nani scored his sixth league goal {{of the season and}} provided two assists in a 5–0 away win at Fulham on 21 December. He first advanced on a run down the left flank before crossing for Danny Welbeck <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> home. He then met a Ryan Giggs cross with his head to glance United into a 2–0 lead. He then returned the compliment, squaring for Giggs to put United 3–0 up before half-time.|$|E
5|$|The day's battle {{began on}} 18 June 1815 at about 11a.m. with a French attack on Hougoumont from the south-west, led by Napoleon's brother Jerome. The French {{gained control of}} much of the chateau's park, but the Allies {{retained}} possession of the farmhouse and courtyard surrounds. Jerome continued his attempts to take the farmhouse throughout the day, making four or five assaults, most of which were repulsed by the defenders, who fired through loopholes, windows, and doorways. One assault at about 12.30p.m. breached the north gate, which had been left open to allow allied troop and supply movements. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, of the French 1st Light Infantry, broke through the wooden doors with an axe, allowing French soldiers to flood the courtyard. Graham's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, led his men through the melee in the courtyard to the gates, in an attempt to shut them against the pressing French. This was done with the help of three officers (Captain Wyndham, Ensign Hervey, and Ensign Gooch), Corporal Graham, and a few other soldiers including Graham's brother Joseph. James Graham was the one <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> the bar in place. Flagstones, carts, and debris were then piled against the gates to hold them secure. The Frenchmen trapped within the courtyard were all killed, apart from a young drummer-boy.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal made a host {{of changes}} before the match {{restarted}} – Gilberto, Robin van Persie and Alexander Hleb were substituted on for Bergkamp, Robert Pirès and Flamini. Robben made a run down {{the right side of}} the pitch, but failed to get past Senderos in what was the first notable action of the second half. Moments after, Fredrik Ljungberg's attempt on goal was cleared by the Chelsea defence following good play by Van Persie. In the 57th minute Chelsea increased their lead. A long pass found Drogba, who once more held off Senderos in pursuit of the ball. He was forced wide by Lehmann, but on the turn shot the ball through the net to score his second goal of the game. Drogba was then replaced by Hernán Crespo, and Tiago came on for Eiður Guðjohnsen. Arsenal scored in the 64th minute; Ljungberg crossed the ball from the left and Fàbregas evaded the Chelsea defence <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> it past Čech in the goal. Both clubs made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Wright-Phillips coming on for his Chelsea debut in place of Robben. Arsenal continued to push for an equaliser the longer the match went on, which meant they were culpable to Chelsea countering. A free-kick by Van Persie was saved by Čech and it was not until the 86th minute that Henry fashioned his first chance of the half – it too was dealt with by Čech. Chelsea continued to withstand Arsenal’s pressure in injury time and came close to scoring a third goal, but for Touré’s intervention.|$|E

We then consider probabilistic assignment of agents <b>to</b> <b>slots,</b> and make use of the previous method to propose an aggregate gap minimizing modification of the classic random priority method to solve this class of problems. We also provide some logical relations in our setting among standard axioms in the literature on assignment problems, and explore the robustness of our results to several extensions of our setting...|$|R

25|$|On Friday 26 January Sydney {{played their}} first leg home final against the Queensland Roar {{in front of}} a crowd of 23,450 at the Sydney Football Stadium. The match which was {{supposed}} to be played up at Queensland's home ground Suncorp Stadium but it was moved to Sydney because of a concert by the '80s band The Police. Recent matches against the roar, had all been mostly uneventful affairs, including a 0–0 draw a couple of weeks beforehand, and it was the same again. Both sides had few chances during the 1st half, but Queensland's Brazilian import Reinaldo missed a golden opportunity when he air-swinged a cross in the opening 10minutes. Sydney's best chance came in the 2nd half when Alex Brosque made a break, got around defender Andrew Packer and only had <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> the ball past the keeper but ended up booting the ball over the crossbar, and into the disappointed 'cove' supporters.|$|E
25|$|After an {{international}} break which saw Sebastian Giovinco further cement {{his place in}} Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's plans for Euro 2012 the following summer, Parma travelled to Champions League side Napoli, who had beaten giants Internazionale in their previous game by three goals to nil. Napoli had much of {{the ball in the}} early stages, but failed {{to make the most of}} their control of the ball, while Parma looked dangerous on the counter. This pattern continued into the second half before a Massimo Gobbi goal give Parma an unexpected lead just before an hour had passed. The left-back surged forward through Napoli's pedestrian midfield and laid the ball off to Sergio Floccari, who flicked the ball back into Gobbi's path, allowing Gobbi <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> home from point blank range. Napoli continued to press and eventually found an equaliser in a similar fashion to Parma's opener, Ezequiel Lavezzi supplying the backheel flick and playing the one-two with substitute Giuseppe Mascara. The sides were level for five minutes before Parma once again proved to have the more clinical instinct in front of goal. Francesco Valiani worked the ball out wide to Giovinco, who found Francesco Modesto sliding in at the back post to give Parma a 2–1 in the 82nd minute to momentarily put Parma seventh.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the final}} two-week {{international}} break, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 30 March to face Chelsea {{for the third}} time in the season, ahead of the visitors' FA Cup replay just two days later. Despite a number of key injuries, including captain Adam Lallana and playmaker Gastón Ramírez, Southampton started the game at a high tempo, with Jay Rodriguez coming close early on after a long run through the Chelsea defence. Rodriguez eventually did open the scoring for the hosts in the 23rd minute, linking up well with Steven Davis <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> calmly past Petr Čech to put the Saints ahead. Ten minutes later John Terry equalised with a header from a corner, although the hope for the visiting side did not last long as a Rickie Lambert free kick on his 500th career league appearance just two minutes later put the home side back in the lead going into half time. Goalkeeper Artur Boruc was taken off at the break and replaced by Kelvin Davis, who later made a number of key saves to deny Chelsea from coming back into the match. Despite high pressure from the visitors towards the end of the game, Southampton held on and moved up to 12th in the table following Everton's win later in the day.|$|E

Stevenage {{turned it around}} in the second half, with goals from Michael Bostwick and Charlie Griffin. Stevenage followed this up with another away win four days later at Crawley Town; winning the match 30. Stevenage started brightly and scored within the first five minutes; Yemi Odubade latching onto David Bridges through ball <b>to</b> <b>slot</b> home. The visitors doubled their lead on the half hour mark, this time Tim Sills was the provider, as Odubade scored his second. Joel Byrom scored Stevenage's third in the second half, picking up the ball a yard inside the Crawley half and chipped Simon Rayner in goal. Stevenage then followed this up with an eighth consecutive victory, beating Oxford United 10 at Broadhall Way. The only goal of the game came seven minutes into the second half, David Bridges was fouled in the area by Chris Hargreaves; Scott Laird stepped up and subsequently scored to ensure the home side earned three points. Four days later, Stevenage lost 10 to Luton Town thanks to a Matthew Barnes-Homer goal in the second half. Stevenage bounced back just two days later on Easter Monday, with a 30 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow. The away side {{took the lead in}} the ninth minute; Mark Roberts bundling home a Joel Byrom corner after Tim Sills had knocked the ball down. Just two minutes later, Stevenage doubled their lead, again Byrom was the provider, and his lofted ball was met on the half-volley by Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball home - making his first start since breaking his leg in August. Stevenage rounded off the victory in injury-time, substitute Eddie Odhiambo slotting the ball home from Charlie Griffin's cross. Stevenage then faced Forest Green Rovers at Broadhall Way five days later; the game ended 20 to Stevenage. The home side took the lead in the tenth minute; Tim Sills broke the offside trap and set up Joel Byrom to lash the ball home. Stevenage doubled their lead in the second half when substitute David Bridges was brought down in the area. Scott Laird calmly stepped up and stroked the ball into the net. A third win followed four days later, when Stevenage beat Altrincham 10 in a tight encounter at Moss Lane. Substitute Charlie Griffin scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute; Altrincham goalkeeper Russell Saunders fumbled the ball into the path of Griffin who placed his shot in-between the goalkeeper and the post to ensure a valuable three points to the visitors.|$|E
