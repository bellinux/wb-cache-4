5|$|Ryan White {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of the disease. Ryan, along with actor Rock Hudson, was one of the {{earliest}} public faces of AIDS. Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV/AIDS, such as the Ray brothers, Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe, The Brady Bunch's Robert Reed, Tim Richmond, Elizabeth Glaser, Liberace, Freddie Mercury and Charlie Sheen, Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.|$|E

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered a high quality and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much more cautious when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} widely held that nominal {{disturbances}} influence real economic activity by distorting <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>perception</b> of relative prices. Implicit in this hypothesis {{is the assumption that}} there is a lag in <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> aggregate price level. This paper tests this assumption using the Michigan Survey data on inflation expectations. The econometric results refute the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> is ignorant of the current price level and fail to refute the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> is fully aware of the current consumer price index. There is no evidence of a perception lag in these data. Households; Inflation; Price Level; Prices...|$|R

The FEC said that because it is important to protect the integrity of the Government, as well as to uphold <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>perception</b> of integrity, <b>the</b> limitation was necessary and still complied with the First Amendment. The FEC believed private financing could tarnish the protection of integrity and <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>perception.</b> <b>The</b> Commission also believed the FECA would not hinder individual expression, and that ample room was left to freely express oneself under the Act.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>the</b> <b>public???s</b> logo <b>perceptions</b> after seeing or not seeing a logo affect their loyalty {{in terms of}} brand familiarity, perceived quality, trustworthiness, attractiveness/likeableness, and likelihood to recommend the product. This study focuses on smartphone brand logos representing individual corporations. In this study, there were 185 people participating in four surveys. The results showed that a logo, as a corporate identity symbol, can reflect <b>the</b> <b>public???s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of its brand. It can aid in building loyal customer relationships through perceptions of product quality and service. Among competitive brands, logos play important roles in influencing <b>the</b> <b>public???s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of trustworthiness, which is positively related to brand familiarity and perceived quality of products and service. The results further indicate that logos can affect <b>the</b> <b>public???s</b> attitudes, but might not change their behaviors. The study also implies that trustworthiness {{may be influenced by}} logo design...|$|R
40|$|I {{analyzed}} how media’s {{discussion of}} a legal case altered <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of <b>the</b> U. S. legal system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to see if the media’s coverage of legal cases influences how <b>the</b> <b>public</b> views <b>the</b> legal system. It was hypothesized that the format media presents a legal case in alters how people view the legal system and that it most often leads to a negative perception. In this research, a documentary about a case, 30 online news articles discussing the case, and 197 <b>public</b> reactions to <b>the</b> case and the legal system were analyzed. I use the Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey cases from the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer to examine the legal implications of the media. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> followed <b>the</b> same patterns as online news media, and the biggest category discussed was a generalization of the legal system. It was also found that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> applied their negative opinion of the case to the legal system. Through referencing the validity of the legal system, <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> shows a statement that the legal system is not a fully legitimate order...|$|R

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of naturism tends to increase {{during the summer}} months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist. Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists. This quiddity has caught <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.|$|E

This research sought to address three questions. First, are people only able to relate to environmental issues if they are concrete, immediate and local? Second, do people consider environmental problems to be more serious at a global or a local level? Third, what is the effect of <b>the</b> <b>public’s</b> <b>perceptions</b> of <b>the</b> seriousness of environmental problems on their sense of responsibility for taking action...|$|R

25|$|The {{influence}} of British newspapers on creating <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of mods {{as having a}} leisure-filled club-going lifestyle {{can be seen in}} a 1964 article in the Sunday Times. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod who went out clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had the time and money to spend this much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argue that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.|$|E
