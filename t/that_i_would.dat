5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> accept them both.|$|E
5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E

5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E
25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have expected from him.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E
25|$|His first {{experience}} with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center {{when he was in}} high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran. He completed the task after a couple of weeks ("I swore <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages") and {{spent the rest of the}} summer writing a text editor in APL and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming language on the IBM System/360.|$|E
25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have described if I could through a review.|$|E

25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never {{have become a}} writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

[...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that and the way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving {{on a personal level}} and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E

500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather die in America than live in England. ... I added <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
