5|$|Another epic film, On My Honor, was {{conceived}} and begun by Cecil B. DeMille. It was {{to document the}} founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, the first place <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> issue with his race. As the team arrived {{in the early morning}} of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go behind the plate.|$|E
5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow. and R.E.M.. The band draw their musical style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in the Back and Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E

25|$|The race among Europeans {{to obtain}} live coffee trees or beans was {{eventually}} {{won by the}} Dutch in 1616.

25|$|Jesper took an {{interest}} in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran Pietist movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with God rather than relying on sheer faith (sola fide). Sola fide is a tenet of the Lutheran Church, and Jesper was charged with being a pietist heretic. While controversial, the beliefs were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that angels and spirits were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans next moved against Austria in 1682 in {{retaliation}} against Habsburg raids, reaching Vienna in 1683, which proved well fortified, {{and set about}} besieging it. The allied forces eventually proved superior and {{the lifting of the}} siege was followed by a series of victories in 1687, 1687 and 1697, resulting in the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), Belgrade having fallen in 1688 (but recaptured in 1690). This provided Austrian hegemony over Austria and introduced a large number of Serbs into the Empire, who were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on policies over the ensuing centuries.|$|E

Growth will be well below the 8–10% levels that are widely regarded as necessary <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on poverty and unemployment.

25|$|Child {{trafficking}} {{has also}} been shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking. Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short. As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life. In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, McDonald's {{pledged to}} stop using eggs from battery cage {{facilities}} by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on the egg industry and {{is part of a}} general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.|$|E
25|$|D. sylvestris is also {{affected}} by parasites {{that influence the}} individual. These include both fungi and roundworms. In particular, the fungus Paecilomyces farinosus and the mermithid roundworm, Pheromermis pachysoma are known to parasitize the tree wasp. P. farinosus most often infects wasps and nests after death and therefore does not majorly influence {{the health of the}} colony. P. pachysoma typically infects flies and other insects when the roundworm eggs are eaten. The parasites then hatch in the insects and infects the wasp when the infected insects are fed to the wasp larvae. These roundworms usually do not kill the infected wasp but grow in their abdomen and can cause sexuals to become sterile. This has a negative impact on the individual as they are not able to reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation. However, this is not likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on the colony since most worker eggs are policed and the queens typically only have a single mate.|$|E
