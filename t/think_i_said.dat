25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the same passage, Suzanne Fields goes on to note [...] "When asked if the stories were true, Mr. Cockburn delicately demurs. 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> they were true,' he told The New Republic. 'I don't know there's enough {{exterior}} evidence {{to determine whether they}} are true or not.'" [...] Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories. Rather, by noting that all of these Jewish conspiracy stories are [...] "sloshing around the news," [...] Cockburn seems merely to be pointing out that, hey, anti-Semitic ideas are still out there today — so why the shock that [...] endorsed them 30 years ago? Indeed, when I reached Cockburn to ask him about these conspiracies, he insisted he was just reporting what was already in circulation.|$|E
2500|$|In the US Grierson had met {{pioneering}} documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for {{his contributions}} to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events. [...] Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. ("In the profounder kind of way", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, [...] "we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film {{should be on the}} everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: [...] "Beware {{the ends of the earth}} and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums; are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty." [...] "'You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we are going after the savages of Birmingham,' I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to him pretty early on. And we did.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Art Rooney, {{owner of}} the Pittsburgh Steelers, chose Byron [...] "Whizzer" [...] White {{in the first round}} of the 1938 draft despite White's known public {{declaration}} that he would not play professional football and would instead begin work on his Rhodes scholarship. White did, however, agree to play for the 1938 season after Rooney publicly gave him a guaranteed contract of $15,000, double what any other player had ever made in the NFL. The size of the dollar amount brought condemnation from other owners because it altered the pay expectations of college draftees. For the 1939 draft Wellington, for the first time, was put in charge of drafting players for the Giants. He submitted the list of players into the pool that the Giants—or other franchises—could choose players from. However, in the first round he selected a player, Walt Nielsen, not on the list of players that the Giants or any other franchise had submitted. With a grin Wellington stated, [...] "'I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I put every name on that list.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into my head that he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that – Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|E
