5|$|With {{the basic}} concept proven, the team <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> for a {{suitable}} aircraft {{to carry the}} receiver. Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, a reversal of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal electrical noise.|$|E
5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E
5|$|Game {{development}} costs gradually increased, and Nintendo {{did not provide}} Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. According to Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper, they were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. Rare was interested in Activision's offer, but the deal collapsed and on 24 September 2002 Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log cabin was a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

His appointment was controversial as he did not possess the coaching qualifications required to manage a Premier League football club. However, at a Premier League meeting on 22 November 2006, Southgate was granted a dispensation to continue in his role {{until the end of the}} season, during which time it was announced that he will study for the Uefa Pro A Licence.|$|E
25|$|Marshall first {{examined}} the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{and determined that}} the Act purported to give the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over writs of mandamus. Marshall <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> to Article III of the Constitution, which defines the Supreme Court's original and appellate jurisdictions (see Relevant Law above). Marbury had argued that the Constitution was only intended to set a floor for original jurisdiction that Congress could add to. Marshall disagreed and held that Congress {{does not have the}} power to modify the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Consequently, Marshall found that the Constitution and the Judiciary Act conflict.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{design of the}} Altair, the parts {{needed to make a}} {{complete}} machine would not fit on a single motherboard, and the machine consisted of four boards stacked {{on top of each other}} with stand-offs. Another problem facing Roberts was that the parts needed to make a truly useful computer weren't available, or wouldn't be designed in time for the January launch date. So during the construction of the second model, he decided to build most of the machine on removable cards, reducing the motherboard to nothing more than an interconnect between the cards, a backplane. The basic machine consisted of five cards, including the CPU on one and memory on another. He <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> for a cheap source of connectors, and came across a supply of 100-pin edge connectors. The S-100 bus was eventually acknowledged by the professional computer community and adopted as the IEEE-696 computer bus standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller {{came to the}} crease {{on the first day}} with the score at 3/128 after Australia won the toss and elected to bat, facing wet {{conditions}} after the loss of Arthur Morris and Harvey in quick succession. He scored 55 in a partnership of 109 for the fourth wicket with Hassett. Both players batted patiently, scoring at around two runs per over. Miller was then dismissed by Johnny Wardle while going for a big hit to leave the score at 4/237 early on the second morning. It was a subdued innings from the all-rounder, who had hit only three fours in 184 balls faced. His dismissal triggered a sharp collapse as all the incoming batsmen were unable to pass four and Australia lost a total of 7/12 (including 6/5) to be all out for 249. Miller <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> on as England were bowled out for 144. He scored five in the second innings, caught off a deliberate full toss by Bedser, as Australia collapsed and lost 7/59 to be dismissed for 123, leaving England a victory target of 229. The hosts reached 1/120 before the match ended in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after he had seen a job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E
