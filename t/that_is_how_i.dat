[...] McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, [...] "Animation is an art. [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> conceived it. [...] But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. [...] Not an art, but a trade. [...] Bad Luck!"

Producer Quincy Jones {{had wanted to}} include a rock and roll song in the vein of the Knack's [...] "My Sharona", though Jackson reportedly had never previously shown {{an interest in the}} genre. Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "I wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song... <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> approached it and I wanted the children to really enjoy it—the school children as well as the college students." [...] Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of [...] "Beat It" [...] and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary, Indiana.

500|$|The team {{rested on}} December 29—the day {{following}} their final regular-season game. They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because we have that luxury. But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I will be watching the guys I am going against... <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> watch it." ...|$|E

60|$|To set {{me against}} her sister, {{in her own}} private interests--there, as I felt sure, was the motive under which she was acting.

2500|$|He {{had a great}} {{interest}} in horse racing... Father studied the race horse in its trotting and pace, noting the great burst of power over the last 120 yards (100 m) or so. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> heard father rode his races, like a racehorse never swaying or losing rhythm and balance, with a strong final surge. The French horse has always been noted for its speed, English horses for stamina. That is why English horses seldom win on the shorter French courses. It is so with the cyclists also, isn't it? ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: [...] "I left EastEnders because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break. I wanted {{to do other things}} and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. But throughout everything that has happened in my life I have had tremendous support from the people in EastEnders. I love them so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line when I left the show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel. It is nice that they have left the door open for Kathy to return." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The issue {{revolved}} around Queen refusing {{to go on}} at their allotted time because the light wasn't right - I remember it was sundown, so whoever went on stage wouldn't get the full benefit of their light show. It came down to a battle between management, which then spilled into a fracas between the roadies of our respective bands, as each crew jostled to set gear up. The MC (or some other promoter) goaded the crowd into an us and them vibe, with the local band in favour over the unknown [...] "pommie bastards". It ended with us going on stage first, and Queen redeeming themselves to the crowd and showing a hint {{of what they were}} to become. And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> remember it".- Kerry McKenna, bass guitarist for Madder Lake.|$|E
6000|$|... "About the colours? No one.

But it showed that Islam is a peace-loving and forgiving religion, and I hope that this is his legacy in Tajikistan." [...] Dodajon Ataullo, editor-in-chief of Charoghi Ruz newspaper, [...] "His death is very heavy on me, very painful for me. During his illness, I was always with him [...] I remember his face, his features, his soulful eyes. I recognize him not only as one of the biggest politicians, but [...] as one of the major personalities and most beloved figures in Tajikistan's history in the 20th century. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> view him." [...] Mahmadsaid Ubaidulloyev, Chairman of the Tajik Parliament, said, [...] "His personal qualities and political charisma raised his authority among the citizens of Tajikistan {{and the members of the}} Islamic Renaissance Party. The president of the republic highly values [...] role, his activities, and appreciates and calls attention to his deeds. Today we say goodbye to a famous politician, and we respect his role in establishing peace and unity in Tajikistan. We remember his great and historic part and his spiritual deeds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Patriots and Giants {{had played}} {{against each other}} in the last week of the regular season. [...] Technically, the game had little significance, since both teams had already {{clinched}} their respective spots in the playoffs. [...] But due to the Patriots' quest for an undefeated season, this game {{was one of the most}} heavily watched games in league history. NFL Network was originally scheduled to air the game as part of their Saturday Night Football coverage, with WCVB and WWOR carrying the game locally in Boston and New York. Shortly before the game was scheduled to air CBS and NBC bought broadcast rights to the game and NFL Network's broadcast was carried by both networks, marking the first time in NFL history that an NFL game was carried on three broadcast networks at the same time. [...] The game was also the first NFL game to be simulcast on a national level since Super Bowl I. [...] As they were favored to do, the Patriots won the game to finish the regular season undefeated. Still, the game was close and competitive, with both teams playing their starters for all 60 minutes. New England won, 38–35, by overcoming a 12-point deficit in the third quarter, the largest deficit the Patriots had faced all season. [...] "There is nothing but positives", Giants coach Tom Coughlin said after the game. [...] "I told the players in playing this game everything would be positives, there would be no negatives and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel. I don't know any better way to be prepared for the playoffs than to go against a team that was 15–0." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E

It doesn't matter now what we wanted so much money at one time for, but that Scot and I did {{occasionally}} want it. The Scot sent me out one day to get it.
