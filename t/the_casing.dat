5|$|The smokebox was an {{integral}} part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox that acted as a former to maintain the shape of <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b> In between, <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E

5|$|Docks {{for both}} the iPhone 5S and 5C {{were found on the}} Apple online store after the announcement. Because of <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> {{difference}} between the iPhone 5S and 5C, they have separate docks, each made specifically for each respective phone.|$|E
5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing {{and soft}} steam exhaust from the multiple-jet blastpipe. The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, and smoke continued to beat down onto <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> while moving, obscuring the driver's vision. There was much experimentation in order to resolve this problem, {{with varying degrees of}} success, and photographic evidence shows the many guises of this project.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>casing</b> {{was tested}} in a wind tunnel, and {{retained}} after it {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its aerodynamic form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver's vision with smoke.|$|E

5000|$|One {{apparent}} projectile {{was found}} near the body. There were ten spent [...]40-caliber <b>casings</b> scattered on <b>the</b> {{south side of}} the road near Brown's body. The distribution of <b>the</b> <b>casings,</b> combined with most of <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing. Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} {{all types}} of casing’s sizes applied in a well, one needs to start from <b>the</b> smallest <b>casing</b> string to be run in a hole. Once <b>the</b> smallest <b>casing</b> is fixed, other series of casing size and hole sizes can be determined. <b>The</b> smallest <b>casing</b> size is selected based on well testing and logging tools and production tools to be run in the well. In our case, <b>the</b> production <b>casing,</b> which is <b>the</b> smallest <b>casing,</b> is 5 1 / 2 in. Figure  6 shows a typical tubing and bit selection chart. The bit sizes and other casing sizes can be selected according to this chart. After selecting <b>the</b> smaller <b>casing</b> sizes, proper bit and a larger <b>casing</b> string for <b>the</b> following run can be selected.|$|R
5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in <b>the</b> <b>casing,</b> which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. <b>The</b> <b>casing</b> weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

40|$|Several geometrically {{different}} porous casings {{were tested}} with an axial-flow compressor rotor {{to determine their}} effects upon the rotor stall-limit line and overall performance. The tests were conducted using both uniform and nonuniform inlet-flow conditions. The rotor performance with <b>the</b> various <b>casing</b> treatments is compared with that obtained with a solid <b>casing.</b> <b>The</b> ability of <b>the</b> various <b>casing</b> treatments to displace the rotor stall-limit line to lower weight flows was observed. Significant stall-margin increases were obtained with several of <b>the</b> porous <b>casings.</b> Peak efficiencies with two of <b>the</b> porous <b>casings</b> were as high as or slightly higher than that obtained with solid casing...|$|R
5000|$|Chireta {{literally}} means [...] "inside out"—i.e., the sheep's intestines {{which make}} up <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> are cleaned and turned inside out for a smoother, more appetizing appearance.|$|R
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b> Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September, a 100-year-old {{statue of}} Mary at the St. Mary's Church in Kolar was damaged by vandals, St. George Church in Ernody was desecrated and {{attempted}} to be burned by vandals, and over 20 vandals desecrated the Rima Worship Centre at Adyar. On 18 September, vandals shattered the glass encasing of the Mother Mary statue of the Presentation Girls School in Dharwad and on 19 September, a gang of vandals on motorbikes pelted stones at the St. Xavier's Church in Padu Kody in Mangalore taluk and destroyed the idols. On 21 September, a further four attacks were reported, including Brethren Christa Aaradhanalaya prayer hall near Nellihudikeri in Kodagu district, the Believers' Church in Yedapadavu, Mangalore taluk, and two churches in Bangalore; St. James Church in Mariyannapalya near Hebbal and Lumbini Gardens, which had two gold plated crowns and cash from the offering box stolen and the main sacrament vandalised; and the Holy Church in the Name of Jesus at Rajarajeshwarinagar had <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> around the Infant Jesus smashed and the statue damaged. In Banaswadi, a group {{were reported to have}} pelted stones at a church and fled. A Catholic school was also attacked in Kasaragod district in Kerala.|$|E
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{variations}} for <b>the</b> <b>casings.</b> <b>The</b> classic series offers slow growth hard wood surfaces in ebony, pernumbuco and grenadilla. The Intuition series offers glossy black resin, the Guilloche series offer craved dyed resin in coral, indigo, sahara, and black {{as well as several}} woods.|$|R
30|$|The pipes are steel, {{which has}} a high thermal conductivity, so in the model the thermal {{resistance}} of <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> has been neglected compared to the rock resistance.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, a well {{contains}} multiple {{intervals of}} casing successively placed within <b>the</b> previous <b>casing</b> run. <b>The</b> following <b>casing</b> intervals are typically {{used in an}} oil or gas well: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> is maintained {{slightly higher than}} atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b> Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Casing flow: {{means that}} the {{producing}} fluid flow has only one path to the surface through <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The case is {{the outer}} shell of the combustor, and is a fairly simple structure. <b>The</b> <b>casing</b> {{generally}} requires little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern. However, <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand {{the difference between the}} high pressures inside the combustor and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.|$|E
30|$|The {{emulsion}} {{was filled}} into the Sirman sausage filler (Model- 1 S-V 15 -IRDA-VERT, S.No. 07  L 01410. Marsango, Italy) and <b>the</b> artificial cellulose <b>casing</b> was applied on the nozzle of sausage filler.

5000|$|The defendant, a {{part-time}} scrap metal dealer, entered {{an air force}} bombing range, from which he collected spent bomb casings. These casings had been lying around for years. The defendant sold <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> at a junk market, earning a profit of $84. For this, the defendant was charged with violating [...] which made {{it a crime to}} [...] "knowingly convert" [...] government property. The defendant conceded he had done the act. His sole defense was that he believed that <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> were abandoned property, and therefore there was no crime in taking them.|$|R

25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS light are <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> {{in which the}} internal parts are mounted, an ellipsoidal reflector located {{in the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>casing,</b> a lamp mounted to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. The light from the lamp is efficiently gathered by the ellipsoidal reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|E
25|$|Casing and tubing flow: {{means that}} there is tubing within <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> that allows fluid to reach the surface. This tubing {{can be used as a}} kill string for {{chemical}} injection. The tubing may have a “no-go” nipple at the end as a means of pressure testing.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside <b>the</b> <b>casing</b> when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of <b>the</b> <b>casing,</b> completely sealing off any explosive gases in <b>the</b> <b>casing.</b> This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|The CIB hired renowned {{forensic}} scientist Henry Lee ({{forensic scientist}}) {{to examine the}} physical evidence. Dr. Henry Lee was famous for defending O.J. Simpson {{in the murder of}} his wife and lover, and helped acquit Simpson based on the LAPD's lack of professionalism and possibility of planted evidence at the murder site. Dr. Henry Lee and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had cleaned up the firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until <b>the</b> <b>casings</b> were found.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantages of}} compound turbines are {{the reduction in}} size of any one <b>casing,</b> <b>the</b> confinement of the highest pressure to <b>the</b> smaller <b>casing</b> (which may be made of stronger and more expensive materials) {{and the possibility of}} divided flow in <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>casing</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of equalizing end thrusts.|$|R
40|$|Turbine inlet {{temperature}} is reaching values far above acceptable material temperatures. Thus the thermally highly loaded components {{have to be}} cooled intensively. One of the most thermally loaded components is <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing.</b> In recent years research on heat transfer at <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing</b> received a big boost by availability of faster and more accurate measurement techniques. So far the investigations are limited to design condition, no information is available at offdesign conditions. This paper aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the major phenomena governing heat transfer in <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing</b> region, including <b>the</b> influence of different operating conditions. Using an HP-turbine at different flow conditions, extended measurements were performed at DLR’s wind tunnel for Rotating Cascades (RGG), Göttingen, including the flow field in the tip gap and close to <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing.</b> <b>The</b> Nusselt correlation for a flat plate was investigated for it’s applicability to <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing.</b> <b>The</b> influence of the incidence angle on the heat transfer levels at the upstream part of <b>the</b> over-tip <b>casing</b> is investigated. Also the influence of the rotational speed on tip-leakage flow and casing heat transfer will be discussed. These results are compared to flat plate heat transfer correlations for design and off-design conditions...|$|R
