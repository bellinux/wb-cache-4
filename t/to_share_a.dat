The two are about <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, and she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but {{the driver of the}} ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of power with him.|$|E

During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E

5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E

She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina {{represented}} an existential threat. It also signified a threat to Brazilian hegemony across its southern borders. A successful Argentine bid to incorporate Paraguay and Uruguay into a reconstituted Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (and control of the Platine river network consequently passing into entirely hostile hands) would have threatened to cut communication between the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro. With river transportation denied, the alternative land routes would require months of travel instead of days. Nor was Brazil keen <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> direct border with Argentina, fearing an increased vulnerability to an invasion by Rosas.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an {{affluent}} part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, {{as well as}} gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with {{a wide spectrum of}} literature.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Latiolais {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} a cladogram (tree of descent) {{that attempts to}} show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus (including Strombus canarium) and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny Strombus canarium, Strombus vittatus (a synonym for Doxander vittatus) and Strombus epidromis (Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely related, and appear <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, DNA {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage {{was found to be}} the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.|$|E

The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} NHL season, Linden {{finished}} {{second on the}} team in goals, with 21, and points, 51, and finished third in assists with 30. The following year, {{he was one of}} three Canucks <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> rotating captaincy (the others being Doug Lidster and Dan Quinn). Linden led the team with 37 assists and 70 points, and made his first appearance in an NHL All-Star Game, where he was the youngest player. At the age of 21, he was made sole captain of the team, becoming the youngest Canucks captain. That season, Linden led the Canucks in scoring for a second straight year with 75 points (31 goals and 44 assists), leading the Canucks to their first division title since the 1974–75 season.|$|E

The two routes continued <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY234 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY234 became an extension of NY31.|$|E

The gameplay uses a similar action-based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free-to-play model in common with mobile titles. The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world {{in the midst of}} a battle and are forced <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>a</b> body in order to survive.|$|E
