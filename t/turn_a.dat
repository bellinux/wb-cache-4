5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand <b>turn.</b> <b>A</b> worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E

5|$|After van der Linden's {{death in}} 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow {{a total of}} 1,000gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, {{borrowed}} from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted {{most of his time}} to the publishing house, and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. The publishing house was, however, unable to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> profit. That year he published a new syair, consisting of 24quartets, entitled Orang Prampoewan. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including Bintang Betawi and Domingoe.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In <b>turn,</b> <b>a</b> beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E

50|$|This {{process is}} {{mediated}} by the weak interaction. The neutron <b>turns</b> into <b>a</b> proton through the emission of a virtual W− boson. At the quark level, W− emission <b>turns</b> <b>a</b> down quark into <b>an</b> up quark, <b>turning</b> <b>a</b> neutron (one up quark and two down quarks) into a proton (two up quarks and one down quark).The virtual W− boson then decays into an electron and an antineutrino.|$|R
5|$|Chelsea did not <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> {{profit in}} the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005. In November 2012, Chelsea {{announced}} a profit of £1.4million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership. This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4million for the year to June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> profit.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single <b>turn,</b> <b>a</b> team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson was {{a member}} of the Crovan dynasty, a family of sea-kings who ruled the Mann and parts of the Hebrides from the late {{eleventh}} century to the mid thirteenth century. He was the son of Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, King of the Isles (died 1231), who was in <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> son of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1229). Although the latter monarch may have managed to rule a somewhat independent kingdom, surrounded by formidable Norwegian, Scottish, and English monarchs, his successors fell under the shadow of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), and rendered tribute to the latter in recognition of Norwegian overlordship.|$|E

The second race had a record-breaking total of 22 lead changes in the Gatorade Duels among seven different drivers and had five caution periods.

5|$|Majungasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the theropod clade Abelisauridae, which is considered a family in Linnaean taxonomy. Along with the family Noasauridae, abelisaurids are included in the superfamily Abelisauroidea, which is in <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> subdivision of the infraorder Ceratosauria. Abelisaurids are known for their tall skulls with blunt snouts, extensive sculpturing on the outer surfaces of the facial bones (convergent with carcharodontosaurids), very reduced (atrophied) forelimbs (convergent with tyrannosaurids), and stocky hindlimb proportions, among other features.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> profit.|$|E
