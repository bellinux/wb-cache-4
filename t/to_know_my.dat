5|$|I can't complain...Exile {{brought out}} in me, in {{addition}} to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling for the universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> own country from other people's point of view, and from which to live for the enormity of its misfortune.|$|E

The verb is imperative, and apparently it is not reasonable to use [...] "no" [...] with a vocative noun. It is a contradiction to address [...] "no spot!" [...] I am afraid this is rather muddled; I used <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> Latin grammar but it has faded ... I wish another book could be planned out before the summer, if we are going on with them, I always feel very much lost when they are finished.|$|E
500|$|Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo, and Masashi Hamauzu {{created the}} {{arrangements}} for the concert. Valtonen and Wanamo had previously worked with Böcker on the concerts in the Symphonic series, and Böcker has stated {{that if they had}} been unavailable for the project he would not have created Final Symphony at all. Hamauzu, in addition to arranging the Final Fantasy X music, was one of the composers of the original pieces he arranged. Uematsu, who composed music for all three games, served as a consultant for the project, though he did not arrange any pieces. When they first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took a few months to play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games. They did not research other arrangements that have been done of the pieces, as they feel the general approach to video game music orchestration is very different from their style. They then got together to propose which tracks would be arranged, and decide which soundtracks worked best as a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, or a symphony. They chose a symphonic poem for VI, a piano concerto for X, and a symphony in three movements for VII. Böcker gave the team direction, and coordinated the arrangers in discussing and deciding which tracks to arrange. During the process of actually creating the arrangements, however, Böcker was not involved; he feels that the arrangers are [...] "masters of their art" [...] and should have the freedom to create what they want. Nevertheless, the arrangers were communicating via e-mail sharing their work in progress with Böcker: [...] "If there are questions, or if they wish <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> opinion, I am there".|$|E

2500|$|She {{received}} {{a degree from}} Yale University in French, graduating cum laude [...] and then decided {{to pursue a career}} in singing. [...] Anderson studied voice under Robert Leonard in New York City. [...] She had numerous auditions but no engagements at first. [...] She has said that she continued her pursuit as a challenge, giving herself a deadline of two years (after which she would, if unsuccessful, enter law school). [...] "No one wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> name. I was down to my last $50. That's when I decided I {{was going to be a}} singer if it killed me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bambi relates in the biography, Indian Larry: Chopper Shaman, {{stories about}} how she first knew about Larry and the {{experiences}} that occurred before they came {{to be in a}} relationship. [...] Before they officially started to date in 1997, they hung out together at a bar and Larry kept putting quarters in the jukebox, playing romantic songs by Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. [...] This was when he was still drinking, and Bambi wrote that at one point he started crying, and said to her, “No one else is ever really going <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> soul". And Bambi thought to herself, “I will. I could do that.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the awkwardness {{that takes place}} between two people after they break up. Chris Willman of Yahoo! Music thought the key lyrics of the song are [...] "I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how/I've never heard silence quite this loud" [...] and also [...] "I would lay my armor down, if you would say you'd rather love than fight." [...] In a {{different}} perspective, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly considered these couplets from the song, ("I used <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> place was the spot next to you / Now I’m searching the room for an empty seat / ‘Cause lately I don’t even know what page you’re on"), {{as one of the}} best couplets from Speak Now sheet. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine claims that the song describes [...] "a young woman who is at turns sharp and snide, but who is nonetheless defined by relationships." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodrem {{states that}} [...] "This time around I {{had time to}} think 'What kind of song do I want to create here?'", [...] "I really felt the sky was the limit with this record, you could do {{anything}} in a song. I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been keeping an eye on Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> thoughts".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{references}} {{are made to}} previous multi-Doctor anniversary stories, The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors. The Eleventh Doctor's dismissal of the Tenth Doctor and War Doctor as [...] "Sandshoes and Grandad" [...] to mock their respective footwear and age echo the First Doctor's description of his two successors in The Three Doctors as [...] "a dandy and a clown". (The War Doctor's initial incredulous reaction upon seeing his future selves also reflects this moment.) Likewise, a Time Lord says, [...] "I didn't know when I was well-off. All twelve of them." [...] which recalls the Brigadier's line from The Three Doctors: [...] "Three of them, eh? I didn't know when I was well off." [...] More of the Brigadier's dialogue from the latter serial is alluded to when Kate asks for an incident report code-named [...] "Cromer"; in the earlier story, upon being transported to another universe, the Brigadier initially believes himself to be near the coastal Norfolk town. A line from the First Doctor from The Five Doctors is also reused near the end as the Tenth Doctor tells the Eleventh, [...] "It's good <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> future is in safe hands" [...] (which the First told the Fifth in the earlier story, appended by [...] "after all"). When the War Doctor appears, Clara remarks, [...] "I think there's three of them," [...] to which Kate responds, [...] "There's a precedent for that," [...] in reference to The Three Doctors.|$|E

2500|$|Sandé {{began working}} {{in the studio with}} Naughty Boy in 2009, where the pair first worked {{together}} on Chipmunk's debut album I Am Chipmunk. When Sandé was 16 years of age, her parents took her to Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor Tour and she said she always wanted Keys to hear her music. She spoke on why she likes Keys so much; [...] "I'd read about her background and identified with her on so many levels. She was mixed race like me, a great student who'd been top of her class, who played piano and loved Nina Simone. And there she was in the pop charts, yet with songs that had a message. I saw 16,000 people hanging on her every word and thought, [...] "I want this kind of attention. I want Alicia <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> music." [...] The pair met when Sandé had just came back from New York and just began a second songwriting stint, but this time involved with Keys. The pair sat at a piano and played for hours {{trying to come up with}} a good track. She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the lyric, rather than there just be throwaway pop music. Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill were also major influences for the album.|$|E
