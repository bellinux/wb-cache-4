5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

25|$|Luke’s {{concern for}} {{the rich and the poor}} {{continues}} in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the community of goods for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (5.1–11; 8.14–24).|$|E
25|$|Water: The water {{signs are}} Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and {{find it hard to}} look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can find it difficult to explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people.

500|$|The Church {{leaders of}} later centuries inscribed Sunday rest into {{official}} Church teaching, and Christian governments {{have attempted to}} enforce the Sunday rest throughout history. For Catholics, Jesus' teaching that [...] "the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath" [...] means that good works [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> demand it" [...] {{can be part of}} the day of rest. The Catechism offers guidelines on how to observe the Lord's Day, which include attending Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation.

500|$|Stage two (self-interest driven) {{expresses the}} [...] "what's {{in it for}} me" [...] position, in which right {{behavior}} is defined by whatever the individual believes {{to be in their}} best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a [...] "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" [...] mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level {{is quite different from the}} social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.|$|E

2500|$|Studies {{have also}} been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> has {{conversely}} negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, {{it is also important}} for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that [...] "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.". Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others, doing good and subsequently feeling good as [...] "the helper's high".|$|E

In America the she-ro is diagnosed early due to adherence to early screening recommendations, and, by definition, survives her diagnosis. The role emphasizes the femininity and female gender role of the she-ro, offsetting the masculine characteristics of assertiveness, selfishness and [...] "fighting" [...] cancer by cultivating a feminine appearance and concern for others. [...] After treatment, the she-ro regains her femininity by using breast reconstruction, prosthetic devices, wigs, cosmetics, and clothing to present an aesthetically appealing, upper-class, heterosexual feminine appearance and by maintaining relationships in which she can nurture other people. [...] Ensuring the proper feeling rules of the breast cancer culture is encouraged, including remaining optimistic of a full cure, rationalizing the selfishness of treatment as a temporary measure and feeling guilty that it forces her to put her needs momentarily above <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> or due to her perceived inadequacy in caring for her family or other women with cancer.

She questioned the justness of her own conclusions, of her own deeds: she had been rash, arrogant, always dissatisfied that others were not good enough, while she herself had not been true to what her soul had once recognised as the best.
