5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
500|$|The {{resolution}} to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring {{the voices of}} the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club writes that the silence imposed by The Gentlemen is a metaphor for how evil spreads: [...] "When dissent is stifled, or people fail to tell the truth, or when we’re just distracted by other concerns, things can get out of hand." [...] Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor's office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town's endemic evil or choose not <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> During [...] "Hush", at Giles' apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, [...] "ow many times will we see those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds? It is not surprising that [...] attendants wear straitjackets; their garb suggests the insanity of such behavior—the pretense of civilized politeness while killing is accepted is a matter of course." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like a lot {{of other}} people, I first became aware that a {{promising}} young player named David Campese had arrived on the scene when he appeared in a curtain-raiser to a Test against [...] at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982. Campese was playing for the Australian under 21s against the New Zealand under 21s. I was a reserve that day for the Test, so I was in the dressing-room and did not watch the curtain-raiser myself, but I soon came <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Although [...] won the Test against [...] handsomely, all the talk after the match was about the performance in the curtain-raiser by the fullback from Canberra. Everyone who watched Campese that day had been astonished by his ability.|$|E
6000|$|I {{expressed}} my regret. I {{should have}} liked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> this {{he said that}} it was not a secret and that perhaps next time we met. [...] .|$|R
60|$|No {{one wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They shrunk {{from him as}} though he were a robber. Only the little brown girl was sorry, and she looked at him with dark, soft eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{took his}} hat and went out. Then Jill came flying in <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I told her as well as I could, but she wasn't satisfied. If Dick took it so quietly, she declared, I couldn't have made it strong enough.|$|R
2500|$|In 1965, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions {{evolved into}} the Warlocks, with the {{addition}} of Phil Lesh on bass guitar and Bill Kreutzmann on percussion. However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the Velvet Underground) was performing under their newly selected name, prompting another name change. Garcia came up with [...] "Grateful Dead" [...] by opening a Funk & Wagnalls dictionary to an entry for [...] "Grateful dead". The definition for [...] "Grateful Dead" [...] was [...] "a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial". The band's first reaction was disapproval. Garcia later explained the group's reaction: [...] "I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [...] Weir didn't like it, [...] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] " [...] Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E

60|$|Amy {{expressed}} deep {{interest in}} this matter, and begged <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Lucy, nothing loath, related the event circumstantially; and Amy, gazing earnestly in her beautiful animated countenance, sighed and regarded her {{with an expression of}} sad interest,--also with feelings which she herself could not understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, mamma, that {{my uncle}} Phillips talks of turning away Richard; {{and if he}} does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>to</b> ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town." ...|$|R
60|$|The double {{funeral was}} {{accomplished}} {{while she was}} still too ill <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> though Mrs. Lucas had no doubt that she knew; and when he came home, Colonel Brownlow called for Janet, and asked her whether she could find her grandmother's keys and her father's for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Bill, I {{think your}} best {{plan would be}} to go {{straight}} to father and tell him the whole thing.--You don't want him <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in a roundabout way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you came}} to my house when I wasn’t at home," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Vickers, in a trembling but sarcastic voice. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> That’s what I’ve come for." ...|$|E
6000|$|Katie and Fanny {{declared}} {{they would}} be charmed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and Queeker said, in a savagely jesting tone, {{that he was so}} used to things being inflicted on him, that he didn't mind--rather liked it than otherwise! ...|$|E
50|$|Circa 2000, London Weekend Television made a British {{version of}} Grudge Match (which {{did not have}} the word the in its title), hosted by Nick Weir and Lisa Rogers, and {{featured}} former boxing champion Barry McGuigan as the referee. Instead of the typical challenges as seen on the US version, the challenges were more made in the style of Gladiators, the show which Grudge Match replaced. The winner got a bonus prize, as in the US version, but the loser had to pay a forfeit. The prizes and forfeits were based on the storylines of the grudge. Occasionally Lisa would talk to audience members who were relatives and/or friends of the contenders prior <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from the contenders' perspectives. This show also ran just one series on weekends on ITV prime time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And Edmund, dear Edmund, {{was always}} so kind and so fond of Gilbert!' said Lucy. 'You would not have thought they were twins, Edmund was so much the tallest and strongest. It seemed so odd that Gilbert should have got over it, when he did not. Should you like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> mamma?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Wilkinson {{now joined}} his comrades, who were {{gathered}} {{a short distance}} away waiting until he had finished his talk with Sir Sidney. [...] "Come down below, Wilkinson, and give us the news. We heard that you had taken some prizes from the pirates; we want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Is Blagrove all right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I wrote {{some days}} ago, but the letter only went yesterday. She {{will be pleased}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Dear old Jess, I wonder when she means to come home again. She has been away long enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but my {{news will}} keep. You are too much excited <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just now. Enough {{to say that}} I am much better. Now, if you are wise, you will go without delay and take some steps about this affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The matter?" [...] he replied. [...] "It's {{all very}} well for you two to be talking away like mermaids about the wonders of this cave; but you know I must be content <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> while you are enjoying yourselves down there like mad dolphins. It's really too bad!" ...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} two prodigious {{football}} talents, of their extraordinary rise to greatness {{in the early days}} of the AFL, and what happened to them, on and off the field. A truly Australian story, one that we don 2 ̆ 7 t always want <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>about</b> what <b>it</b> 2 ̆ 7 s like to be black in a sports-worshipping white culture...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too {{touching}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> you reason <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Fancy me telling such {{a hideous}} story--about myself--me--me!" [...] And {{she touched her}} breasts with her white fingers.|$|R
6000|$|She went {{indoors and}} rather coldly {{told her mother}} of the proposal. Mrs. Garland, though she had {{determined}} not to answer the miller's question on matrimony just yet, was quite ready for this jaunt, {{and in spite of}} Anne she sailed off at once to the garden <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> When she re- entered, she said-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think one}} of the rummiest affairs I was ever mixed up with, {{in the course of a}} {{lifetime}} devoted to butting into other people's business, was that affair of George Lattaker at Monte Carlo. I wouldn't bore you, don't you know, for the world, but I think you ought <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She pushed hers {{through my}} arm as we {{started for the}} dining-room, and leaned over to whisper jubilantly: [...] "That will fix it. He will see how much his {{precious}} lower classes care for Altruria {{if they have to}} pay a dollar apiece <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And I shall keep faith with him to the letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think I am a perfect crank," [...] said Miss Sally, sighing. [...] "Well, I'll {{tell you why}} I don't trust men. I {{have a very good}} reason for it. A man broke my heart and embittered my life. I've never spoken about it to a living soul, but if you want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} not be {{disturbed}} {{for at least a}} quarter of an hour," [...] she said, [...] "and I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You are very pretty, I am glad to see, dear," [...] she said, looking at Virginia contemplatively. [...] "I hate plain girls. What did you say that your name was?" ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{had enough}} of the thing. I want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Let them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don't want to get mixed up in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{he smiled}} a bit, and a'ter {{that he seemed}} more cur'ous than ever <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I told him my third v'y'ge was to Canton, with a cargo of broom-corn, where we took in salmon and dun-fish for home. A'ter that we went to Norway with ice, and brought back silks and money. Our next run was to the Havana, with salt and 'nips--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pulmonary haemorrhage!" [...] said Courthorne. [...] "Perhaps it {{was born}} in me, but I never had much trouble until after {{that night in the}} snow at the river. Would you care <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> We're not fond of each other, but after the steer-drivers I've been herding with, it's a relief to talk to a man of {{moderate}} intelligence." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} {{something}} of my experimental work. She {{had never heard}} of the soaring aeroplane, and was excited by the thought, and keen <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She had thought all the work so far had been a mere projecting of impossible machines. For her Pilcher and Lilienthal had died in vain. She did not know such men had lived in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... “Everybody {{talked about}} her goodness, and the Prince of the country got <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and he said that}} as she was so very good she might be allowed once a week to walk in his park, which was just outside the town. It was a {{beautiful}} park, and no children were ever allowed in it, so it was a great honour for Bertha to be allowed to go there.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that brings}} us back to the same story. I suppose Walker has no {{objection}} <b>to</b> your <b>hearing</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I don't know why we should make any secret <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> though it is certainly a pretty bad business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Emmeline," [...] said Ayala, {{putting on}} all the serious dignity which {{she knew how to}} assume, [...] "I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs, and nothing on earth that anybody can say can change it. If you want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Lady Albury will tell you. She knows that you are my aunt, and {{therefore}} she will be quite willing to talk to you. Only nothing that anybody can say can change it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was on {{the other}} side of the platform, miss; waiting for the train from London. I got to the station and gave him the telegram, just as the {{accident}} took place. We crossed over <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Mr. Mirabel was telling me that he would return to 'The Clink' on my horse--when he heard the woman's name mentioned. Upon that, he changed his mind and went to the house." ...|$|R
