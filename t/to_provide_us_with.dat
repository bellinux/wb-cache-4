[...] In 1981 [...] John Paul II, then pope of the Roman Catholic Church, spoke of the relationship this way: [...] "The Bible itself speaks to us {{of the origin of}} the universe and its make-up, not in order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe.

2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E

[...] Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu claimed that [...] "the intermission leaves you wondering at the frivolousness and facileness of the story that's very much unlike Bala. Nothing much happens in the first hour or so. Thankfully, he makes amends with a riveting climax." [...] A critic from Oneindia.in cited: [...] "Watch the film for the expression of ‘Nava Rasas’ just after the interval bang and the climax scene and you will get a feel that it is a 100 per cent paisa vasool." [...] Chennai Onlines reviewer stated that Bala had [...] "attempted <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a film that has comical elements as its major strength. He has gone overboard and failed to present it with coherent script. As a result the movie {{turns out to be a}} disappointing experience despite having stunning performances", while Indiaglitz commented: [...] "All said, Avan Ivan is not a typical Bala film, and it has its own dull moments, courtesy cliched scenes and dragging second half. But it also has many ingredients to entertain the masses." [...] CNN-IBN wrote: [...] "Overall Avan Ivan suffers from a sloppy script despite having some fine performances. The lack of balance between Bala's emphatic portrayal of different kind of life and his effort to provide fun is the major problem of the movie. The fun becomes farce and the seriousness turns out to be ineffective." ...|$|E

As can be seen from a review of literature, there are many different ways that we can investigate drama education. If we accept Goodson & Walkers' (1991) view that the task of research is to 'make sense of what we know', then the sense we make of our teaching and learning will be somewhat limited if we only employ mainstream empirical methods to research drama workplaces. In my considered view, such approaches are best suited <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a macro view of drama education, but fall short of allowing a close view of the richness of life within drama classrooms...|$|R
