25|$|The {{kauri gum}} {{industry}} became established around Matakohe in 1867-70, possibly {{the first place}} in the Kaipara District that the industry developed amongst settlers. A flax mill was built in 1870, but it was not profitable and was soon converted to a <b>timber</b> <b>mill.</b> This was replaced by a larger <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> in the 1880s. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1906. Matakohe held a race-day each February, in which were entries from as far as Kaiwaka and Waipu.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the {{catchment}} {{area for the}} reservoir was used for cattle and sheep grazing and also housed several <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> settlements. As soon after completion as 1892, concerns were raised that this new water source was getting polluted by raw sewage from the timber mills as well as excrement from the livestock.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>timber</b> <b>mills</b> in {{the area}} {{included}} Kudardup, Boranup and Jarrahdene. Between 1900 and 1914 approximately 17 million railway sleepers were cut from <b>timber</b> <b>milled</b> in the region.|$|R
50|$|The main {{industry}} in Mamaku was originally native timber logging. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Mamaku had, at one time, 5 <b>timber</b> <b>mills,</b> all logging native timber {{from the surrounding}} bush. This reduced over time and today there are no <b>timber</b> <b>mills</b> operating in the village.|$|R

25|$|Bouldon Mill is Grade II Listed former mill {{building}} in the hamlet, now a residence/therapy centre, which still has the Coalbrookdale iron-cast water wheel (using {{the flow of the}} Pye Brook) and inside workings. The stone building was built in 1790 but there was a <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> beforehand built in 1611. It may have operated as a mill as late as the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Forsaith {{established}} himself as a farmer and trader in the Kaipara District. He bought land in 1839 on the Wairoa River near present-day Dargaville. He was likely to have been the first European settler in the area. He built a <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> for cutting Kauri spars, as the British Government was purchasing these at Â£17 each. He cleared land for wheat and running cattle, which he had to import. By May 1841, he had fenced 12 acres of cleared land, most of it growing wheat.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cases of}} typhoid fever {{occurred}} at a <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> in the catchment in 1892, {{at a time when}} typhoid fever became increasingly prevalent in Perth. Between 1895 and 1900, there were 4047 cases and 425 deaths from typhoid fever in Perth, and the water supply was suspected to be contaminated. In response to this, in 1896 the Colonial Government purchased the scheme, including the dam, pipelines and Mount Eliza reservoir. In 1897, a sample of the water from the reservoir was found to contain the bacteria causing typhoid fever, and strict by-laws were implemented to prosecute any cases of pollution of the water catchment. Also, a channel was cut to divert the Munday Brook water (polluted by the timber mills) away from the reservoir.|$|E

25|$|In 1871 Waitetuna {{residents}} {{agreed to}} build a school, but an 1872 flood washed away the timber for the scheme. A half-time school and a private school ran for a while. Waitetuna School District was gazetted in 1873, but the Education Rate proved insufficient to pay {{the teacher and the}} school closed in 1875. A new school on donated land opened, with a teacher's residence added in 1877 and an adjacent 11 acres added by the Waste Lands Board in 1878. As early as 1882 a petition requested the school be moved away from the damp hollow, but nothing happened until the main road was diverted through the grounds in 1906. On 24 August 1903 Waitetuna School changed its name to Te Uku. In August 1908 the present school was established about 800 metres to the east, with one room on another 2 acres of donated land. Inadvertently, an acre of Church land was taken by the school until sold for a post office and store in 1923. A second classroom was added in 1935, a teacher's house in 1941, a concrete play area in 1948, a football paddock leased from 1951, a prefab added in 1954, a lavatory block in 1957, a school pool in 1961 and the Aramiro School building moved here in 1965. Ohautira Maori School closed in 1969, shortly after the <b>timber</b> <b>mill,</b> and in 1975 another classroom was added.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} budget cutbacks, Southern Oregon has used tourism {{as a means}} of {{attracting}} small businesses and retirees. The movement of California retirees in particular has helped the economy grow. Although jobs have been created as a result, they are usually low-paying. [...] Today the principal industries are tourism, timber and agriculture. [...] Since about 1960, the community has evolved into a center for wine, retirement, tourism, and small businesses. [...] One <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> remains in Cave Junction, Rough & Ready Lumber Co., located six miles (10km) south of town. [...] In November 2007, Rough & Ready completed a $6 million biomass plant to replace their existing wood-fired boiler, as market forces have increased demand for dry timber. It finally closed in November, 2016.|$|E

50|$|Although now a {{small rural}} town, Raetihi {{was a minor}} {{industrial}} centre between 1900 and the 1950s.

The two most prominent agricultural activities are cattle farming and vegetable growing and they now provide the bulk of employment as the <b>timber</b> <b>mills</b> have closed.|$|R

2500|$|... {{a privately}} owned 43-wagon-capacity siding was laid several chains {{to the north}} of Cruickshanks Tunnel to serve a <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> that was owned, {{constructed}} and operated by James Cruickshanks, a member of the Wellington Provincial Council. [...] His siding handled only timber traffic, but also became a stopping place for main line trains, and was known as Cruickshanks. [...] He later built a second mill about half a mile closer to Mangaroa station, but the first remained in use until 1889 when the siding was lifted. [...] The second mill operated its own tramway between the mill and station yard where timber was transferred to railway wagons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line was}} run as two {{separate}} branches from Tuatapere: the Tuatapere Branch from Invercargill, and the Orawia Branch. [...] During {{the days of}} steam motive power, most services on the branches were operated from a depot at Tuatapere. [...] Trains were typically mixed, carrying both passengers and freight. One such train daily operated from Tuatapere to Invercargill and return, while another ran Invercargill to Tuatapere and return. [...] Orawia was served by a service from Tuatapere on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. [...] Along the line, a lucrative logging industry was established and many bush tramways were built to provide easy cartage of logs to the railway line. [...] A <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> was established in Tuatapere to process the logs and it provided much traffic for the railway. [...] In {{the early days of}} the line, oil shale was a prominent source of freight from Orepuki. [...] The railway was also indispensable in helping to develop the Waiau River valley and its settlements.|$|E
2500|$|Noll {{was born}} on 16 September 1975 in Orange, New South Wales to Neil and Sharyn Noll. He {{grew up in the}} small town of Condobolin in central western New South Wales as the {{youngest}} of three children with his older brothers Adam and Damian. Noll spent his entire childhood and teenage years on the family farm, which raised sheep and cattle and grew cereal crops. At school, Noll enjoyed drama classes and performed in school productions. After leaving school, Noll travelled to Sydney where he met his wife Rochelle Ogston and played AFL. As an adult, Noll worked shearing sheep among other tasks. He and his brothers formed the band called Cypress (named after the Cypress pine <b>timber</b> <b>mill</b> where they rehearsed). Noll provided vocals and played guitar. In gigs around the Australian outback, the band played in country pubs. Although they performed mainly covers, the group also wrote original music. Noll's father Neil was killed during a farming accident in 2001, which left the farm to him and his brothers. After two years of extreme drought, Noll leased the farm out and got by on drought support money and odd-jobbing on a friend's farm. Noll penned a song on his album Lift titled [...] "Now I Run" [...] in his father's memory.|$|E
