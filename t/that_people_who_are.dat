5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

25|$|It {{also seems}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more {{creative}} {{are also more}} likely to show a similar pattern of brain activation. Some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness, as it is still not clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.|$|E

25|$|In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence. For example, Guru Arjan explains <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.|$|E
25|$|In three {{separate}} studies, including one with Catholics and Protestants from Northern Ireland whose {{family members were}} murdered in the political violence, he found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> taught how to forgive become less angry, feel less hurt, are more optimistic, become more forgiving {{in a variety of}} situations, and become more compassionate and self-confident. His studies show a reduction in experience of stress, physical manifestations of stress, and an increase in vitality.|$|E
25|$|The {{prenatal}} hormonal {{theory of}} sexual orientation suggests <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|A {{pilot project}} that {{commenced}} in late 2009, J2SI provides {{one of the}} most in depth studies of long-term homelessness ever undertaken in Australia. Sacred Heart Mission developed the pilot in recognition <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> long-term homeless are currently using expensive services yet their homelessness is not being addressed. J2SI provides three years of intense support for 40 people who are long-term homeless and aims to demonstrate that breaking the cycle of homeless has both social and economic benefits for the community. Funded from both philanthropic sources and government, this program relies on service partnerships with several health, welfare and social research agencies. The social aspects of the pilot are being evaluated by the Australian Housing and Research Institute at RMIT. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at The University of Melbourne is evaluating the economic impact.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism {{is a broad}} {{term for}} any {{drinking}} of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> nondrinkers should start drinking wine.|$|E
25|$|People with a {{homosexual}} orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety}} of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own gender identity, though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender, bisexual relationships, or none at all (celibacy). Survey data indicates that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship. Survey data also indicate that between 18% and 28% of gay couples and between 8% and 21% of lesbian couples in the U.S. have lived together ten or more years. Studies have found same-sex and opposite-sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in relationships, that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation as a predictor of satisfaction and commitment to a relationship, and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships.|$|E

500|$|While some asexuals masturbate as {{a solitary}} form of release or have sex {{for the benefit}} of a romantic partner, others do not (see above).

[...] This means that [...] "while the body becomes aroused, subjectively – {{at the level of the}} mind and emotions – one does not experience arousal".|$|E
500|$|After leaving Scientology, Beghe {{contacted}} Andreas Heldal-Lund, {{founder of}} Operation Clambake, who {{convinced him to}} meet with journalist and Scientology critic Mark Bunker. Heldal-Lund and Bunker went to Beghe's house, where Beghe participated in an interview about his experiences as a Scientologist. Bunker published a three-minute portion of the three-hour interview to YouTube in mid-April 2008, and in the video Beghe calls Scientology [...] "very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution." [...] The interview closes with Beghe stating, [...] "I don't have an agenda. I'm just trying to help.

50|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Honesty-Humility {{has been shown}} to be {{negatively}} correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). This effect is moderated by interest in politics, such <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> high in Honesty-Humility and very interested in politics scored at half the levels on the SDO scale as compared to their low interest counterparts, Both groups, though, with high Honesty-Humility scores were below baseline on SDO.|$|R

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unfamiliar {{with the process of}} silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{would accept}} {{that there has}} to be {{compromise}} and obviously Northern Ireland has been a very difficult problem. However, in my view the Republic of Ireland was a separate sovereign state; at the time Frank was shot the Republic of Ireland was not at war and I find it very hard to accept that Frank's killers, if you like, should be part of the agreement at all. It is a small comfort, but it is a comfort to know <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> convicted were doing time ... that at least Frank's life and his work for the State had not been in vain.|$|R
5000|$|Passing {{through a}} tunnel is {{compared}} to the birth canal, and the silver cord resembling the umbilical cord - these are a few observations during out-of-body experiences that are sometimes likened to childbirth.

2500|$|In {{a speech}} in 1942 Rabbi Joseph Ber Soloveitchik, praised {{the efforts of the}} Chabad Lubavitch {{campaign}} to raise awareness to the coming of the Masiach.

50|$|Another study {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> dieting often used upward social comparisons by posting pictures of thinner {{people on their}} refrigerators.
