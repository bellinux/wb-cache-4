5|$|Season 1964–65 saw Celtic {{back in the}} Inter-Cities Fairs cup. First round opponents were Portuguese side Leixões S.C.. The {{first leg}} away in Portual was ill-tempered and marred by {{eccentric}} referring decisions in a 1–1 draw. Stevie Chalmers and Ian Young were both controversially sent off; Chalmers for a minor collision with the Leixões goalkeeper as they both jumped for the ball, Young for a minor scuffle with an opponent (who was also sent off). Celtic won the return match in Glasgow 3–0 to progress, although the game was again bad tempered. In the next round Celtic faced Barcelona. The Spaniards won 20 at the Nou Camp and held Celtic to a goalless draw at Parkhead {{in a series of}} ties where <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> outclassed their opponents.|$|E
25|$|Christianity in China {{experienced}} a significant revival during the Mongol-created Yuan dynasty, established after the Mongols had conquered China in the 13th century. Marco Polo in the 13th century and other medieval Western writers described many Nestorian communities remaining in China and Mongolia; however, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> {{were not as}} vibrant {{as they had been}} during Tang times.|$|E

25|$|Some Jewish historians {{suggest a}} {{different}} {{explanation for the}} rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome’s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the AD 135 experience.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the poems post-date the Eclogues of Virgil. Since their publication, the poems have usually been dated to Neronian times (AD 54- 68) (more specifically, the first fragment is sometimes dated to AD 64 or 65) in which case, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> pre-date the Eclogues of Nemesianus and may, or may not, pre-date the Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus. However, Stover argues that the poems were written during the (probably later) 4th century AD.|$|E
25|$|Lythronax argestes {{belongs to}} the family Tyrannosauridae, a family of large-bodied coelurosaurs, with most genera known from North America and Asia. A {{detailed}} phylogenetic analysis, based on 303 cranial and 198 postcranial features, places it and Teratophoneus within Tyrannosaurinae. Lythronax is a sister taxon of a clade consisting of the Maastrichtian taxa Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the late Campanian Zhuchengtyrannus. Lythronax probably was not a direct ancestor of Tyrannosaurus. If not, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> shared a common ancestor that was even older than Lythronax.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Brogden was {{chairman}} of the Solway Junction Railway so <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> had a substantial stake in that railway but their precise involvement is not clear. For this railway the Act of Parliament was passed in 1864 and the railway was opened in 1869 (goods only) and 1870 (goods and passengers). James Brunlees, previously noted, was the engineer. It was a failure in the long run because the cast iron viaduct could not withstand the ice-floes which were a regular feature of the winters here.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Chicago {{industrialist}} Robert Irsay {{purchased the}} Rams for $19 million and then traded the franchise to Carroll Rosenbloom for his Baltimore Colts and cash. The Rams remained solid contenders in the 1970s, winning seven straight NFC West championships between 1973–79. Though <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> were {{the class of}} the NFC in the 1970s along with the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings, they lost the first four conference championship games they played in that decade, losing twice each to Minnesota (1974, 1976) and Dallas (1975, 1978) and failing to win a league championship.|$|E
25|$|Whereas PCFGs {{have proved}} {{powerful}} tools for predicting RNA secondary structure, usage {{in the field}} of protein sequence analysis has been limited. Indeed, the size of the amino acid alphabet and the variety of interactions seen in proteins make grammar inference much more challenging. As a consequence, most applications of formal language theory to protein analysis have been mainly restricted to the production of grammars of lower expressive power to model simple functional patterns based on local interactions. Since protein structures commonly display higher-order dependencies including nested and crossing relationships, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> exceed the capabilities of any CFG. Still, development of PCFGs allows expressing some of those dependencies and providing the ability to model a wider range of protein patterns.|$|E

25|$|Edwin H. Colbert has {{suggested}} that the theropod footprints referred to the ichnogenus Grallator, located in the Connecticut River Valley across Connecticut and Massachusetts, may have been made by Coelophysis. The footprints are from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic aged Newark Supergroup. <b>They</b> <b>clearly</b> show digits II III and IV but not I or V. That condition is strange for footprints of their age. The digits were presumed to be stubby and ineffective, not touching the ground when the dinosaur was walking or running. They have been thought to be from an unidentified, primitive saurischian similar to Coelophysis by David B. Weishampel and L. Young more recently. Skeletal remains resembling Coelophysis have also been found in the valley, supporting the idea that a species similar to Coelophysis is responsible for the footprints.|$|E
25|$|At art {{exhibitions}} {{the visitor}} usually {{is not allowed}} to touch the displayed objects, not even when <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> have a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore, Noten used a funfair machine he called Mr Claw to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. Mr Claw contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be lifted by the grabber). Mr Claw was used at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the Icon Experiment 2008 exhibition in London, UK.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hindemith's music {{employs a}} unique {{system that is}} tonal but non-diatonic. Like most tonal music, it is centred on a tonic and modulates from one tonal centre to another, but it uses all 12 notes freely {{rather than relying on}} a scale picked as a subset of these notes. Hindemith even rewrote some of his music after {{developing}} this system. One of the key features of his system is that he ranks all musical intervals of the 12-tone equally tempered scale from the most consonant to the most dissonant. He classifies chords in six categories, on the basis of how dissonant they are, whether or not they contain a tritone, and whether or not <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> suggest a root or tonal centre. Hindemith's philosophy also encompassed melody—he strove for melodies that do not clearly outline major or minor triads.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1991, the Soviet Union {{had reached}} a state of emergency. According to the {{official}} commission (the Soviet Academy of Sciences) appointed by the Supreme Soviet (the higher chamber of the Russian parliament) immediately after the events of August 1991, the Army did not {{play a significant role}} in what some describe as coup d'état of old-guard communists. Commanders sent tanks into the streets of Moscow, but (according to all the commanders and soldiers) only with orders to ensure the safety of the people. It remains unclear why exactly the military forces entered the city, but <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> did not have the goal of overthrowing Gorbachev (absent on the Black Sea coast at the time) or the government. The coup failed primarily because the participants did not take any decisive action, and after several days of their inaction the coup simply stopped. Only one confrontation took place between civilians and the tank crews during the coup, which led to the deaths of three civilians. Although the victims became proclaimed heroes, the authorities acquitted the tank crew of all charges. Nobody issued orders to shoot at anyone.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the Ostoja families in Lithuania and Poland avoided engagement in this political chaos. The king was appointing those that supported his own ambitions, which was {{the beginning}} of some new great fortunes. This political disaster ended in Partitions of Poland, 1772 when Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to divide defenseless Commonwealth between them. Poniatowski's reign until 1795 became the darkest chapter in Polish history. The Constitution of May 3, 1791 came far too late. This {{was the first time that}} the Commonwealth included Ruthenians and not just Poland and Lithuania. New Commonwealth was to be formed of three nations. Also this intention came far too late. However, the Constitution of May 3 united families that wanted to make necessary changes and that would serve the nation. In this movement we suddenly see lot of activity from the Ostoja families. Almost all of them supported the movement and in many cases all members of the family joined, women and men. In the first half of the century, the Ostoja families hold many offices and was still prospecting. In the second half of the century, <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> turned into military commanders and supporters of the resistance, leading Confederations and armies against foreign forces and specially against Russia.|$|E
25|$|The railroads {{opened up}} the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was {{possible}} to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools.|$|E

25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who {{were out in}} the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E

Due to their {{enormous}} range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare, but <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments.

500|$|Botanically, [...] "spines" [...] are {{distinguished}} from [...] "thorns": spines are modified leaves, and thorns are modified branches. Cacti produce spines, always from areoles as noted above. Spines are present {{even in those}} cacti with leaves, such as Pereskia, Pereskiopsis and Maihuenia, so <b>they</b> <b>clearly</b> evolved before complete leaflessness. Some cacti only have spines when young, possibly only when seedlings. This is particularly true of tree-living cacti, such as Rhipsalis or Schlumbergera, but some ground-living cacti, such as Ariocarpus, also lack spines when mature.|$|E
