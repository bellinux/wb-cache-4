40|$|Paganism {{is one of}} the world's {{fastest-growing}} religions, practised in a huge {{variety of}} ways. The Paganism Reader provides a definitive collection of key sources in Paganism, ranging from its ancient origins to its twentieth-century reconstruction and revival. Chronologically organized sections include extracts from ancient Greek, Norse and Celtic literature, inspirational texts from <b>the</b> early <b>twentieth-century,</b> <b>writings</b> by leaders of the Pagan revival, and newer perspectives showing the diversity of Paganism today. Witchcraft, nature religion, shamanism and goddess worship are considered, as is the influence of environmental and feminist movements. Fully introduced, with editors' prefaces to all extracts and suggestions for further reading, this comprehensive book is an invaluable guide to Paganism and critical issues in its study. ...|$|R

The author documents and describes their strategy and recommended policy approach for improved industrial relations. The three core components of their strategy were stabilization of markets, equalization of bargaining power, and constitutional government in industrial enterprise. The author also shows that the thinking of Commons and his associates on {{the best way to}} achieve these three goals—and, in particular, their view of the appropriate mix of trade unionism, labor law, personnel management, and macroeconomic monetary/ fiscal policy—evolved through four distinct phases, starting about 1900 and ending in the late 1930 s...|$|R

40|$|While {{literary}} {{writers have}} responded creatively to Darwinism since its beginnings with "The Origin of Species" (1859), literary scholarship has reacted accordingly — but not within Greece. Literary scholarship which takes a Darwinian {{approach to the}} various genres of modern Greek literature is scant {{in proportion to the}} plethora of scholarship on non-Greek Darwinian literature. This paper is derived from a section of my doctoral thesis which examines Darwinian and other evolutionary thought in <b>the</b> early <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writings</b> of Grigorios Xenopoulos. The paper provides a synoptic view of the Darwinian thought in selected letters written by Xenopoulos in the children’s magazine Η Διάπλασις των Παίδων ('The Children’s Guidance'), which was published between 1879 and 1948. It focuses on the gender issue, the issue of religion versus science and in particular creationism versus evolution theory; and finally Xenopoulos’ use of Darwinian concepts, such as gradualism, in discussing human character. The paper not only provides some insight into Xenopoulos but also reflects the impact of evolutionary ideas in society at the time, at a local and international level...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} <b>the</b> early <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writings</b> of four modernist writers – Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, D. H. Lawrence, and Wyndham Lewis – {{in relation}} to the problem of utopianism. The introductory chapter provides an overview of current scholarly debates concerning the nature and structure of utopian thinking, and establishes the broad context in which the above writers are considered in the argument that follows. The thesis works with an inclusive definition of utopianism that views it as an expression of the urge to better society, as opposed to an urge to realize social perfection. After a wide-ranging summary of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century utopian discourses, a summary that attends to the pre-First World War criticism of T. E. Hulme and Ezra Pound, the thesis turns to individual, ‘case study’ chapters that focus on the above-mentioned quartet of writers. Each chapter looks at a key issue: Conrad {{in relation to}} political anarchism; Ford in relation to urban design; Lawrence in relation to utopian philosophies of labour; and Lewis {{in relation to the}} linkages between the historical avant-garde and the betterment of society. The main claims running throughout the thesis are that in the period under consideration the links between modernism and utopianism are: complex; multi-sided and author-specific; politically multifarious; and insufficiently acknowledged by contemporary critics.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} study, {{the literature}} that has been produced in the territory which comprises today the South of the United States is often divided roughly into five periods: Literature of the Colonial South; Literature of the Old South (i. e., Antebellum); Postbellum Literature; the Southern Literary Renascence; and Literature After the Renascence. The division also points {{to the fact that}} "Southern Literature" can be seen {{to go back to the}} days of the colonies. The reader of the present issue of Ilha do Desterro, entitled Literature of the South of the United States, will readily notice, however, that all articles deal with <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writings</b> and authors. Initially, as guest editor, I intended to publish articles on earlier periods as well, since, as Louis Rubin and others have shown, the earlier literature contributes in concrete and fascinating ways to the development of the literary imagination and intelligence that would flower in <b>the</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> Southern Literary Renascence and later.

40|$|Good writing transcends boundaries, says Robert Franklin Gish in this {{cross-cultural}} {{inquiry into}} Anglo, American Indian, and Chicano literature. Beyond Bounds {{grew out of}} Gish 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to risk 2 ̆ 2 the disdain of advocating [...] . 2 ̆ 7 Buffalo Chip Lit 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 to test the notion that 2 ̆ 2 no one ethnicity, no one group [...] . offers the ultimate 2 ̆ 7 truth 2 ̆ 7 of tourism, seen most metaphorically as the 2 ̆ 7 tourism 2 ̆ 7 of mortality. 2 ̆ 2 Part One, 2 ̆ 2 Anglo Visitors, 2 ̆ 2 examines <b>the</b> early <b>twentieth-century</b> <b>writings</b> of Charles Lummis, Erna Ferguson, Harvey Ferguson, and Witter Bynner, visitors to New Mexico who were unabashed supporters of Anglo conquest. Yet they recognized they were newcomers to an ancient land and grew to respect the Indian and Hispano cultures. Gish finds in these Anglo writers a reverence for what D. H. Lawrence called 2 ̆ 2 {{the spirit of the}} place, 2 ̆ 2 what Charles Lummis called 2 ̆ 2 the land of poco tierripo. 2 ̆ 2 Part Two, 2 ̆ 2 Indian Voices, 2 ̆ 2 examines the novels of James Welch and the poetry of Ray A. Young Bear. Both provide insiders 2 ̆ 7 views of their unique American Indian experiences. Both affirm their Indian roots by capturing their mythic pasts. Welch 2 ̆ 7 s first novels (Winter in the Blood and The Death of Jim Loney) reveal his characters 2 ̆ 7 angst. In The Indian Lawyer he depicts an American Indian whose attempt to integrate himself into the contemporary cultural democracy of state politics ultimately leads him to find strength by seeking out the power of his cultural past. Poet Ray Young Bear asks us to listen to the cadence of his poetry as a means of remembering the ancient ways. In Part Three, 2 ̆ 2 Chicano Vistas, 2 ̆ 2 Gish returns to the then-and-now of his New Mexico roots. He examines the fiction of Rudolfo A. Anaya and the poetry of] immy Santiago Baca. With an 2 ̆ 2 epiphany of landscape 2 ̆ 2 in Bless Me, Ultima, Heart of Aztlan, and Tortuga, Anaya 2 ̆ 7 s characters are steeped in the ancient land of Aztlan in our time, drawing sustenance from the energy of the place. Among the cast of characters are La Llorona, La Curandera, and La Bruja, persona birthed in the indio-hispano synthesis of the Chicano experience, personifying a mythic heritage from which strength can be drawn. Gish draws inspiration for his work from poet Jimmy Santiago Baca who exemplifies that 2 ̆ 2 writing, at its best, transcends all borders. It collapses the borders between people and becomes gift giving. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|A major British lyric poet of {{the first}} decades of <b>the</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> was Thomas Hardy (1840-1928). Though not a modernist, Hardy was an {{important}} transitional figure between the Victorian era and <b>the</b> <b>twentieth-century.</b> A major novelist of the late nineteenth-century, Hardy lived well into the third decade of <b>the</b> <b>twentieth-century,</b> though he only published poetry in this period. Another significant transitional figure between Victorians and modernists, the late nineteenth-century novelist, Henry James (1843-1916), continued to publish major novels into <b>the</b> <b>twentieth-century,</b> including <b>The</b> Golden Bowl (1904). Polish-born modernist novelist Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) published his first important works, Heart of Darkness, in 1899 and Lord Jim in 1900. However, the Victorian Gerard Manley Hopkins's (1844-89) highly original poetry was not published until 1918, long after his death, while the career of another major modernist poet, Irishman W. B. Yeats (1865-1939), began late in the Victorian era. Yeats was one of the foremost figures of twentieth-century English literature.|$|R
