40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology.

40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this paper}} {{is the relationship between}} European modernist <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> self-fashioning and the representation of Sub-Saharan African cultures, spaces and cross-cultural encounters in the early 20 th century. The premise is that the cultural production of identity, including the question of artistic identity and poetics, is most productive where it is most ambivalent and uneasy. High modernist critical narratives pose the question of the phenomenology of travel in terms of textual authority. Authority, in the perception in late colonial European writing, was often simultaneously questioned and affirmed, meaning that Western art, and the modern society, were seen as lacking something significant outside of its margin. At the same time, the idea of the pure exotic emerged as incompatible with modern historical consciousness, and colonial texts anticipate many later theoretical ideas in postcolonial studies. The question is how to portray cross-cultural encounters, and how to fashion the self in the contact zone of travel and sojourn. Modernist travel writing asks what was the writer s self and the recognition of identity and difference in others. The modernist image of Africa carries important implications for the re-evaluation of art and literature and the renewal of artistic or narrative forms. ...|$|R

Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

40|$|A {{floating}} bridge is a structure carrying traffic across {{a body of}} water and whose supports floats on the surface. The history of the {{floating bridge}} goes as far back as around 2000 BCE, when their use was mainly military. Today, several large floating pontoon bridges help relieve traffic in and out of large cities and populated areas. In Norway, the National Public Road Administration (NPRA) have made plans to build floating bridges across two large fjords to replace the ferries that currently ship traffic across. One of these fjords is Bjørnafjorden, for which the NPRA {{have come up with a}} few different concept solutions for crossing. One of these concepts was chosen for this study to look closer at static and dynamic responses. The model of the concept bridge was created in ANSYS 17. 1, and several different analyses were performed; modal, static, regular wave and irregular sea state for three storm conditions. The main aim was to determine the dynamic response of the bridge in waves, to ensure <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> safety and comfort even during certain storm conditions. Criteria included limitations to maximum accelerations in y- and z-direction, and maximum rotations about the x-axis. The modal analysis showed that some vertical and horizontal eigenfrequencies of the bridge may coincide with environmental loads and could potentially be of concern. The static analyses with environmental and traffic loads showed that the bridge would remain structurally safe for maximum traffic and winds and currents with a 100 -year return period. Of some concern were the responses to the regular wave analyses, as the results showed little coherency and were larger than expected. The reason for this was somewhat unclear, and the responses to regular waves should be studied further. The results from the irregular sea states were more consistent and showed that the bridge would be safe for traffic during storms with a 1 -year return period. For more severe storms with return periods of 10 and 100 years the extreme responses exceeded the criteria limits, and would therefore not be deemed safe for traffic. This was not considered to be of concern, however, as the NPRA for safety reasons close bridges when wind speeds exceed 25 m/s, which they are likely to do during these storms...|$|R
40|$|In Finland, {{the annual}} number of {{reported}} Salmonella infections has been approximately 2, 000 - 3, 000 {{during the past}} 10 years. The {{vast majority of the}} infections has been acquired abroad. Nowadays salmonellosis is the second most reported cause of gastroenteritis in Finland. All Salmonella infections are included in generally hazardous communicable diseases. This register-based study aims to find out the trends of Salmonella infections that are most likely contracted from abroad, but detected in Finland during 1995 - 2009, and to examine how these trends are correlated with the number of Finnish travellers to these destinations. All the registered 30, 977 Salmonella cases of foreign origin during 1995 - 2009 were received from the National Infectious Diseases Register. Passenger information was extracted from the public data of Statistics Finland. The analyses targeted countries that had been at least once among the ten most frequently reported source countries for salmonellosis during the follow-up period. The vast majority of the Salmonella infections was detected among Finnish citizens (95. 0 %). More female (54. 4 %) than male cases were reported (p <. 001). The mean age of the persons with registered salmonellosis of foreign origin (37. 7 yrs) was not essentially changed during the study period, but, instead, reports on children (< 20 yrs) with Salmonella infection increased {{at the end of the}} study. Thailand, Spain and Turkey were the most frequently reported source countries. The overall risk of travel-related salmonellosis was 31. 8 / 100, 000 Finnish travellers per year (including one-day cruises). The highest risk countries were Thailand (679. 8 / 100, 000 travellers to the country), Tunisia (517. 0), and India (415. 1). In general, the trends of incidences seemed to decline in almost every studied country since year 2000. However, Thailand was the only country that increased the number of Finnish passengers but had a steady or even increasing incidence trend of salmonellosis among the Finnish <b>travellers.</b> <b>S.</b> enteritidis (43. 5 %) was unambiguously the most frequently detected serotype in Finland, followed by S. typhimurium (7. 8 %), S. virchow (4. 2 %), and S. stanley (3. 7 %). The majority of some serotypes was almost solely connected with travellers to a single country: S. stanley to Thailand and S. bareilly to India.

40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, much {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of breakfast for people of all ages. Nutritionists have pointed out that persons who eat a hearty breakfast show fewer signs of mid-morning fatigue, have or develop better work habits, and do not get as hungry as those who eat little or no breakfast. Many people do not realize the importance of starting the day with a good breakfast. The 12 to 13 hour fast which the body undergoes from the evening meal until breakfast time requires the consumption of an adequate breakfast. Many poor breakfasts may be attributed to either failure {{to take the time to}} eat, or to not understanding the necessity of an adequate breakfast. Nationwide surveys report that a large number of adolescents and adults fail to receive the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of their caloric and nutrient needs at breakfast. A basic breakfast pattern has been developed to aid in planning an adequate breakfast that will supply 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the calories and other nutrients needed each day. It includes fruit, cereal and/or egg, milk, bread and butter, yet it allows for a wide variation in menus. it is economical and can be easy to prepare. A breakfast of these foods insures one of less morning fatigue and better feeling during the morning and all day long. Studies show that breakfast is the most frequently missed meal. Many of the subjects who did not eat breakfast had a total day 2 ̆ 7 s intake that was classified as poor. Eating two meals a day failed to make up for the deficiency in nutrients. Breakfast consumption shows a direct relationship to the diet score, proof of the fact omitting breakfast is a poor start for the day. At the ages when an individual needs a larger intake of calories and nutrients, many times there is an actual decrease in the intake of nutritions food. The adolescents are noted for this inverse relationship between their nutritive needs and their actual intake. Galloway and Wilcox (1954), in a Utah study of school children, found that the breakfast meal did not furnish the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the day 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories and many of the other nutrients. The noon and evening meals furnished a larger percentage of most nutrients to their diets. The number of children in the study by Galloway, et al., (1954) was somewhat limited. To obtain a better picture of Utah school children 2 ̆ 7 s breakfast habits, 799 dietary records on file in the Foods and Nutrition Laboratory and 495 records collected this school year (1956 - 57) were evaluated. The objective of the present study was to determine the adequacy of breakfasts of approximately 1, 000 school children...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused emissions allowances to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> emissions <b>allowance</b> expenditures. These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, titled Travel to the Threshold, {{presents}} a close reading of Graham Greene s The Lawless Roads (1939), {{an account of}} a journey he undertook through Mexico in 1938. Greene describes Mexico of the period as troubled with social division, poverty, political corruption and religious suppression. His description of the surrounding environment and the journey involves personal recollections of his childhood juxtaposed with subjective inner consideration and reflection in relation to various encounters in his journey. Underlying exploration of the text is consideration of his at times harsh regard toward {{the people and the}} environment in which he is traveling. Overall the thesis regards Greene s travels as both a physical expedition but mainly as a trope for psychological and metaphorical journeying in developing greater understanding of self and the world. The main focus is to explore, through an analysis of The Lawless Roads, the idea of travel as motivated by individual striving to discover more about self and the world (Why do we travel?) {{and the ways in which}} travel is physically, metaphorically or symbolically utilized as a tool for this discovery process (How do we travel?). The key critical concerns consider how preconceptions, personal views, intertextuality and social and cultural background generally, effect the way one travels and the insight that may be gained from travel. This includes: consideration of how one s view of the other, the border and the unknown effect travel experience; how reflections upon experience and upbringing influence travel choices and direction; how the concept of ethical travel impacts on these ideas; and overall, in light of these concerns, how Greene s account of his Mexican travel experience broadens the concept of what travel represents, and reflects elements of what may be gained from the travelling experience. Travel may be seen as an innate search for meaning; relentless, ongoing yearnings inherent in human consciousness for understanding and at the same time a movement from innocence to experience. From the pivotal point of the threshold, (the point representing an in-between stage of knowledge of self and the other), the traveler may expand understanding of self and the world through transition into an area of unfamiliarity. A significant portion of the theoretical consideration of Greene s account of Mexico is discussed in regard to the distinction between the concepts of sedentary and nomadic travel. Sedentary travel is considered in a negative light as inhibiting the <b>traveller</b> <b>s</b> ability to gain insight from his or her travel encounters. Such a traveller carries socially and culturally conditioned preconceptions, prejudices or values that categorize and pigeon-hole experience of the alien or the other, creating a notion of difference and distance that prevents crossing over boundaries to greater understanding of the other. Nomadic travel on the other hand may be seen as a more positive form of travel in terms of gaining insight and generating tolerance within the experience of encounter. The nomadic traveler is open to, in some senses even welcomes, difference, interaction and transformation. Nomadic openness to otherness serves to break down the preconceptions and prejudices symptomatic of social and cultural conditioning, the boundaries that in a sense cage the individual and societies generally. This interpretation suggests that Greene s journey relates to aspects of both these modes of travel...|$|R

These budgets are based on volume mixing ratio profiles measured for HCl, HF, CH 3 Cl, ClONO 2, CCl 4, CCl 2 F 2, CCl 3 F, CHClF 2, CF 4, COF 2, and SF 6, near 30 -degrees north latitude. When including realistic concentrations for species not measured by ATMOS, i. e., the source gases CH 3 CCl 3, and C 2 F 3 Cl 3 below 25 km, and the reservoirs ClO, HOCl and COFCl between 15 and 40 km (five gases actually measured by other techniques), the 30 -degrees-N zonal 1985 mean total mixing ratio of chlorine, Cl, was found to be equal to (2. 58 +/- 0. 10) ppbv (parts per billion by volume) throughout the stratosphere, with no significant decrease near the stratopause. The results for total fluorine indicate a slight, but steady, decrease of its volume mixing ratio with increasing altitude, around a mean stratospheric value of (1. 15 +/- 0. 12) ppbv. Both uncertainties correspond to one standard deviation. These mean springtime 1985 stratospheric budgets are commensurate with values reported for the tropospheric Cl and F concentrations in the early 1980 <b>s,</b> when <b>allowance</b> is made for the growth rates of their source gases at the ground and the time required for tropospheric air to be transported into the stratosphere. The results are discussed with emphasis on conservation of fluorine and chlorine and the partitioning among source, sink, and reservoir gases throughout the stratosphere. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two questions}} of consumers' motor vehicle purchase and utilization. Both {{are related to}} policy variation induced by the U. <b>S.</b> Car <b>Allowance</b> Rebate System, better known as "Cash for Clunkers. " First, we directly investigate the impact of Cash for Clunkers, which was an economic stimulus program aimed at increasing new vehicle spending by subsidizing the replacement of older vehicles. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show the increase in sales during the two month program was completely offset during the following seven to nine months, consistent with previous research. However, we also find the program's fuel efficiency restrictions induced the purchase of more fuel efficient but less expensive vehicles, thereby reducing industry revenues by three billion dollars over the entire nine to eleven month period. This highlights {{the conflict between the}} stimulus and environmental objectives of the policy. Second, we investigate a related topic. Due to the high political costs of raising the tax rate on gasoline, the United States government combats the negative externalities associated with gasoline consumption by regulating the fuel efficiency of new cars sold. However, the success of these Corporate Average Fuel Economy restrictions depends crucially on whether inducing households to drive more fuel efficient cars causes them to drive more miles, which would offset {{some or all of the}} reduction in gasoline consumption. We examine this question by applying a regression discontinuity design to exploit the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency induced among new car buyers in Texas during the Cash for Clunkers program in 2009. While new car buyers whose "clunker" was barely eligible for the subsidy drove a similar number of miles per year prior to the policy and are similar in other ways to barely ineligible new car buyers, they bought significantly more fuel efficient vehicles. However, they did not respond by driving more miles following the program. As a result, the increased fuel economy reduced gasoline consumption proportionally. This suggests that behavioral responses do not undermine the effectiveness of fuel efficiency standards...|$|R

40|$|Small firms {{often have}} {{inadequate}} {{access to the}} capital necessary for sucessful management. The Swedish Government introduced in the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> rules that facilitate retention of profit for sole proprietorships and partnership firms. The tax credits arising from the allowances give certain benefits {{as a source of}} financing compared to traditional forms of credits. Among the more essential benefits are that the payment for some parts of the tax credit can be put on hold almost indefinitely, or alternatively never be paid. The firms are free to use these means, and the responsibility of future payment of the postponed tax debt stays with the individual firms. The comprehensive purpose of the dissertation may be stated as to increase the understanding of small Swedish firms, especially sole proprietorships, utilizing possibilities for allowances for income smoothing and internal financing. At the beginning the dissertation describes case studies, comprising a smaller selection of microfirms. With a starting-point from the accounted and reported income-tax returns, alternative calculations are made where additional positive tax and finance effects appear possible to obtain. One purpose of these studies is to increase the insight regarding the possibilities of income smoothing and internal financing that arise from utilizing these allowances. These studies also illuminate, to what extent and in what way they are being used in reality. Another objective of these studies is to give a more substantive insight into the technics behind the different allowances, appropriation to positive or negative interest rate allocation appropriation or dissolving of tax allocation reserve appropriation or dissolving of “expansion fund” Theories regarding the creation of resources, through building of capital, and theories on financial planning and strategy are studied. The purpose is to find support for the choice of theoretical grounded underlying independent variables {{that can be used in}} cross-sectional studies to explain the use of the possibilities of appropriations. Theories of finance that are of greatest interest, in the operationalisation of these variables, are theories that discuss the choices of different financing alternatives for small firms. The “pecking order theory”, describes the firm’s order of priority when choices of finance alternatives are made. The concept of “financial bootstrapping” expands the frame for different forms of financing choices that especially very small firms have at their disposal. The last part of the theoretical frame deals with the phenomenon of “income smoothing,” which can be translated as leveling out profits/losses. A number of financial and non-financial variables are supported by and operationalised from these financial theories e. g., return on sales, capital turnover, quick ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, respectively age, gender and line of business. Cross-sectional studies are implemented for the taxation years of 1996 and 1999, on databases that have been extracted from Statistics Sweden. The group of 87, 276 sole proprietorships included in the study were required to complete tax returns and pay taxes for the business activity according to the supporting schedule, N 2, information from the sole proprietorships’ income statement and balance sheet in an accounting statement that comes with the income tax return form. The possibilities of allowances are considered as dependent variables. The intention of the cross-sectional studies is to survey and describe the utilization of possible allowances, with the support of the financial and non-financial independent variables. The connection of these variables to the decision of sole proprietorships to appropriate to the tax allocation reserve is also summarized in a logistic regression model. A number of theoretically based propositions are made for the purpose of observing how the variables are connected to the chances that sole proprietorships actually appropriate to this form of allowance. Appropriation to the tax allocation reserve stands out as the most practiced form of allowance. The studies also clarify that utilization varies among different forms of allowances, but that not all firms that have the prerequisites to utilize the possibilities really do so to the full. A further utilization of the different possibilities of allowances is often conceivable. For the sole proprietorships that are not utilizing these possibilities, the allowances should be considered eligible as a contribution to internal financing and to increase access to capital...|$|R

Agrimoniae herba, Betulae folium, Bursae pastoris herba, Foenigraeci semen, Galegae herba, Maydis stigma, Taraxaci radix, Phaseoli fructus sine seminibus, Urticae folium, and their teas were analysed by ICP-OES for element content. Concentration of the elements of crude drug samples obtained are in good agreement with the average concentrations of plants, although some significantly high concentration has been found for manganese (893 mg kg- 1), zinc (275 mg kg- 1) and iron (492 mg kg- 1) in Betulae folium, for copper (41. 2 mg kg- 1) in Galegae herba, for iron (2692 mg kg- 1) in Taraxaci radix, for calcium (41210 mg kg- 1) and magnesium (6275 mg kg- 1) in Urticae folium. The common characteristic feature of crude drugs is the relatively high concentration of chromium (0. 8 - 16. 3 mg kg- 1). Ion concentrations of teas are relatively low. The quantities of metal ions do not cover the daily needs, nevertheless, they may be important as food supplements. According to U. <b>S.</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances</b> (RDA), the following teas are good sources: Agrimoniae herba for chromium, Betulae folium for manganese, Taraxaci radix for copper and chromium, Urticae folium for potassium and calcium.

40|$|Oral {{intake of}} ascorbic acid is {{essential}} for optimum health in human beings. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have an increased need for ascorbic acid, because of increased loss through dialysate, reduced intake owing to nausea and loss of appetite, and increased oxidative stress. However, optimum intake is still controversial. We studied 50 clinically stable patients to determine the relationship between oral ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid (SAA) level. Total oral intake ranged from 28 mg daily to 412 mg daily. Only one patient had an oral intake of ascorbic acid below 60 mg per day. The SAA levels ranged from 1 mg/L to 36. 17 mg/L. Although a strong correlation existed between intake and SAA (p < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 47), the variation in SAA at any given intake level was wide. Of the studied patients, 62 % had an SAA < 8. 7 mg/L, 40 % had an SAA < 5. 1 mg/L (below the level in a healthy population), and 12 % had a level below 2 mg/L (scorbutic). None of the patients demonstrated clinical manifestations of scurvy. Our results show that, in CAPD patients, ascorbic acid deficiency can be reliably detected only with SAA measurements, and oral intake may influence SAA level. To maintain ascorbic acid in the normal range for healthy adults, daily oral intake needs to be increased above the U. <b>S.</b> recommended dietary <b>allowance</b> to 80 - 140 mg...|$|R

The behaviour of dissolution of mineral elements into different tinctures and aqueous extracts obtained from Solidaginis herba was investigated in connection with their quercetin glycoside and organic acid amount. Commonly applied aqueous and alcoholic extracts were analysed for Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Ti, V and Zn content. The concentrations of the minerals examined were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Determination of the flavonoids in solidaginis herba and extracts was carried out by a spectrophotometric method, as required by the German Pharmacopoea. For the study of the flavonoid composition of crude drug, the HPLC technique was applied. To determine the relative nutrient contribution of these pharmaceuticals to the diet, data obtained were combined with flavonoid content particulars, then a comparison with U. <b>S</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances</b> (RDA) was made. For evaluation of the phytotherapeutic relevance, k/Na ratio was also calculated. It has been found that the pharmaceuticals examined are important sources of potassium, chromium, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and lower sources of iron and zinc, assuming a daily intake of 1 - 2 l aqueous extracts as recommended for urological diseases. Flavonoid content of the different Solidaginis herba extracts ranged from 62. 4 mg l- 1 to 305. 2 mg l- 1...|$|R
