50|$|The machine had {{a simple}} task to perform. Essentially, the {{requirement}} was {{to cut a}} trench with a section of about six feet (2 m) square and for this some sort of cutter was required.

The key feature of such machines was that the cutting was a continuous process that required a fairly constant power and from this comparison the <b>trenching</b> <b>machine</b> power requirement was estimated at about 1,000 hp half of which was for cutting and half for driving the machine forward.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1940, came a huge surprise: {{someone else}} had invented a high speed <b>trenching</b> <b>machine</b> envisaged {{to be used in}} a similar way but working by quite {{different}} means.

Clarke had prepared a paper [...] "A Consideration of New Offensive Means" [...] and followed this with [...] "Notes on Design of Trench Forming Machines" [...] for the Royal Engineers. His ideas filtered through the wartime bureaucracy and eventually reached the Cultivator project team. Clarke was interviewed by Churchill's scientific advisor, Professor Lindemann. In strict confidence, Lindemann told Clarke about work already in progress and he was sufficiently impressed to pass Clarke's suggestions up to Churchill himself. Clarke accepted a job as a temporary Civil Servant; he was hired as an Assistant Director of NLE with a salary of £1,000 per annum.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to assess the ease of excavability prior to and during trenching operations. The project partners were EnTech Engineering Inc., Vermeer Manufacturing Co., and AlliedSignal Federal Manufacturing & Technology (FM&T) /Kansas City Plant (KCP). Commercial GPRs were field tested as well as a system developed at AlliedSignal FM&T. The AlliedSignal GPR was centered around a HP 8753 Network Analyzer instrument. Commercial GPR antennas were connected to the analyzer and data was collected under control of software written for a notebook PC. Images of sub-surface features were generated for varied system parameters including: frequency, bandwidth, FFT windowing, gain, antenna orientation, and surface roughness conditions. Depths to 10 feet were of primary interest in this project. Although further development is required, this project has demonstrated that GPR can be used to identify transitions between different sub-surface conditions, as in going from one rock type to another. Additionally, the average relative dielectric constant of the material can be estimated which can be used to help identify the material. This information can be used to characterize an excavation site for use in budgeting a job. A real-time GPR would provide the operator with sub-surface images that could help with setting the optimum feed and speed rates of the <b>trenching</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{dredging}} activities submerged jets {{are widely}} used for different purposes. Two main applications are considered in this study: 1) a jetting sword on a cable trencher and 2) jets located on a draghead. Both jetting systems are especially designed for jetting sands and achieving large excavation productions in sandy soils. However when cohesive soils have to be jetted, the production decreases drastically. In sandy soils the jet creates wide cavities, while the cavity width produced by a jet in cohesive soils like clay is very narrow. Different researchers found that the cavity depth decreases only a little by an increasing traversing velocity of the nozzle and the cavity width to remain more or less constant, i. e. the jet can process more clay than generally is supplied. This results {{in the fact that}} the highest production will be achieved at the highest traversing velocities. However, the traversing velocity of the nozzle is limited by the tool (trencher/draghead). With the use of a rotating jet, more soil is supplied to the jet. The affected area is increased and the combined traversing velocity (normal traversing part + rotating velocity part) is increased as well. In this research the possible increase in excavation production of clay of a rotating jet compared to a conventional non-rotating jet for two purposes is studied; a rotating jet on a <b>trenching</b> <b>machine</b> and a rotating jet on a draghead. This research exists out of two models and two experimental test setups. Bothmodels consist of two modules; a calculation module and a visualization module. The calculation module predicts the excavation production as a function of: 1) Jet pressure, 2) Undrained shear strength, 3) Traversing velocity, 4) Rotational velocity, 5) Nozzle angle, 6) Nozzle diameter. The model is based on the entrainment of water at the back-side of the jet and soil at the front-side of the jet. The more entrainment of soil, the greater the increase in jet mixture density and the higher the decrease in stagnation pressure, resulting in a smaller penetration depth. The visualization module shows the cavity shape based on the cavity parameters modeled in the calculation module. The jet is modeled as a cone based on the geometry calculated in the calculated module. The jet will travel along a trajectory depending on traversing velocity and rotational velocity. The trajectory were the jet has been present, is removed and visualized as excavated volume. Two experimental test setups are developed in order to validate the models. The main parameters varied were the traversing velocity, nozzle angle (45 °/ 60 °), rotational velocity and jet pressure. For the trenching setup the increase in excavation production found, lies in a range between 6 and 7 for a traversing velocity of 15 - 215 m/h. For the draghead setup the traversing velocity was varied between 35 and 1800 m/h. The increase in excavation production can be up to a factor 4. The calculation module for the trenching application is able to produce a good estimation of the excavation production for the 45 ° nozzle. The calculation module overestimates the excavation production of the 60 ° nozzle compared to the experimental results. For the draghead application the developed model is able to give results close to the corresponding experimental results for traversing velocities lower than 1000 m/h. For larger traversing velocities the model underestimates the excavation production compared to the experimental results. The results of the experiments including the developed models can be used as a base for the design of rotating jets on a jetting sword or draghead.

50|$|The {{tactic of}} using {{overlapping}} arcs of fire came to prominence during World War I {{where it was}} a feature of <b>trench</b> warfare. <b>Machine</b> guns were placed in groups, called machine-gun nests, and they protected {{the front of the}} trenches.

25|$|<b>Trenches,</b> <b>machine</b> guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, {{and modern}} {{artillery}} with fragmentation shells helped bring {{the battle lines}} of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution {{with the creation of}} the tank and mechanised warfare. The British first tanks were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the Renault FT, which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of light automatic weapons and submachine guns, such as the Lewis Gun, the Browning automatic rifle, and the Bergmann MP18.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{agricultural}} land drainage {{started with the}} digging of relatively shallow open ditches that received both runoff from the land surface and outflow of groundwater. Hence the ditches had a surface {{as well as a}} subsurface drainage function.By the end of the 19th century and early in the 20th century it was felt that the ditches were a hindrance for the farm operations and the ditches were replaced by buried lines of clay pipes (tiles), each tile about 30 cm long. Hence the term [...] "tile drainage". Since 1960, one started using long, flexible, corrugated plastic (PVC or PE) pipes that could be installed efficiently in one go by <b>trenching</b> <b>machines.</b> The pipes could be pre-wrapped with an envelope material, like synthetic fibre and geotextile, that would prevent the entry of soil particles into the drains.
