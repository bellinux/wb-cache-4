5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> football game ever played. The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game {{would have on the}} prevalence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Important {{contributions}} {{were made}} by some prominent literary families.

Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, {{who was in the}} court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja. Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest,</b> and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E

5|$|Potemkin then {{embarked}} on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, {{as a base for}} a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with the Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was his effort to build the city of Ekaterinoslav (lit. The glory of Catherine), now Dnipropetrovsk. The second most successful city of Potemkin's rule was Nikolayev (now better known as Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was to turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} ancient writers have {{reflected}} {{on the issue of}} population.

Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered <b>the</b> latter possibility <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> evil. Chanakya favored the remarriage of widows (which at <b>the</b> time <b>was</b> forbidden in India), opposed taxes encouraging emigration, and believed in restricting asceticism to the aged.|$|R
