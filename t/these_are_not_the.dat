5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

25|$|Aphasia is an {{inability}} to comprehend and formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. This damage is typically caused by a cerebral vascular accident (stroke), or head trauma, however <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only possible causes. To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or several) of the four communication modalities following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia). The four communication modalities are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the jazz}} {{researcher}} Ekkehard Jost discerned two basic trends of the jazz scene: one, jazz as a repertoire music and two, jazz in stable and dynamic development. The latter survives through musical practice {{and is based}} on the origins of jazz. In the 1990s, even more than in the 1980s, the marketing of music styles dominated the music business, and jazz in particular. Helge Schneider, a well-known entertainer, knew how to integrate jazz into his own comedic art. Another well-known German jazz musician and entertainer is Götz Alsmann, as well as the successful trumpeter Till Brönner. A number of other jazz musicians became established through entertainment-jazz in the scene as well. However, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only musicians who work as jazz musicians sometimes under difficult conditions in Germany, and who are responsible for creating such diverse styles of jazz.|$|E

500|$|Even the {{characters}} have Virgilian counterparts, with Booth being comparable to Aeneas and Miss Mathews Fielding's version of Dido. Fielding does not {{shy away from}} such comparisons, but embraces them with {{his use of the}} line [...] "Furens quid Foemina possit" [...] (translated as [...] "what a woman can do in frenzy"), in Book IV, Chapter Five; this line is directly taken from the Aeneid. Likewise, Fielding's bailiff misstates Virgil's [...] "dolus an virtus, quis in hoste requirat" [...] (translated as [...] "whether deceit or valour, who would ask in the enemy") when he says [...] "Bolus and Virtus, quis in a Hostess equirit" [...] in Book VIII, Chapter One. However, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only quotes, and Fielding cites many passages of Latin and Greek while not providing direct translations for them.

500|$|When {{it came to}} vowel forms, Keats {{incorporated}} a pattern of alternating historically [...] "short" [...] and [...] "long" [...] vowel sounds in his ode.

This alteration is continued in longer lines, including line 31 ("Away! away! for I will fly to thee") which contains five pairs of alternations. However, other lines, such as line 3 ("Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains") rely on a pattern of five [...] "short" [...] vowels followed by [...] "long" [...] and [...] "short" [...] vowel pairings until they end with a [...] "long" [...] vowel. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only combination patterns present, and there are patterns of two [...] "short" [...] vowels followed by a [...] "long" [...] vowel in other lines, including 12, 22, and 59, which are repeated twice and then followed up with two sets of [...] "short" [...] and then [...] "long" [...] vowel pairs.
