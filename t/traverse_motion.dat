40|$|An Orbital Winch {{mechanism}} enables high-load, multi-line tethers to {{be deployed}} and retracted without rotating the spool on which the tether is wound. To minimize damage to the tether and the wound package during retraction or deployment under load, it can incorporate a Tension Management Module that reduces the infeed tension {{by a factor of}} 15 {{through the use of a}} powered capstan with guide rollers. This design eliminates the need for rotating high-voltage electrical connections in tether systems that use propellantless electro-dynamic propulsion. It can also eliminate the need for rotating optical connections in applications where the tether contains optical fibers. This winch design was developed to deploy a 15 -km-long, 15 -kg high-strength Hoytether structure incorporating conductive wires as part of the MXER- 1 demonstration mission concept. Two slewing rings that orbit around the tether spool, combined with translation of one of the slewing rings back and forth along the spool axis to traverse the wind point, enables the winch to wind the tether. Variations of the <b>traverse</b> <b>motion</b> of the slewing ring can accomplish level winds and conical pirn winds. By removing the non-traversing slewing ring, and adding an actuated guide arm, the winch can manage rapid, low-drag deployment of a tether off the end of a pirn-wound spool, followed by controlled retraction and rewinding, in a manner very similar to a spin-casting reel. The winch requires at least two motor driver controller units to coordinate the action of two stepper motors to accomplish tether deployment or retraction...|$|E

40|$|The final project {{highlights}} {{a method}} for controlling a haptic crane and hoist model based on an Active Force Control (AFC) strategy. It is a disturbance rejection control technique in which AFC is employed to control accurately and robustly the trolley part of the crane along a desired path, compensating {{at the same time}} the payload sway at the end of the <b>traversed</b> <b>motion.</b> AFC is designed and implemented using a two degree-of-freedom controller-the outer classic Proportional-Integral- Derivative (PID) control loop provides the commanded signal while the internal AFC loop accommodates the known and unknown disturbances present in the crane and hoist system. Results from the simulation clearly show that the crane can perform its predefined task faster with a minimum payload sway angle compared to the PID control method. Result from experiment on the plant is difficult to differentiate which control method is better since both of them show the same swing angle and time to reach the reference position. This is due to the pulse generated by the microcontroller is the same between two controllers, but AFC control shows better result in accuracy of reaching the reference position with smaller error than PID control.

The approach detects actions {{in an online}} manner, meaning the action recognition takes place as the <b>motion</b> <b>traverses</b> from beginning to end, signalling if an action has ended at the currently processed frame. The method is evaluated using various motion capture databases and query motions ranging from optical motion capture data to skeleton data obtained from a depth camera.

40|$|Real-time {{animation}} of human-like characters is {{an active}} research area in computer graphics. The conventional approaches have, however, hardly dealt with the rhythmic patterns of motions, which are essential in handling rhythmic motions such as dancing and locomotive motions. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for synthesizing a new motion from unlabelled example motions while preserving their rhythmic pattern. Our scheme first captures the motion beats from the example motions to extract the basic movements and their transitions. Based on those data, our scheme then constructs a movement transition graph that represents the example motions. Given an input sound signal, our scheme finally synthesizes a novel motion in an on-line manner while <b>traversing</b> the <b>motion</b> transition graph, which is synchronized with the input sound signal and also satisfies kinematic constraints given explicitly and implicitly. Through experiments, we have demonstrated that our scheme can effectively produce a variety of rhythmic motions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new fuzzy anti-swing {{control scheme}} is {{proposed}} for a three-dimensional overhead crane. The proposed control {{consists of a}} position servo con-trol and a fuzzy-logic control. The position servo control is used to control crane position and rope length, and the fuzzy-logic control is used to suppress load swing. The proposed control guarantees accu-rate control of crane position and rope length as well as prompt suppression of load swing for simultaneous travel, <b>traverse,</b> and hoisting <b>motions</b> of the crane. Furthermore, the proposed control provides practical gain tuning criteria for easy implementation. The ef-fectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated by experiments with a three-dimensional prototype overhead crane. ...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the motion}} capture data used in animations, commercials, and video games is {{carefully}} segmented into distinct motions either {{at the time of}} capture or by hand after the capture session. As we move toward collecting more and longer motion sequences, however, automatic segmentation techniques will become important for processing the results in a reasonable time frame. We have found that straightforward, easy to implement segmentation techniques can be very effective for segmenting motion sequences into distinct behaviors. In this paper, we present three approaches for automatic segmentation. The first two approaches are online, meaning that the algorithm <b>traverses</b> the <b>motion</b> from beginning to end, creating the segmentation as it proceeds. The first assigns a cut when the intrinsic dimensionality of a local model {{of the motion}} suddenly increases. The second places a cut when the distribution of poses is observed to change. The third approach is a batch process and segments the sequence where consecutive frames belong to different elements of a Gaussian mixture model. We assess these three methods on fourteen motion sequences and compare the performance of the automatic methods to that of transitions selected manually. Key words: human motion, motion capture, motion segmentation, PCA...|$|R
40|$|Maps. The {{problem of}} goal-directed, collision-free motion in a complex, {{unpredictable}} environment {{can be solved}} by tightly integrating high-level deliberative planning with low-level reactive con-trol. This thesis presents two such architectures for a nonholonomic mobile robot. To achieve real-time performance, reactive control capabilities have to be fully realized so that the deliber-ative planner can be simplified. These architectures are enriched with reactive target reaching and obstacle avoidance modules. Their target reaching modules use indirect-mapping Extended Kohonen Map to provide finer and smoother motion control than direct-mapping methods. While one architecture fuses these modules indirectly via command fusion, the other one couples them directly using cooperative Extended Kohonen Maps, enabling the robot to negotiate unforeseen concave obstacles. The planner for both architectures use a slippery cells technique to decompose the free workspace into fewer cells, thus reducing search time. Any two points in the cell can still be <b>traversed</b> by reactive <b>motion...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the model-based {{design of a}} fork control system in a turret head operated Very Narrow Aisle forklift in order to evaluate and push {{the limits of the}} current hardware architecture. The turret head movement consists of two separate <b>motions,</b> <b>traversing</b> and rotation, which both are hydraulically actuated. The plant is thoroughly modeled in the Mathworks softwares Simulink/Simscape to assist {{in the design of the}} control system. The control system is designed in Simulink/Stateflow and code-generated to be evaluated in the actual forklift. Optimal control theory is used to generate a minimum-jerk trajectory for auto-rotation, that is simultaneous traversing and rotation with the load kept in centre. The new control system is able to control the system within the positioning requirements of +/- 10 mm and +/- 9 mrad for traversing and rotation, respectively. It also shows good overall performance in terms of robustness since it has been tested and validated with different loads and on different versions of the forklift. However, the study also shows that the non-linearities of the system, especially in the hydraulic proportional valves, causes problems in a closed-loop control system. The work serves as a proof of concept for model-based development at the company since the development time of the new control system was significantly lower than for the original control system...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{simulation}} {{and experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that some grain boundaries (GBs) can couple to applied shear stresses and be moved by them, producing shear deformation of the lattice <b>traversed</b> by their <b>motion.</b> While this coupling effect has been well confirmed for symmetrical tilt GBs, {{little is known about the}} coupling ability of asymmetrical boundaries. In this work we apply a combination of molecular dynamics and phase field crystal simulations to investigate stress-driven motion of asymmetrical GBs between cubic crystals over the entire range of inclination angles. Our main findings are that the coupling effect exists for most of the asymmetrical GBs and that the coupling factor exhibits a non-trivial dependence on both the misorientation and inclination angles. This dependence is characterized by a discontinuous change of sign of the coupling factor, which reflects a transition between two different coupling modes over a narrow range of angles. Importantly, the magnitude of the coupling factor becomes large or divergent within this transition region, thereby giving rise to a sliding-like behavior. Our results are interpreted in terms of a diagram presenting the domains of existence of the two coupling modes and the transition region between them in the plane of misorientation and inclination angles. The simulations reveal some of the dislocation mechanisms responsible for the motion of asymmetrical tilt GBs. The results of this study compare favorably with existing experimental measurements and provide a theoretical ground for the design of future experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{direction of}} a motion step (probe stimulus) can be influenced by an earlier motion step or a brief motion sweep containing {{a series of steps}} (biasing stimulus). Depending upon experimental conditions, the biasing of the direction of the probe step (a phase shift of 180 Â°Â±Î¦) by a biasing stimulus which precedes it by approximately 250 ms can either increase (positive filter biasing) or decrease (negative filter biasing) the tendency to see the probe move in the biasing direction as computed with a motion filter with a biphasic temporal impulse response. In a series of experiments it was found that biasing <b>motions</b> <b>traversing</b> 90 Â° of phase angle in fewer than six steps in less than 100 ms produced positive filter biasing. Also, biasing of the probe direction could be dissociated from the consciously reported direction of the biasing stimulus, and it did not occur when the probe preceded rather than followed the biasing stimulus. A biasing sweep containing more than six steps traversing 90 Â° or a sweep traversing 270 Â° produced negative filter biasing. Perceptual fusion of the steps of the sweep was not a necessary condition for obtaining negative filter biasing. In general, the negative filter biasing effects were found to be the most pervasive for the conditions investigated, and they are suggestive of a direction-specific, adaptation-like (gain-control) process in first-order motion filters. The exception to the negative biasing rule was found only with biasing stimuli which were short in duration or distance spanned...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{processes}} {{powered by}} thermal energy lead to protein <b>motions</b> <b>traversing</b> time-scales from picoseconds to seconds. Fundamental to protein functionality is {{the utilization of}} these dynamics for tasks such as catalysis, folding, and allostery. A hierarchy of motion is hypothesized to connect and synergize fast and slow dynamics toward performing these essential activities. Population shuffling predicts a top-down temporal hierarchy, where slow time-scale conformational interconversion leads to a shuffling of the free energy landscape for fast time-scale events. Until now, population shuffling was only applied to interconverting ground states. Here, we extend the framework of population shuffling to be applicable for a system interconverting between low energy ground and high energy excited states, such as the SH 3 domain mutants G 48 M and A 39 V/N 53 P/V 55 L from the Fyn tyrosine kinase, providing another tool for accessing the structural dynamics of high energy excited states. Our {{results indicate that the}} higher energy gauche- rotameric state for the leucine (2) dihedral angle contributes significantly to the distribution of rotameric states in both the major and minor forms of the SH 3 domain. These findings are corroborated with unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on both the major and minor states of the SH 3 domain demonstrating high correlations between experimental and back-calculated leucine (2) rotameric populations. Taken together, we demonstrate how fast time-scale rotameric side-chain population distributions can be extracted from slow time-scale conformational exchange data further extending the scope and the applicability of the population shuffling model...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The {{subject of}} this study is quality of motion in tonal music as viewed from the {{structural}} perspective of Schenkerian tonal theory. The Schenkerian concept of composing-out is identified as the primary basis of quality of motion. Thus a progression displays a sense of "purposeful" motion as it composes-out, or traverses, a harmonic interval. As the composing-out is furthered through the application of prolongation, other kinds of qualities arise in the progressions that are generated. Each of the generated progressions is heard not just as a <b>motion</b> <b>traversing</b> its own intervallic space, but also as a delay of, or detour from, the motion of the original progression. The generated progression may also be heard as directed toward or away from the original progression: for example, an initial ascent is heard as directed toward the fundamental line, a circumstance which seems to energize the quality of the ascent in a special way. Such qualities as this that are born of a relation to higher structure are referred to in this study as inflections. Specific Schenkerian prolongational techniques in both upper voice and bass are reviewed, including initial ascent, motion from the inner voice, reaching-over, complete and incomplete transference of the forms of the fundamental structure, motion to the applied divider, and auxiliary cadence. One chapter is given over in its entirety to a discussion of structural division and interruption. In all cases, the principle of tonal unity as embodied in composing-out is seen to lead to clear distinctions in quality of motion. Two negative examples are considered in the final chapter, where ambiguity of quality of motion is shown to be symptomatic of a breakdown of tonal unity...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis, a flow {{visualization}} {{experiment and}} a blade tracking experiment have been conducted. The {{aim of the}} thesis has been to assess {{the performance of the}} new blade tow tank rig at the Fluid Mechanics Lab at NTNU. The blade tracking experiment involved reconstructing the trajectory of the blade and analyzing the blade's vibrations. The flow visualization experiment involved analyzing the tip vortices produced {{in the wake of the}} blade. This experiment is conducted by injecting dye into the tank near the tip of the blade. A LabVIEW program has been created to accurately control the blade in the tank, through sending signals to the two stepper motors controlling the <b>traversing</b> and rotational <b>motion</b> of the blade. The program is designed to allow the user to quickly pick a specific velocity and acceleration of the blade, and thus a specific tip speed ratio (Î»). The blade tracking experiment was able to accurately reconstruct the trajectory of the blade. It also yielded some interesting results regarding the error associated with camera focus (depth of field). The results were, however, inconclusive regarding the nature of the blade vibrations. The flow visualization experiment produced images of the tip vortices at different values of Î». The expected result that is increasing Î» decreases the strength of the tip vortices was also found, by comparing the change in intensity for the different scenarios. The overall result of confirming the usability of the rig is important, because it opens up the possibility for many future research projects. By creating procedures for creating tip vortices as well as analyzing the trajectory of the blade, this thesis might prove to be an important step in much research in the years to come. Since the strength of the tip vortices is closely linked to the wake recovery length, the results from this thesis further proves the potential for improving wind farm efficiency. The results also proved the importance of high-quality imagery, as it turned out the cameras' frame rate and depth of field proved detrimental to the result of the blade tracking experiment...|$|R
