50|$|Through rather laughable {{cinematography}} (contributing to the memorability {{and popularity}} of this event), {{it is made}} to seem as if the diminutive New World monkey is a savage beast.

Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object.

5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
5|$|According to the JNA, the Bosnian Croat TO {{attacked}} {{in the morning}} of 3 April, reached the village of Donji Malovan and blockaded the Kupreška Vrata Tunnel by 7:30a.m. The village was captured by Croats after three hours of combat, and the fighting shifted towards the village of Gornji Malovan and Kupres. By the end of the day, the Bosnian Serb TO force in Gornji Malovan was besieged. The JNA instructed the Yugoslav Air Force to attack after it received reports that 15 HV tanks had appeared on the battlefield. The 30th Partisan Division staff amended the plans formulated the previous day and advanced with elements of the 11th Motorised Brigade towards Kupres via Zlosela, against positions held by the Kupres Battalion at 1:15p.m. The change of plans enabled elements of the 13th Partisan Brigade <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them by 6:00p.m. and caused the attack to fail.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its competitors.|$|E
5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would come out on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Junpei and {{the others}} reach the incinerator; Akane disappears and Santa escapes with Ace hostage, {{trapping}} the others inside. It is then revealed that {{the portion of the}} game's narrative portrayed on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS is presented from a 12-year-old Akane's point of view during the first Nonary Game. Through morphic fields, she connected to Junpei in the future, witnessing several possible realities and directing Junpei to help him survive. Junpei then faces the same sudoku puzzle Akane did, and relays the solution back to Akane in the past, allowing her to escape with Seven and the other children. Junpei realizes that Akane was Zero and, with assistance from Santa, had recreated the game and all the events she had witnessed in order to ensure her survival and avoid a temporal paradox. As Junpei {{and the others}} escape, they discover that the game had taken place in Building Q the entire time, and that Akane and Santa have fled, leaving behind a car with Ace restrained in the trunk. In the game's epilogue, they drive away hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them and, shortly after, pick up a hitchhiker whom Junpei recognizes as Alice.|$|E
40|$|When people attend {{meetings}} {{they may}} miss {{parts of the}} discussion if they, for example, step out to take a phone call, go to the bathroom, or have a momentary lapse in concentration. As a result, they may need <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> on what they missed upon returning to the meeting. Asking other attendees for a recap is often disruptive. To avoid such disruptions, we have developed an Accelerated Instant Replay (AIR) Conferencing system for videoconferencing that enables participants <b>to</b> privately <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an ongoing meeting. We explored several mechanisms where the meeting content is replayed at an accelerated rate so that the participants can <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the live discussion reasonably quickly...|$|R

Conditions under which the less efficient firm is able <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> or <b>to</b> surpass the technology of the advanced firm have been derived. The implications of removing the endogeneity of this decision of the less efficient firms are also examined. ...|$|R

Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Robinson was {{commissioned}} {{chief of the}} Bureau of Engineering (BuEng) with the rank of rear admiral, succeeding Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. During this first of two nonconsecutive terms as the chief Navy engineer, Robinson helped stimulate the development of submarine electric propulsion. At the time, lightweight, high-speed engines {{were still in the}} experimental phase and no existing engine was suitable for submarine electric drive. Procuring such an engine was a venture requiring a level of risk and capital investment that was considered prohibitive for a private company. Rather than wait for the private sector <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Navy's requirements, Robinson launched an innovative bureau-sponsored competition that successfully drew private diesel contractors into the submarine propulsion market.|$|E
