25|$|The oldest extant {{literary}} {{text in the}} Maltese {{language is}} Pietru Caxaro's poem, Cantilena (circa 1470 to 1485) (also known as Xidew il-Qada), followed by Gian Francesco Bonamico's sonnet of praise to Grand Master Nicolò Cotoner, Mejju gie' bl'Uard, u Zahar (The month of May has arrived, with roses and orange blossoms), circa 1672. The earliest known Maltese dictionary was written by Francois de Vion Thezan Court (circa 1640). In 1700, an anonymous Gozitan poet wrote Jaħasra Mingħajr Ħtija (Unfortunately Innocent). A Maltese translation of the Lord's Prayer appeared in Johannes Heinrich Maius's work Specimen Lingua Punicæ in hodierna Melitensium superstitis (1718). A collection of religious sermons by a certain Dun Ignazio Saverio Mifsud, published between 1739 and 1746, is now regarded as the earliest known Maltese prose. An anonymous poem entitled Fuqek Nitħaddet Malta (I am <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> Malta), was written circa 1749, regarding the uprising of the slaves of that year. A few years later, in 1752, a catechism entitled Tagħlim Nisrani ta' Dun Franġisk Wizzino (Don Francesco Wizzino's Christian Teachings) was published in both Maltese and Italian. The occasion of Carnival in 1760 saw {{the publication of a}} collection of burlesque verses under the heading Żwieġ la Maltija (Marriage, in the Maltese Style), by Dun Feliċ Demarco.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the album}} was titled Five Against One (The song [...] "Animal" [...] {{features}} the lyric [...] "One, two, three, four, five against one..."). Concerning the original album title, Gossard said, [...] "For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through {{trying to make a}} record... Your own independence—your own soul—versus everybody else's." [...] The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to Vs., a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title Vs., Vedder said, [...] "They were writing all these articles... Our band against somebody else's band. What the hell are they <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>You</b> know, don't try to separate the powers that be. We're all in this together." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rose {{described}} {{the writing process}} for the album as [...] "a more personal experience to him", and said that due to the events that transpired in the prior year, he would sometimes have trouble coming up with words, and would often write gibberish as a temporary filler. While Rose would be the primary writer, all {{five members of the}} band would contribute. Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we like to leave it up to the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing line you wrote,' and he went, 'What are you <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>You</b> wrote that.' We wanted to change the template completely from what we did with our last album, 'Hope And Sorrow'. We were going, 'Let's bring back those other elements Clint brought in that made us what we were.' So we sort of made a silent agreement {{that we were going to}} let Clint run wild. We said we'll jump in when it's time, but if you've got an idea let's go with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was shot with Anthony Mandler, {{director}} of the [...] "Over" [...] video in Kingston, Jamaica {{during the week of}} April 12, 2010, exclusively revealed to Rap-Up. Drake told MTV News, [...] "We went to Kingston, We went to this 'hood. They call it the 'gully' side. It's bad out there, real bad. They had 'Young Money' sprayed on the gates, 'Drake and Wayne,' 'cause I came to shoot the video out there. I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> drive by people's homes, they had 'Drake,' 'Young Money,' 'Drake, Welcome Here,' 'Drake We Love You' — crazy sh--, man. It was so crazy. This dude was like, 'Original Weezy tha God! You tha boss! Weezy tha God!' It's crazy. They love us, 'cause we show love out there." [...] The video was released on May 11, 2010, on Drake's blog and on MTV. In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's kind of like the anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene. It's about really understanding what's right and what's wrong and it's really easy to lose that when you're the center of attention. He did it fearlessly, he did it without any sign of hesitation. He wanted to do something that went further with the song, that took the essence of the song but communicated it with imagery that made people think, rather than go up the middle and make an obvious R video." ...|$|E
