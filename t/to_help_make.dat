It included representatives from free-to-air broadcasters, manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers and was intended to provide information about commencement dates, coverage, and the functionality and availability of equipment.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007–08 season, the Avalanche signed {{two free}} agents: defenseman Scott Hannan and left winger Ryan Smyth. These {{acquisitions}} filled the team's needs and were expected <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> {{an impact in}} the playoffs. With a 9–5 victory over the St. Louis Blues on December 9, 2007, the Avalanche earned their 1,000th franchise victory. On February 25, 2008, unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with the Avalanche {{for the remainder of}} the 2007–08 season. A day later, at the trade deadline, they re-acquired popular defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the Western Conference Semi-finals, however, the Avalanche were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E
5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E

5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> {{public the}} government's exact spraying practices {{and the related}} research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} undertook {{its last}} major {{action of the}} war {{at the end of}} September 1918 when, serving alongside the Americans, they breached parts of the Hindenburg Line along the St Quentin Canal. During this final battle, the battalion's long serving commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henderson, who had taken command in February 1917 before the battalion's first major battle, was killed in action. Late on 2 October, while around Gillemont Crescent, the 39th was relieved and the battalion was removed from the line to undertake training and reorganisation. In the middle of October, the 39th was bolstered by a company of reinforcements from the 37th, which had been disbanded <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>make</b> up losses in the other 10th Brigade units. Nevertheless, the 39th did not see action again and they were still at the rear when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. With the fighting over, the process of demobilisation began and slowly the men began marching out for repatriation to Australia. Finally, in March 1919, the 39th Battalion was disbanded. At this point, the battalion's remaining personnel were amalgamated with other units to form the 10th Demobilisation Regiment, with the last of its soldiers returning to Australia in May.|$|E
