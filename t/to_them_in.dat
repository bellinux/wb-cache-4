5|$|Early in his career, Öhlund was {{selected}} to play in three World Junior Championships for Sweden.

As the medals were determined by a round-robin format, Sweden fell one point short of Canada, losing 6–4 <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> their final and deciding game. After a bronze medal in 1995, Öhlund returned for a third straight World Junior tournament in 1996 to record five assists and was named the tournament's Best Defenceman. He was additionally named to the Tournament All-Star Team as he captured his second World Junior silver medal.|$|E

5|$|In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from Old Norse Askr ok Embla)—male {{and female}} respectively—were {{the first two}} humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, {{one of whom is}} Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> popular culture.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{this manner}} that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic Doctrine in 1949.|$|E

The administration of each kingdom was {{very similar to that}} of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.|$|E

The New Zealand and Australian Division normally also had two mounted brigades assigned to it, but these had been left in Egypt, as it was believed there would be no requirement or opportunities to use mounted troops on the peninsula. To bring the division up to strength, Hamilton had tried unsuccessfully to get a brigade of Gurkhas attached <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> total ANZAC strength was 30,638 men.|$|E

5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, {{although it is}} difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E

5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending {{them out to the}} frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E

When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half.
