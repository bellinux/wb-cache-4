Cobalt and Copper sulfides nanoparticles are high interest for absorbers of solar thermal collectors due to their optical properties and high absorptance in the solar wavelength range (> 96 %).

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A study of thermal, structural, electrical and optical characteristics of molybdenum black surface coatings on various substrates has been made. The suitability of these coatings for use as selective absorbers for solar collector applications has been assessed. Molybdenum black (Mo black) coatings were prepared by electrodeposition (on aluminium) and a chemcial conversion method (on zinc and electroplated cobalt on nickel plated copper substrates). The solar absorptancer (αs) and <b>thermal</b> <b>emittances</b> (εth) of the coatings were determined from room temperature spectral reflectance measurements in the solar (0. 3 to 2. 5 μm) and infrared regions (2. 5 to 50 μm) respectively. The effect of different preparation parameters and substrate pretreatments on the spectral selectivity has been investigated in order to optimize the thermal performance. The spectral selectivity {{is related to the}} Mo-black coating thickness and surface roughness together with the microstructure, of the substrate and the intermediate layer. Dip coatings on polished zinc have significant selectivity (αs/ εth = 8. 4 when αs = 0. 76). The absorptance of the dip coatings is increased to 0. 87 with εth = 0. 13 by chemical etching of zinc prior to coating deposition. For coatings on electroplated cobalt on nickel plated copper (cobalt (NC) substrate), an absorptance as high as 0. 94 has been obtained with an emittance value 0. 3. By using an addition agent in the plating solution of cobalt the high emittance can be reduced to 0. 1 with αs = 0. 91 giving a coating with a relatively high efficiency (82. 5...|$|R

Those coatings qualified as Interior Radiation Control Coatings must show a <b>thermal</b> <b>emittance</b> of 0.25 or less.

These low [...] "E" [...] coatings were originally developed in 1978 at the Solar Energy Corporation (SOLEC) in Princeton, New Jersey for use in tubular evacuated solar collectors. The developer, Robert Aresty, designed them to be used as low emissivity surfaces on glass to replace vacuum deposited surfaces. While SOLEC was doing collaborative work with the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), Phillip Fairey, research director at FSEC and world-renowned researcher in radiant barriers discovered the availability of these coatings in the SOLEC labs. He immediately grasped that they might be used as a replacement for foil radiant barriers, and proceeded to perform experiments verifying their viability for this use. In 1986 these coatings were applied for the first commercial application in homes built by Centex Corporation.|$|E

Buildings may earn a rating of between one and four globes. This is an online system; a building’s information is verified by a Green Globes-approved and trained licensed engineer or architect. To qualify for a rating, roofing materials must have a solar reflectance of at least 0.65 and <b>thermal</b> <b>emittance</b> of at least 0.90. As many as 10 points may be awarded for 1-100 percent roof coverage with either vegetation or highly reflective materials or both. The basis in physics of a high emittance is quite questionable, since it merely describes a material which easily radiates infrared wavelength heat to the environment, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Highly reflective, low-emittance materials are much better at reducing energy consumption.|$|E
