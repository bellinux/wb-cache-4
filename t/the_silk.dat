5|$|Nevertheless, the {{increase}} in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments of the bourgeoisie in the 19th century caused the decline of <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> industry in Europe. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. <b>The</b> <b>silk</b> road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The {{strength of}} the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process. The scale on which diffusion damping works is called <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> scale is called <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> Road from China to the West was {{initially}} formulated {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu (141–87) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.|$|E

5|$|While the Chinese {{lost their}} {{monopoly}} on silk production, {{they were able}} to re-establish themselves as major silk supplier (during the Tang dynasty), and to industrialize their production in a large scale (during the Song dynasty).

5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. <b>The</b> <b>silk</b> also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite <b>the</b> <b>silk.</b> There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), {{but they did not}} at first make the connection with <b>the</b> <b>silk</b> that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along <b>the</b> <b>Silk</b> Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E
