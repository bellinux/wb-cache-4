2500|$|As {{noted in}} the {{previous}} sections, the lentic biota are linked in complex web of <b>trophic</b> <b>relationships.</b> [...] These organisms can be considered to loosely be associated with specific trophic groups (e.g. primary producers, herbivores, primary carnivores, secondary carnivores, etc.). [...] Scientists have developed several theories {{in order to understand}} the mechanisms that control the abundance and diversity within these groups. [...] Very generally, top-down processes dictate that the abundance of prey taxa is dependent upon the actions of consumers from higher trophic levels. [...] Typically, these processes operate only between two trophic levels, with no effect on the others. [...] In some cases, however, aquatic systems experience a trophic cascade; for example, this might occur if primary producers experience less grazing by herbivores because these herbivores are suppressed by carnivores. [...] Bottom-up processes are functioning when the abundance or diversity of members of higher trophic levels is dependent upon the availability or quality of resources from lower levels. [...] Finally, a combined regulating theory, , combines the [...] predicted influences of consumers and resource availability. [...] It predicts that trophic levels close to the lowest trophic levels will be most influenced by bottom-up forces, while top-down effects should be strongest at top levels.|$|E

Using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, we aimed to study the <b>trophic</b> <b>relationship</b> between V. velella and J. globosa and investigate diet variation of V. velella and J. globosa in relation to individuals’ size. Bayesian approaches were used to calculate isotopic niche metrics and the contribution of V. velella to the J. globosa diet. Our data showed that the isotopic niche of V. velella differed markedly from that of J. globosa. It was larger and did not overlap that of the J. globosa, indicating a more variable diet but at a lower trophic level than J. globosa. The isotopic niche of V. velella also varied according to the size class of the individual. Small individuals showed a larger isotopic niche than larger animals and low overlap {{with those of the}} larger individuals. J. globosa displayed very low isotopic variability and very small isotopic niches. In contrast, there were no isotopic composition nor isotopic niche differences between J. globosa of any size. This very low isotopic variability suggested that J. globosa is a specialist predator, feeding, at least in this aggregation, principally on V. velella. Moreover, outputs of a stable isotope mixing model revealed preferential feeding on medium to large (> 500 mm 2) V. velella colonies. While our isotopic data showed the <b>trophic</b> <b>relationship</b> between V. velella and J. globosa, many questions remain about the ecology of these two organisms, demonstrating the need for more fundamental studies about neustonic ecosystems.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Viviparous {{reproduction}} in fishes provides {{opportunities for}} maternal phenotypic modifications to influence offspring phenotype following fertilization. Various physiological adaptations {{associated with the}} maintenance and control of prenatal embryonic development may provide {{the means by which}} postnatal phenotype is impacted by maternal phenotype. It is widely recognized that postzygotic maternal influences may be mediated through the maternal-embryonic <b>trophic</b> <b>relationship</b> in matrotrophic species. I propose that 1) postzygotic maternal influences in viviparous fishes may also be mediated through immunological, respiratory, osmoregulatory/excretory, endocrinological, and thermoregulatory aspects of the maternal-embryonic relationship, and 2) any modification of embryonic and/or postnatal physiology through influence of the maternal physiological state should be regarded as a maternal effect that has potential ecological and evolutionary significance.

50|$|Disturbances {{can affect}} <b>trophic</b> <b>relationships</b> {{in a variety}} of ways, such as {{simplifying}} foodwebs, causing trophic cascades, and shifting carbon sources and major pathways of energy flow (Power et al. 1985, Power et al. 2008). Part of understanding how disturbance will impact trophic dynamics lies in understanding disturbance impacts to stream metabolism (Holtgrieve et al. 2010). For example, in Alaska streams, disturbance of the benthos by spawning salmon caused distinct changes in stream metabolism; autotrophic streams became net heterotrophic during the spawning run, then reverted to autotrophy after the spawning season (Holtgrieve and Schindler 2011). There is evidence that this seasonal disturbance impacts trophic dynamics of benthic invertebrates and in turn their vertebrate predators (Holtgrieve and Schindler 2011, Moore and Schindler 2008). Wildfire disturbance may have similar metabolic and trophic impacts in streams.|$|E

[...] Much energy is lost from one trophic level to the next (about 90%); therefore, the success of higher levels is linked to lower ones and their supply of resources (Lindeman 1942). However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).|$|E

Our quantitative assessment depicted the effect of M. formosanus on 30 -h old mosquito larvae.

In the presence of predator, mosquito larvae significantly decreased browsing and filtering paths, while using mixed foraging tactics and shifting the habitat use from the bottom to surfacing or air–water interfacing. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the interaction between mosquito and cyclopoid copepods, and show that copepod predation constrains the habitat use of mosquito larvae.

The present study aimed to quantify the response of microflora and microfauna, and their linkage to different tillage treatments: no tillage (NT), ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). Soil samples were collected from 0 to 20 cm depth in April of 2011 after 10 years of conservation tillage. The abundance and richness of bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were greater in NT and RT than in CT. In case of microfauna also, similar patterns were observed with greater protozoa, bacterivores and omnivores-carnivores in NT and RT compared to CT. The connectance of the bacterial and predator-prey pathways was greater in NT and RT than in CT and that of fungal pathway was greatest in RT. The <b>trophic</b> <b>relationship</b> of the bacterial and predator-prey pathways was strengthened due to the higher water content of soil and the lower NO 3 [...] N after the conversion of CT to NT and RT.
