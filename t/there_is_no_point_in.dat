5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{but more}} complex {{translations}} {{to and from}} algebraic logics are possible for natural deduction systems as described above and for the sequent calculus. The entailments of the latter {{can be interpreted as}} two-valued, but a more insightful interpretation is as a set, the elements of which can be understood as abstract proofs organized as the morphisms of a category. In this interpretation the cut rule of the sequent calculus corresponds to composition in the category. Boolean and Heyting algebras enter this picture as special categories having at most one morphism per homset, i.e., one proof per entailment, corresponding to the idea that existence of proofs is all that matters: any proof will do and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> distinguishing them.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and {{are in the process}} of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E

Behan said, [...] "I don't hold any animosity. It's done now, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> bearing any grudges.

500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E

[...] They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. [...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. [...] Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... even if you have to empty them yourself". [...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E

2500|$|A housing {{cooperative}} is normally de facto non-profit, since usually {{most of its}} income comes from the rents paid by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> creating a deliberate surplusâ€”except for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assetsâ€”since that simply means that the rents paid by members are set higher than the expenses. (Note, however, that it's quite possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset {{the cost of the}} housing, but in those cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Tallulah Bankhead is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest stage actresses of the century, acclaimed for her natural eloquence and dynamism. [...] She excelled in both serious and comedic roles, and for over two decades, she was among the most celebrated actresses in Broadway or London's West End, praised in the superlative [...] "perhaps the greatest actress this country has ever produced." [...] For the most part, Bankhead was lauded even in her failed vehicles, and she was considered by critics to be a rare and unique talent. At the height of her career, she was a [...] "living legend", Broadway's most original leading lady. Her eccentric personality was an asset to her career rather than a hindrance, but as years of hard living took their toll, her highly publicized and often scandalous private life began to undermine her reputation of being a terrific actress. Her legend, which had once nourished her, nearly ruined her. The worst facets of her character were encouraged by her fans as virtues, and for the better part of her late career, she played to their caricature of herself. Obituaries on her passing reflected on how far she had fallen from her former grandeur, Ã  la John Barrymore. The critic Brooks Atkinson was more candid: [...] "Since Miss Bankhead lived as she wanted to, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> deploring the loss of a talented actress". However, Bankhead did not go gently into the night â€” the legend which had ruined her career made her an enormously popular icon in both the theatrical and particularly the gay community. Decades of sustained interest in Bankhead eventually realized itself in a renewed appreciation for her body of work â€” validating anew the artist behind the famous (or perhaps infamous) woman so far ahead of her time.|$|E
2500|$|The first mastersingers file {{into the}} church, {{including}} Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner {{and the town}} clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for {{the winner of the}} song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is squelched by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the [...] "Marker" [...] of the guild for worldly matters. [...] At the signal to begin (Fanget an!), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (So rief der Lenz in den Wald), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.|$|E
