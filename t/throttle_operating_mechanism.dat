50|$|The cool flame {{initiation}} of the knock process is likely only in highly <b>throttled</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, since cool flames are observed at low pressures. Under normal operating conditions, autoignition occurs without being {{triggered by a}} cool flame. Whereas the temperature and pressure of the combustion are largely determined by the engine, the composition can be controlled by various antiknock additives. The latter mainly aim at removing the radicals (such as CH2O* mentioned above) thereby suppressing {{the major source of}} the cool flame.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{raise the}} cutting {{efficiency}} {{and percentage of}} lumps for the auger mining machine, two cutting models (the axial cutting and the radial cutting) were proposed according to the mining technique of the auger mining machine. Picks installed on different positions of the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> were optimized. The <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> was developed according to the optimized result. For comparison, trials were carried out with the existing <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the same model of auger mining machine. The {{results indicate that the}} production efficiency and the advance speed of the new <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> are increased, and the axial resistance is reduced in the same conditions as the existing <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> And the drilled hole is flatness, there are no obvious cross-sections {{on the wall of the}} hole, which indicates that the stability of the new <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> is good, and taking full advantage of coal collapsing during cutting with picks. Simultaneously, the percentage of lumps of the new <b>operating</b> <b>mechanism</b> is increased, while wear on the picks is uniform...|$|R

30|$|Following {{the idea}} of signal injection, this paper proposes an {{islanding}} detection strategy based on single-phase <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of CB. With the development of micro-processor based control technology and the increased requirement of customers on power supply reliability, it is feasible for medium-voltage CB to employ single-phase <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and to open three phase circuits asymmetrically [11, 16]. Following islanding formation induced by the asymmetric tripping of CB, specific signal is obtained at DG side to identify genuine islanding from system disturbances.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{existing}} {{information systems}} have static structures, similar functions, and certain <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These features can’t provide attackers with the facilitation such as objective identification, defense behavior detection, attack techniques testing and refining, combat effectiveness evaluation and so on. Meanwhile, {{most of the}} information systems inherit the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of single processing space and resources sharing, so that invaders can achieve the desired operation through the <b>operating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of resources sharing when they enter this space. This {{is also one of the}} important basic conditions in many network attack theories, including “the side channel attack” which is used to break through the “physical isolation network” nowadays. As a result, the largest black hole of cyber security consists of determinacy in the information system architecture and mechanism, fragility in passive defensive system, deficiency in active immune mechanisms and other key issues.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} in a single-stage low speed axial research compressor are presented. The influence of four different rotor tip clearances {{on the overall}} compressor performance and on the rotor tip flow field is investigated in configurations with and without circumferential groove casing treatments. Piezo-resistive pressure transducers are used to capture the unsteady flow field in the rotor tip region. The investigated casing groove is effectively working at the three largest investigated tip clearance sizes. The largest achieved operating range increase by the groove is 6. 9 %. The groove can delay the upstream movement of the flow interface between leakage flow and main flow and thus increase the stable operating range. Rotating instabilities are shown to exist at large tip clearance sizes in <b>throttled</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. Their amplitudes can be damped by the casing groove. No modal activities could be detected in the current single-stage compressor build...|$|R
