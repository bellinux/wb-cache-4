500|$|Strong's {{architectural}} work was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> as praise worthy for its originality. He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting {{features such as}} multi-tiered greens and deep, cavernous bunkers. Strong managed to advance his art form {{to a higher level}} not always approached by other architects. Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design, Strong said, [...] "the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play." [...] He believed in the need for good shot-making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results. [...] His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers. [...] He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach, from the ideal side of the fairway, to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond. [...] Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States. [...] Strong designed this oft-copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. [...] The course was scheduled to host the 1939 Ryder Cup matches if World War II had not intervened. [...] The island itself, lying 157 yards from the tee, is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers; the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes. The Ocean Course was redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1947, then again by Bobby Weed in 1998. The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong's design features.|$|E

However, although the master has [...] "a certain grudging admiration" [...] for the manager's [...] "shrewdness," [...] Jesus labels the manager [...] "dishonest." [...] To add to the interpretations, several different sayings about money <b>were</b> attached <b>to</b> the parable here.

Susan Wloszczyna of Indiewire wrote that [...] "Woolverton set a new standard for fully fleshed-out fairy-tale heroines ... with Belle", in turn {{paving the way for}} The Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen, and Frozens Anna and Elsa (2013). Woolverton remains protective of Belle, explaining, [...] " [...] was my first-born child, so there’s a little bit of possessiveness, which really I had to let it go". Beauty and the Beast, Belle performs the film's opening number, [...] "Belle", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992. In 1998, O'Hara was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Feature Production for reprising her role as Belle in the second of Beauty and the Beasts three direct-to-video sequels, Belle's Magical World. To commemorate her work on Beauty and the Beast and various contributions to Disney, O'Hara was honored with a Disney Legends award on August 19, 2011.

500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended.</b> In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E

In July 1996, doubts about Williams' condition were aired on Radio National's The Health Report and by The Australian newspaper. The claims of [...] "faking it" [...] were denied by both Williams and Bartak. In February 2005, David Smukler, writing in the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities' journal Mental Retardation, noted that back in the mid-1990s some sceptics had a poorly defined understanding of the autism spectrum: [...] "...autistic people such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin started to publish first-person accounts that described their lives as autistic people living in an often-inhospitable nonautistic world. Many readers of these early accounts questioned whether or not the authors were really autistic. The assumption underlying such responses is that autism is so incapacitating that Williams or Grandin could not be autistic and still write with such insight and sensitivity. When their books first appeared, autistic authors were characterized either as frauds or exceptions". Smukler concluded: [...] "Today, Williams' and Grandin's 'credentials' are rarely challenged.

2500|$|The next {{controversy}} surrounding the lake followed the {{proposal for a}} fountain to be erected in the lake {{to coincide with the}} city's Golden Jubilee anniversary celebrations in 1936.

As written in The Sunday Sun Edition of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper, Saturday, August 8. 1936. The lead story in the Magazine section is; SECRETS OF THE FOUNTAIN. It was the conception and idea of then, Chief Electrical Engineer, Robert Harold Williams with Hume and Rumble Ltd. electrical contractors. R.Harold Williams designed and supervised the erection of the Vancouver's Golden Jubilee fountain. After a business trip to Los Angeles he saw a fountain and thought this would be a great gift for the city for their up and coming birthday, Golden Jubilee celebration. To build the fountain, Lost Lagoon was drained. Seventy piles were driven into the mud. On these a concrete mat was laid. The fountain was built upon this mat. The work was of necessity rushed; it was done in a month. [...] "The fountain is worthy of all the traditions of art, worthy of Vancouver's Golden Jubilee, and it will be a permanent, decorative joy in Stanley Park". [...] "When operating , it is like a symphony concert, in motion and color instead of music, says Harold Williams, engineer, of Hume & Rumble Ltd., under whose personal supervision the work has been done." [...] Vancouver's Jubilee Committee and private citizens who contributed are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> on their work in pushing for this beautiful fountain, which is sure to be one of the major attractions during the Golden Jubilee celebration. [...] "We've had to hurry," [...] says Mr. Williams," [...] in that time 285 tons of cement have been utilized and all the special equipment was built." [...] All equipment was built in Canada and the pumps were constructed in Vancouver. All union labor was employed. It was restored for Expo in 1986.|$|E
