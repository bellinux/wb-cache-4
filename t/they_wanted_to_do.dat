5|$|Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in Rob Reiner's 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap. Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest {{received}} {{a deal to}} write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures. The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, {{as well as the}} hagiographic tendencies of rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.|$|E
25|$|Work on Newtown started {{several months}} after their first live concert in April 2013, as the members created ideas and {{discussed}} what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> together as Folks.

25|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies {{have focused on the}} pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement. In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating premotor brain regions. When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.|$|E
5000|$|A key {{component}} of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan what materials <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and whom <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>they</b> can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.|$|R

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> They {{wanted to get away}} from the jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
500|$|Humphries {{said his}} point of view of these {{struggled}} sessions in a 2014 interview: “There were days when we didn’t do anything. I don’t think they knew what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we’d play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That’s all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.” ...|$|E
500|$|Generally, fans {{reacted with}} {{confusion}} {{as to why}} the short existed. Bill Oakley and several other writers loved the short so much that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more, but time limitations prevented them. As a result, Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to produce an entire episode that was nothing but loosely associated shorts, which became the season seven episode [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield". The Flanders/Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by David X. Cohen. [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield" [...] in turn inspired the Futurama episode [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys".|$|E

500|$|Ironically, Reines {{excelled in}} {{literary}} and history courses, but received average or low marks {{in science and}} math in his freshman year of high school, though he improved in those areas by his junior and senior years through the encouragement of a teacher who gave him {{a key to the}} school laboratory.

500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something a little more}} creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E

[...] Daft Punk {{discussed}} their method with Spike Jonze, director of the [...] "Da Funk" [...] music video. He noted that [...] "they were doing everything based on how <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything that would make them feel bummed on making music."

500|$|The song's {{time goes}} through a pattern {{throughout}} its entirety of one 4:4 bar, one 2:4 bar and then two 4:4 bars. In writing [...] "Lost and Running", the band was influenced by bands that they have cited as being influences on their music from early on, including David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement. There are literally only three chords in the song."" [...] He notes that the song's premise is reflective on how the group approached the recording of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, in that they were unsure of what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the album.|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|Middleton first {{encountered}} Powderfinger when {{it consisted of}} Bernard Fanning, Ian Haug, John Collins, and Jon Coghill. At the time, Middleton had been playing with Sonic Tapestry, and another band named Pirate. After seeing his band perform, Powderfinger invited Middleton to join them, and he accepted. Middleton described Powderfinger's early days as highly influenced by other popular heavy metal bands at the time, especially Pantera. Despite the band's members all having come from casual projects, the band's meetings were highly serious, according to Middleton, although he admitted they were [...] "confused" [...] in exactly what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Powderfinger generally performed covers of The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Steppenwolf, as well as Neil Young in their early days, in similar clubs to those in which Middleton had first played.|$|E

The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011. By February 2012, Rahman {{said in an interview}} with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film. He summarized the soundtrack album: [...] "It's a combination. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my kind of songs at the same time they wanted the old charm and soul of music that Indian audience would love and which I wanted to do for a long time."

Series creator Ryan Murphy explained: [...] "The theme of Regionals is celebrity judges. Sue is now a nationwide celebrity. And Olivia and Josh only like choirs that sing their songs, so that's funny. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that played against what people think about them... to play against type.

For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history. Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers' role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6'10" [...] 260-pound Moses Malone.
