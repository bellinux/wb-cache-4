40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the contributions of}} self-selection and administrative targeting to program <b>targeting</b> <b>performance</b> using unique household survey data collected {{for the evaluation of}} a Mexican social program that has acted as a regional prototype. Both forms of <b>targeting</b> improve <b>targeting</b> <b>performance,</b> but administrative selection based on proxy-means testing plays a crucial role in reducing total program coverage (to meet a budget constraint) while maintaining high coverage among the lowest income groups. Its importance is reinforced when existing knowledge barriers to participation are addressed, reflecting the high application rates among higher-income groups conditional on knowledge. Differentiating transfers based on household demographics also substantially improves <b>targeting</b> <b>performance</b> reflecting the linking of transfers to the number of children. Although expansion of the program to reduce the remaining undercoverage is likely to {{come at the expense of}} <b>targeting</b> <b>performance,</b> this trade-off can be reduced by improving the underlying proxy-means algorithm and linking transfer levels directly to proxy-means scores.

Materials and {{production}} methods, like a reverse-drawn jacket for a clean boat tail, led to yaw insensitivity, improved soft <b>target</b> <b>performance,</b> and consistent dispersion. The steel penetrator was retained and, through greater velocity and better composition and placement, substantially improved hard <b>target</b> <b>performance.</b> It met short-barrel optimization, ballistic similarity, and producibility requirements; it cost slightly more than the M855, but {{far less than the}} Mk 262. Production prove-out testing would take time, as over a million rounds had to be test-fired to ensure instances of failure would not occur at the 1 billion rounds per year scale. As information began to be made public, the original program objective to create a [...] "green round" [...] led to confusion and criticism that the Army was focusing more on environmental safety than on performance. Just as testing was being completed and the first production lots were being prepared in 2009, the rounds were found to fail at high temperatures. This caused a one-year delay to replace the bullet core, which solved the temperature problem and also improved cost and producibility.|$|E

However, the Mk 262 was not adequate as a general-purpose round and cost {{four times more}} than the M855, so it could not be produced at the volumes required for 5.56 mm ammunition (up to 1 billion rounds annually). It was also found that performance suffered when fired from standard barrels, so match grade barrels would be needed for optimum performance. The M995 armor-piercing round had high accuracy and target penetration, but was eight times more expensive than the M855. Commercial alternatives were found to have the same yaw sensitivity issues as the M855.|$|E

50|$|U.S. Special Forces {{had sought}} to create a round that had {{increased}} power out of carbine M4 barrels and compact SCAR-L barrels, while increasing hard <b>target</b> <b>performance.</b> Developmental efforts {{led to the creation}} of the Mk318. The bullet uses an open-tip design to inflict damage on soft tissue, and has a brass rear to penetrate hard targets. The tip and lead core fragments consistently even when using short barrels, while the rear moves through once the front impacts. It has more consistent performance because it is not yaw-dependent like the M855; the nose fragments upon impact and solid rear penetrator continues to move relatively straight. This makes the Mk318 effective against personnel with or without body armor. The round also increases accuracy, from 3-5 minute of angle (MOA) with the M855 from an M4A1 barrel to 1.71 MOA at 300 yards and 1.67 MOA at 600 yards from a 14 in SCAR-L barrel.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the success}} of Cyclops in beam smoothing, {{the next step was}} to further {{increase}} the energy and power in the resulting beams. Argus used a series of five groups of amplifiers and spatial filters arranged along the beamlines, each one boosting power until it reached a total of about 1 kilojoule and 1-2 terawatts per beam. These intensities would have been impossible to achieve without the use of spatial filtering. Argus was designed primarily to characterize large laser beamlines and laser-target interactions, there was no attempt to actually achieve the fusion ignition state in the device as this was understood to be impossible at the energies Argus was capable of delivering. Argus however, was used to further explore higher yields of the so-called [...] "exploding pusher" [...] type targets and to develop x-ray diagnostic cameras to view the hot plasma in such targets, a technique crucial to characterization of <b>target</b> <b>performance</b> on later ICF lasers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} paper is to examine the poverty and <b>targeting</b> <b>performance</b> of Argentina’s main policy response to the grave economic crisis of 2002 using propensity score matching techniques. The author finds that the program’s poverty reduction ability, in particular in terms of severe poverty, was strongly increasing over time, while its <b>targeting</b> <b>performance</b> was decreasing. Based on the results from this paper and bearing in mind the recovery of the Argentine economy, the author argues in favor of a tightening of the work requirement of Jefes y Jefas. Thus, it is suggested to redesign the program in a way to make in more similar to its predecessor Trabajar. While this is expected to lead to an improvement in the program’s <b>targeting</b> <b>performance,</b> the impact on poverty estimates is probably very low. Further on, the author conducts some sort of robustness analysis on the evolution of poverty rates and poverty determinants by testing for different assumptions about equivalence scales, economies of scale and poverty lines...|$|R

At the same time we use performance counters to monitor the Pirate to ensure that it is successfully stealing the desired amount of cache.
