In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> the compounds to provide fluidity to the system.

5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E

He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E

In Suffolk, millwrights would build post mills mounted on tall, two or three storey roundhouses, as at Saxtead Green.|$|E

25|$|The {{fate of the}} {{immediate}} environment of the church has been a subject of dispute between city planners since 1813.

25|$|Morphine is a pain {{medication}} of the opiate type which is found naturally {{in a number}} of plants and animals. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain. Morphine is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour. It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injecting under the skin, intravenously, into <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> the spinal cord, or rectally. Maximum effect is around 20minutes when given intravenously and 60min when given by mouth, while duration of effect is between 3h and 7h. Long-acting formulations also exist.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, the {{findings}} of tests conducted by astronomers using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), among other instruments, were released, and which positively demonstrated gravitational effects predicted by Albert Einstein. One of which tests observed the orbit of the stars circling around Sagittarius A*, a black hole about 4 million times as massive as the sun. Einstein’s theory suggested that large objects bend <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> them, causing other objects to diverge from the straight lines they would otherwise follow. Although previous studies have validated Einstein's theory, {{this was the first}} time his theory had been tested on such a gigantic object. The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal.|$|E

25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but the vents of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the anteroom by dividers (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>around</b> them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to}} get to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
