5|$|Zinc oxide {{is added}} to many food products, {{including}} breakfast cereals, {{as a source of}} zinc, a necessary nutrient. (Zinc sulfate is also used for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.)</b> Some prepackaged foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient.|$|E
5|$|A castle {{here could}} guard {{several of the}} main {{strategic}} routes and form part {{of a network of}} strongholds of the Norman kingdom, in the former Danish Mercia, roughly the area today referred to as the East Midlands, to control the country internally. Also it was a centre from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the Welland, to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans had constructed for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E

Colonel Beriah Norton made two special trips to London for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament. Very little was accomplished in these two trips to England.|$|E
5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even in Turkey {{a system}} of weights similar to the European apothecaries' system was used for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> For medical {{purposes}} the tcheky (approx. 320g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 killos or) 64 grains. This {{is close to the}} classical Greek weight system, where a mina (corresponding roughly to a Roman libra) was also divided into 100 drachms.|$|E
5|$|Matthias convoked the Diet to make {{preparations}} for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid {{could be expected}} from the Christian powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.|$|E

5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties {{to those of the}} bulk boride.|$|E
5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly {{and one of his}} homeschooled students appeared on the CBC program The Hour for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E

5|$|The {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced}} by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> The five-masted schooner sail-plan {{was replaced by}} four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, Great Britain went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs & Sons, which planned to place her into England-Australia service.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose</b> as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.|$|E
5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose,</b> having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the nearly}} {{identical}} names, the SRHP is not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as <b>the</b> Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, a smaller but similar breed {{with a slightly}} longer coat developed for essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> by <b>the</b> Dutch and now most common in France.|$|R

5|$|These {{statistics}} do {{not include}} results from the Allsvenskan play-offs (held between 1982 and 1990), but those from Mästerskapsserien (held in 1991 and 1992) are included.

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b> Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Article 2 of {{this brief}} {{protocol}} recognizes an additional distinctive emblem, the Red Crystal, {{that may be}} used in addition to, and for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>purposes</b> as, <b>the</b> Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols.
