5|$|In March 1956, the USAF {{placed a}} further order for 65 F-105Bs and 17 RF-105Bs. In order {{to conduct the}} nuclear mission, an MA-8 fire control system, AN/APG-31 ranging radar, and K-19 gunsight to allow for <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> were integrated. The first {{pre-production}} YF-105B flew on 26 May 1956. Five of the F-105C trainer variant {{were added to the}} procurement plan in June 1956, before being canceled in 1957. The RF-105 reconnaissance variant was canceled in July 1956. The first production F-105B was accepted by the Air Force on 27 May 1957. In June 1957, Republic Aviation requested that the F-105 be named Thunderchief, continuing the sequence of the company's Thunder-named aircraft: P-47 Thunderbolt, F-84 Thunderjet, and F-84F Thunderstreak. The USAF made the name official a month later.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{specification}} {{developed during}} 1951, {{the development of}} the BOAR rocket was started in 1952 at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), located at China Lake, California. The project was intended to provide a simple means of extending the stand-off range of nuclear weapons delivered using the <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> technique, as some slower aircraft still faced marginal escape conditions when delivering ordinary gravity bombs even with the use of this technique.|$|E
25|$|The TAC {{request for}} a {{fighter-bomber}} was addressed with the F-100C which flew in March 1954 and entered service on 14 July 1955, with the 450th Fighter Wing, Foster AFB, Texas. Operational testing in 1955 revealed that the F-100C was at best an interim solution, sharing all the flaws of the F-100A. The uprated J57-P-21 engine boosted performance but continued to suffer from compressor stalls. However, the F-100C was considered an excellent platform for nuclear <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> because of its high top speed. The inertia coupling problem was reasonably addressed with the installation of a yaw damper in the 146th F-100C, later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. A pitch damper was added starting with the 301st F-100C, {{at a cost of}} US$10,000 per aircraft.|$|E
50|$|While {{deployed}} in Europe with NATO, RCAF CF-104 fighter-bombers carried a <b>Toss</b> <b>Bomb</b> Computer until their nuclear role was eliminated by the Canadian government effective 1 January 1972.|$|R

50|$|Two {{players can}} play through the single player game {{together}} cooperatively. Alternatively, {{there is the}} Battle Mode, where one to two players can face off against up to three AI players in one of ten arenas designed specifically for multiplayer play. Matches can be customized as battle royal matches or as team matches. Besides the regular items found in singleplayer mode, the glove (allowing Bomberman {{to pick up and}} <b>toss</b> <b>bombs)</b> and speed increases can be found in multiplayer.|$|R
25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or <b>toss</b> <b>bombing,</b> tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a Bâ€“47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under computer control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as Milk Bottle was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1955, Feightner assumed {{command of}} VF-11 {{also known as}} The Red Rippers. Flying the McDonnell F2H-4 Banshee, he led VF-11 to top honors in <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> during the annual fleet {{competition}} in 1956. All fourteen VF-11 pilots received the Navy's Battle Effectiveness Award for precision accuracy with this unusual and difficult technique used to deliver nuclear weapons. With this award, VF-11 became the first Atlantic fleet unit {{to have all of}} its pilots receive an [...] "E" [...] in the same exercise.|$|E
50|$|Various air-dropping {{techniques}} exist, including <b>toss</b> <b>bombing,</b> parachute-retarded delivery, and laydown modes, {{intended to}} give the dropping aircraft time to escape the ensuing blast.|$|E

25|$|The fence {{along the}} border made it {{difficult}} to cross into Israel. In March 1981, a similar attempt was made when an intruder, using a motorized hang glider reached Haifa Bay and <b>tossed</b> some <b>bombs,</b> but was forced to land after running out of fuel and was arrested.|$|R
5000|$|Fin {{stops the}} car to save the {{children}} stuck in the bus from the assaulting sharks. Afterwards, the bus driver is killed by the [...] "H" [...] in the Hollywood Sign. While Nova is driving the car, a shark lands {{on top of the}} car and rips the roof off. Fin's hand is cut and the group abandons the car before it explodes. They steal another car and meet up with Fin and April's son Matt, who is found taking shelter at his flight school. They borrow equipment from a nearby storage and Matt and Nova become attracted to each other. Matt and Nova decide to stop the threat of the incoming [...] "sharknadoes" [...] by <b>tossing</b> <b>bombs</b> into them from a helicopter. Two are destroyed, but they are unable to stop the third one.|$|R
50|$|The LABS {{system was}} {{originally}} designed to facilitate a tactic called <b>toss</b> <b>bombing,</b> to allow the aircraft to remain {{out of range of}} a weapon's blast radius. The principle of calculating the release point, however, was eventually integrated into the fire control computers of later bombers and strike aircraft, allowing level, dive and <b>toss</b> <b>bombing.</b> In addition, as the fire control computer became integrated with ordnance systems, the computer can take the flight characteristics of the weapon to be launched into account.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Toss</b> <b>bombing</b> (a type {{of bombing}} of which exact {{opposite}} of that dive bombing, where the aircraft need to pull up before releasing the bomb) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Dive-toss {{delivery}} {{technique was}} the first [...] "toss" [...] bombing method developed after WWII at the US Navy's rocket development center at Inyokern, California in 1947 as a method to attack heavily defended targets without unduly endangering the attacking aircraft. Although <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> might seem the direct opposite to dive bombing, where the plane pitches downward to aim at its target, <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> is often performed with a short dive before the bomber raises its nose and releases its bomb. This variant is known as [...] "dive tossing". This gives both the bomb and aircraft extra momentum, thereby helping the aircraft regain altitude after the release and also ensuring that airspeed at the calculated release point is still sufficient to get the bomb to the target.|$|E
50|$|Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) reveals Gruber is an alias and {{his real}} name is Jack Buchinsky, having bribed a guard to change his name. He gives Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) overshoes to avoid electricity. Lee reveals that killers make {{elaborate}} dolls of their victims, {{one of the victims}} turning out to be Maroni. Buchinsky attacks his restaurant, knocking out Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and <b>tossing</b> a <b>bomb,</b> with minimal damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{surveyor}} general, Miller, is sure Reavis {{has somehow}} doctored the documents. He brings in Griff, {{an expert on}} forgery. In the meantime, Reavis orders settlers and families off [...] "his" [...] land. A displaced rancher, Lansing, <b>tosses</b> a <b>bomb</b> into Reavis' office. It still does not discourage him, so Pepito finally threatens to reveal that Sofia's parents were not Spanish land barons at all, but native Indians.|$|R
50|$|Sonic, {{who drives}} {{a red and}} white sports car known as the Cyclone, has great speed and {{handling}} but poor control, and has a speed boost as his Special Ability. Tails, who drives a 1960s-era Formula 1 car called the MTP-01 Wheelwind, is well-balanced {{in terms of his}} speed, acceleration and handling, but does not stand out in any particular area- he can utilize a powerful jump as his Special Ability, which allows him to avoid obstacles and particularly tough corners. Eggman (as he is referred to in this game), who pilots a modified version of his standard Eggmobile known as the Egg Typhoon, has poor acceleration, but has very high top speed and cornering abilities, and can <b>toss</b> <b>Bombs</b> onto the track that can cause his rivals to spin out. Finally, Amy Rose, who drives a yellow and blue vintage convertible called the Breeze, has great acceleration at the cost of low top speed, and has the ability to attack by throwing small heart-shaped objects that slow down her opponents and alter their controls for a short time.|$|R
50|$|When {{the bomb}} was {{delivered}} by low-level <b>toss</b> <b>bombing,</b> the aircraft was almost always at a lower altitude than the burst height; so in effect, {{the bomb was}} not really 'dropped', but was released and 'flew' upwards in a ballistic trajectory, to detonate when it reached the required altitude.|$|E
50|$|<b>Toss</b> <b>bombing</b> (sometimes {{known as}} loft bombing, {{and by the}} U.S. Air Force as the Low Altitude Bombing System, LABS) is a method of bombing where the attacking {{aircraft}} pulls upward when releasing its bomb load, giving the bomb additional time of flight by starting its ballistic path with an upward vector.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> is to {{compensate}} for the gravity drop of the bomb in flight, and allow an aircraft to bomb a target without flying directly over it. This is in order to avoid overflying a heavily defended target, or in order to distance the attacking aircraft from the blast effects of a nuclear (or conventional) bomb.|$|E
50|$|On January 31, 1933, Jimmy O'Brien {{was killed}} by Nitti's gunmen {{in front of the}} Garage Nightclub. O'Brien was one of Touhy's union men and one of the latest victims of the Touhy-Nitti feud. A week later, a man {{identified}} as Banghart returned to the nightclub where he stepped out of a sedan and <b>tossed</b> a <b>bomb</b> through the front doors of the club. No one was injured but the club itself was heavily damaged.|$|R
50|$|If {{the option}} {{on the main}} menu is turned on, {{there will be two}} non-player sides that pose a threat to the player's armies. A Native American who lives {{to the west of the}} {{territory}} might hurl a giant tomahawk randomly at one of the westernmost states, destroying the army unfortunate enough to be garrisoned there. Similarly, a sombrero-clad Mexican living to the southwest might suddenly wake up from his siesta and <b>toss</b> a <b>bomb</b> into Texas, result being the same.|$|R
50|$|A female bomber {{created in}} episode 4, {{capable of making}} {{ultrasound}} <b>bombs</b> and <b>toss</b> back <b>bombs</b> thrown by opponents. She has an uncontrollable urge to jump through hoops. She wears a swim ring with a skirt underneath, a seashell bra, and lipstick. She was destroyed by Shirobon's bomb when Dolphin Bomber tries to jump through a hoop created by modifying Gangu; she was turned back into a normal dolphin. She reappeared {{to compete in the}} B-1 Grand Prix, but lost in the first round when the pool where Dolphin Bomber is in dried up.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Toss</b> <b>bombing</b> is {{generally}} used by pilots whenever {{it is not}} desirable to overfly the target with the aircraft at an altitude sufficient for dive-bombing or level bombing. Such cases include heavy anti-air defenses such as AAA and SAMs, when deploying powerful weapons such as 2,000 lb. [...] "iron bombs" [...] or even tactical nuclear bombs, {{and the use of}} limited-aspect targeting devices for guided munitions.|$|E

50|$|Its {{measurements}} were 3.66 m in length, 0.71 m in diameter, and a weight of approximately 1750 lb. Two versions were produced: the Mk.1, with a yield of 15 kilotons, and the Mk.2, with a yield of 25 kilotons. The Mk.2 {{was available in}} two variants, the No.1 used by high-altitude bombers, and the No.2 variant that was intended for low-level delivery by the <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> method, and its 'over-the-shoulder' variant {{referred to as the}} Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS).|$|E
60|$|Being provident (and lazy, for I {{have learned}} that it takes time and labour to {{manufacture}} home-made bombs), I pinched off the live end of the fuse in my hand. But the fuse of the first bomb, rolling about on the main deck, merely fizzled on; and as I waited I resolved to shorten my remaining fuses. Any {{of the men who}} fled, had he had the courage, could have pinched off the fuse, or <b>tossed</b> the <b>bomb</b> overboard, or, better yet, he could have tossed it up amongst us on the poop.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} the next four months that Hopkinson asked Mike Hickey about various ideas to either kill William Roitz or Vincent Vehar. Hopkinson promised Hickey $2,000 plus {{expenses}} and help in covering up the Wyckhuyse murder, if he {{would take care of}} one of these two men. Hopkinson and Hickey made several trips to various locations in the area in order to plan how the murder should be executed. Finally, by the end of July, Hopkinson had concluded that it was Vehar who should be killed and {{that the best way to}} do it was to <b>toss</b> a <b>bomb</b> through a basement window of the Vehar home.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{he was an}} {{advocate}} of certain rights and causes, he was skeptical of others. Despite his own candid clubhouse reporting, Young blasted Jim Bouton as a [...] "social leper" [...] {{after the publication of}} the pitchers tell-all book Ball Four. The head of the players union, Marvin Miller, was negatively characterized as a [...] "Svengali". And when an arbitrator ruled in favor of the union, thus ending baseballs reserve clause, Youngs first reaction was to write: [...] "Peter Seitz reminds me of a terrorist, a little man to whom nothing very important has happened in his lifetime, who suddenly decides to create some excitement by <b>tossing</b> a <b>bomb</b> into things." ...|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{ever-increasing}} power levels of new jet engines led to fighter aircraft with bomb loads similar to heavy bombers {{of a generation}} earlier. This generated demand {{for a new generation}} of greatly improved bombsights that could be used by a single-crew aircraft and employed in fighter-like tactics, whether high-level, low-level, in a dive towards the target, or during hard maneuvering. A specialist capability for <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> also developed in order to allow aircraft to escape the blast radius of their own nuclear weapons, something that required only middling accuracy but a very different trajectory that initially required a dedicated bombsight.|$|E
5000|$|Iraq {{deployed}} its Tu-22s {{during the}} [...] "War of the Cities", flying air-raids against Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, with these attacks supplemented by Iraqi Scud and Al Hussein missiles. Iran retaliated against Iraqi cities {{with its own}} Scuds. The Iraqi Air Force were particularly enthusiastic users of the gargantuan FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) general-purpose bomb, which skilled Tu-22 pilots could deploy with impressive accuracy, utilizing supersonic <b>toss</b> <b>bombing</b> techniques at stand-off distances and allowing the aircraft to escape retaliatory anti-aircraft fire. Usage of the FAB-9000 was so heavy that the Iraqis ran low of imported Soviet stocks and resorted to manufacturing their own version, called the Nassir-9.|$|E
