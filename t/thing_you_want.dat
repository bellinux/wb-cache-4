500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the last <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Post {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone praised the album for providing a [...] "much-needed escape route" [...] from the alternative rock offerings {{of the early}} 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: [...] "When Post comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: the last <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is re-enter the real world". Comparing it to Björk's previous studio album Debut, Slant Magazines Eric Henderson felt Post [...] "upped the ante by plugging listeners into the diverse pop mixtape playing inside her mind". In the end, he argued that it [...] "will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber stated that despite Posts [...] "bizarre" [...] combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk's delivery and assuring hooks [...] " [...] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards". Ultimately, {{he felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age".|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment.

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You can call it the Chanticleer, you can call it a fighting cock, you can call it any damn <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E
