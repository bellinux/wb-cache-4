40|$|Rotating disks {{have many}} {{applications}} in the aerospace industry such as gas turbines and gears. These disks normally work under thermo mechanical loads. Minimizing the weight of such components can help reduce the overall payload in aerospace industry. For this purpose, a rotating functionally graded (FG) disk with variable thickness under a steady temperature field is considered in this paper. Thermo elastic solutions {{and the weight of}} the disk are related to the material grading index and the geometry of the disk. It is found that a disk with parabolic or hyperbolic convergent <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> has smaller stresses and displacements compared to a uniform thickness disk. Maximum radial stress due to centrifugal load in the solid disk with parabolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> may not be at the center unlike uniform thickness disk. Functionally graded disk with variable thickness has smaller stresses due to thermal load compared to those with uniform thickness. It is seen that for a given value of grading index, the FG disk having concave <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the lightest in weight whereas the FG disk with uniform <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the heaviest. Also for any given <b>thickness</b> <b>profile,</b> the weight of the FG disk lies in between the weights of the all-metal and the all-ceramic disks...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{model has}} been {{developed}} to investigate steady state creep in a variable thickness rotating disc made of functionally graded Al-SiCp. The SiCp content in the disc is assumed to decrease from the inner to outer radius. The creep behavior of the disc material is described by threshold stress based law with a stress exponent of 5. The stresses and strain rates in the disc are estimated by solving creep constitutive equations along with the equilibrium equation for a rotating disc. The stresses and strain rates have been estimated for similar FGM discs with three different <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> i. e. constant thickness, linearly varying thickness and hyperbolic varying thickness. The FGM disc having hyperbolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> exhibits the lowest stresses and strain rates compared linear or constant thickness disc. The tangential and radial strain rates in FGM discs with linear and hyperbolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> are respectively lower by about two and three orders of magnitude when compared to a constant thickness FGM disc.

Methods: Epithelial, stromal, and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured in vivo by Artemis very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound scanning (ArcScan) across the central 6 - to 10 -mm diameter of the cornea on 54 keratoconic eyes. Maps of the average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range of epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thickness were plotted. The average location of the thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were found. The crosssectional semi-meridional stromal and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were calculated using annular averaging. The absolute stromal and total corneal thickness progressions relative to the thinnest point were calculated using annular averaging {{as well as for}} 8 semi-meridians individually. Results: The mean corneal vertex epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thicknesses were 45. 7 ± 5. 9 μm, 426. 4 ± 38. 5 μm and 472. 2 ± 41. 4 μm respectively. The average epithelial <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> showed an epithelial doughnut pattern characterized by localized central thinning surrounded by an annulus of thick epithelium. The thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were displaced on average by 0. 48 ± 0. 66 mm temporally and 0. 32 ± 0. 67 mm inferiorly, 0. 31 ± 0. 45 mm temporally and 0. 54 ± 0. 37 mm inferiorly, and 0. 31 ± 0. 43 mm temporally and 0. 50 ± 0. 35 mm inferiorly, respectively, with reference to the corneal vertex.

40|$|In this study, the {{evolution}} of the <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of UHMW-polyethylene films during sequential biaxial drawing is studied. The basic assumption is that a nonunifonn thickness distribution of the drawn film {{is the result of the}} amplification of initial imperfections. Finite element simulations of the drawing process have been performed in which the drawing of a piece of film with a geometric imperfection is considered. For these numerical simulations, a viscoelastic model is adopted. Although the model does not describe the behavior of UHMW-PE films in full detail, it is able to capture typical features of inhomogeneous deformation. The most striking observation is that severe localization occurs at the beginning of the second drawing step (i. e. in the direction transverse to the first step). In this stage of the drawing process, a localization band develops. These phenomena are also observed in validation experiments. A discrepancy between the simulations and the validation experiments is observed at the end of the drawing process. In the simulations, the deformation is stabilized again, and the resulting <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is practically uniform. In the experiments however, the bad <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> at the beginning of the second drawing step is conserved up to the end of the drawing process.
