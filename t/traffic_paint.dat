5000|$|Lead {{paint or}} lead-based paint is paint {{containing}} lead. As pigment, lead(II) chromate (PbCrO4, [...] "chrome yellow"), Lead(II,IV) oxide, (Pb3O4, [...] "red lead"), and lead(II) carbonate (PbCO3, [...] "white lead") {{are the most}} common forms. Lead is added to paint to speed up drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. It {{is one of the main}} health and environmental hazards associated with paint. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use, whereas countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free <b>traffic</b> <b>paint</b> are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a survey on the use of yellow versus white <b>traffic</b> <b>paint.</b> It was found that in most states the white paint was less expensive than the yellow. A substantial savings could be realized if an all white traffic marking system was permitted by the Federal Highway Administration. Paint costs from each state are presented, as well as by each region...|$|E

50|$|The first prototypes were {{delivered}} in October 1958. The first thirty-seven individual locomotives differed {{only in their}} livery: twenty built for passenger <b>traffic</b> were <b>painted</b> in grey-green, while seventeen built for goods were painted in auburn. Later, the freight locomotives were reclassed E.645. The total number of locomotives built amounted to 295 units.|$|R
40|$|Roads are {{becoming}} deterioration in everywhere. In some places, <b>traffic</b> marks <b>painted</b> on roads are damaged thus {{needed to be}} updated. Municipalities must manage road condition and <b>traffic</b> marks (road <b>painting).</b> It is the municipalities task to manage those roads using, for example, special inspection cars and human eyes. However, the management cost is high if a city contains many roads. This paper proposes a mechanism that automates this management. Our idea is to leverage cameras attached to garbage trucks, which run through the entire city almost everyday. The mechanism collects road images and detects damaged traffic marks using an image recognition algorithm. This paper shows the algorithm and reports the benchmark results. The benchmark showed that the mechanism can detect the damaged traffic marks with 76. 6 % precision...|$|R
50|$|The bridge saw {{extensive}} repairs in 1990, and {{was painted}} in spring of 2009.

2500|$|The 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge {{undergoes}} a rigorous maintenance schedule {{that is a}} year-long effort. Maintenance crews often perform replacement of steel parts, and inspect the steel cables and towers at night or at low <b>traffic</b> hours. <b>Painting</b> the bridge is also a drawn-out task. Working only during the summer months, it takes ten years to paint the span. The color of the bridge is officially known as [...] "Narrows Green", a grayish-green hue that was the original color of the ill-fated 1940 span (called Chrome Green in a 1940 newspaper report on {{the final stages of}} Gertie's construction).|$|R

50|$|They {{were the}} last new {{locomotives}} designed by McIntosh before his retirement. The type was essentially a superheated version of the earlier 908 Class and were built primarily for use on express goods trains, although they also worked on passenger <b>traffic</b> and were <b>painted</b> in the Caledonian's blue passenger livery. The locomotives were the most successful of McIntosh's various 4-6-0 designs.|$|R
5000|$|By November 1, the {{painting}} {{had begun to}} attract local news coverage. It was dubbed the [...] "Pink Lady" [...] by the media, due to the pink paint used for the skin. Los Angeles County road officials, concerned about <b>traffic</b> problems the <b>painting</b> might cause, attempted to remove it with high-pressure spray from fire hoses, and then with paint stripper.

50|$|A {{ghost island}} is a United Kingdom highway term {{referring}} to a <b>painted</b> <b>traffic</b> island, typically a central area of a single carriageway road that is hatched with paint to indicate that vehicles should not enter. Ghost islands are frequently used at junctions to discourage overtaking and to provide space for turning traffic to wait. They are also sometimes used for longer sections where a road is exceptionally wide (e.g. {{where it has been}} converted from three lanes to two).|$|R
50|$|Overall, HRM remains fairly {{difficult}} for bicycles, partially {{as a result}} of geography and climate, but also traffic congestion and significant gaps in the cycling network. Despite these weaknesses, there has been a gradual {{increase in the number of}} bicycle lanes and designated bike routes in the urban core. By 2013, HRM had 226 km of AT facilities (131 kilometres of greenway and 96 kilometres of bike lanes). The first protected cycling lane in Halifax opened in November 2015 as a pilot project. The lanes are separated from automotive <b>traffic</b> by a <b>painted</b> median and plastic bollards.|$|R
5000|$|The Colonial Parkway is free {{of trucks}} and {{commercial}} vehicles except passenger-carrying buses. The lower speed limits, enforced by the National Park Service law enforcement rangers, coupled with few exits, combine to help preserve the road for tourists and protect wildlife by making it an unattractive short-cut for most local traffic and commuters. It has no <b>painted</b> <b>traffic</b> lane-marking lines, and some stretches are posted [...] "Pass With Care". The unmarked pavement is made of rounded [...] "river gravel" [...] set in a concrete-mix, providing an unusual earth tone color. Despite a federal policy instituted late in the 20th century of requiring user fees at many National Parks and Monuments, the Colonial Parkway has remained toll-free.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the exposure to lead from various sources by investigation of mineral composition of human scalp hair. The research was carried out on hair sampled from 267 young adults living in Wrocław (southwest Poland). The effect of the place of residence, diet, and lifestyle on lead content in hair was examined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Lead was determined at the wavelength 220. 353 nm. These outcomes were reached by linking the results of lead level in hair with the results of questionnaire survey. The mean lead level in hair of the whole examined population was 2. 01 ± 2. 10 mg kg− 1. Lead can enter the human body mainly by inhalation and gastrointestinal absorption. It was found that consuming cheese, fish, and lettuce caused increased level of lead in hair. On the other hand, drinking of milk, tea, coffee, or lemon resulted in decreased content of lead in hair. Additional source of exposure to lead could be cigarette smoking, distance to the <b>traffic</b> road, <b>painting</b> the walls, amalgam filling. Based on the results, it can be concluded that exposure to lead can occur mainly from eating habits and environmental exposure...|$|R
40|$|By {{commission}} of the Mälardalen Region of the Swedish National Road Administration, the Swedish Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) studied {{the effect of}} improvements to streets in five towns. The effects studied related to safety, accessibility, emissions of gases, particulates and noise by vehicles. The views of road users regarding the improvements and their effects were also examined. This was done via questionnaire surveys. The improvements were intended to reduce vehicle speeds and the distance over which vulnerable road users were exposed to vehicular traffic. Roundabouts, cycle tracks and refuges were constructed. At one site a roundabout with a <b>traffic</b> island <b>painted</b> so as to give a three dimensional impression was tested. Other improvement measures were raising of pedestrian/cycle crossings, improvement of lighting at pedestrian and cycle crossings. The sites were videoed. This material {{was used as the}} basis in assessing the traffic safety effect, counting road users and determining vehicle speeds at points where vulnerable road users crossed the street. Pneumatic tube measurements were made to determine route choice and journey times. At one site, the driving patterns of vehicles were surveyed via a pursuit vehicle. The gas and particulate emissions of vehicles were calculated with the VETO model. This model was also used to calculate the effect of the improvements on traffic noise...|$|R
50|$|While {{the second}} bridge was being built, the Sturgeon Bay Bridge {{continued}} {{to fall into}} disrepair, and maintenance became urgently needed. A 2007 bridge inspection assessed the bridge as structurally deficient, mainly due to its poor superstructure and substructure. In July 2008, the bridge was closed to all traffic for two days because of structural problems; once it reopened, it still only carried light traffic, and a bridge tender and law enforcement rigidly enforced the weight limit. Once the Maple and Oregon Street Bridge opened on September 22, the Sturgeon Bay Bridge closed to all traffic again so repair work could be done. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation plans to restore the bridge due to its historic significance despite {{the opening of the}} second bridge.In December 2010 the bridge was reopened to foot and vehicle traffic. The bridge has been re-opened to foot and vehicle <b>traffic</b> after being <b>painted</b> in spring 2011. Newer features to the bridge include LED lights, traffic signals, and CCTV cameras.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 50) From June through August of 1977, {{on eight}} separate occasions, several employees {{of a large}} California municipality engaged in street painting operations were monitored for a possible occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium. The potential exposure {{stems from the fact}} that lead chromate, a hexavalent chromium compound, is utilized as a pigment component in specific colors of <b>traffic</b> marking <b>paints.</b> Those individuals monitored were all employed as members of street painting crews at the time when the sampling was conducted. Analytical results of all samples indicate employee breathing zone concentrations of chromium (VI) to be below the current Occupational Safety and Health Act Standard, as well as the standard NIOSH recommended in the 1975 criteria document, under the conditions monitored in this study. However, the potential for high concentrations existing was shown by the results taken at various positions on the rigs while street painting was in progress. It was assumed that airborne concentration levels of chromium (VI) at any location on a painting rig, will be dependent upon the distance this location is from the source of paint aerosols, the paint spray nozzle. The results then indicate that there are locations on the painting rigs which may allow for an occupational exposure to chromium (VI) if individuals were positioned in these locations while painting was in progress. This was not the case with the rigs used by individuals who were sampled in this study. There are rigs in use by other municipalities which do require individuals to be stationed in areas where they may be exposed to chromium (VI) ...|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the South-Eastern Region of the Swedish Road Administration, VTI has {{evaluated}} the effect of a roundabout with a <b>painted</b> <b>traffic</b> island. The island was painted so that it appeared three dimensional. Safety was studied, as well as accessibility and behaviour. The intersection is situated in the central place in Söderköping Municipality. It is a fourway intersection, with Östra Rydsvägen as the primary road and Ringvägen as the secondary road. Before construction of the roundabout, motor vehicles on Ringvägen had to give way to traffic on Östra Rydsvägen. The spot speeds of motor vehicles were measured near the intersection and at points ca 100 m from the intersection. With a programme developed by VTI, based on information from the spot speed measurements, changes in trip times were studied. The intersection was video filmed daily before and after construction, between 6. 30 and 18. 30 hours. The videoed material was used as the basis in judging the safety effect, accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists, and for the behavioural study...|$|R

50|$|Built in 1923 as a 2-8-2 by Davey Paxman of Colchester and {{designed}} by Henry Greenly, {{it was designed}} to haul both stone and passenger trains, however soon found more use on passenger <b>traffic.</b> It was <b>painted</b> works grey in 1924, then LMS red with black and straw lining to 1927. It was repainted mid green with black and yellow lining during a rebuild in 1928 by the Yorkshire Engine Co., when the engine received a Poultney steam tender, making the loco a 2-8-2-0-8-0. This proved unsuccessful and was soon removed, instead being utilised nearly forty years later as part of the second River Mite, after languishing at Murthwaite. The locomotive was out of use from 1940 to 1952, survived into the preservation era and was repainted in a new livery of LNWR black in 1967 and received a new tender in 1970. In 1983, the Esk was fitted with a gas-producer boiler and received an award from British Coal, however this has been out of use since 2001. The locomotive has visited the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway several times and was a predecessor to that railway's Greenly Pacific locomotives. The engine is currently in Blackberry Black of the LNWR with red, off-white and black lining.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} pattern of soil lead (Pb) levels is {{essential}} to protecting human health. Most previous studies have examined soil Pb distributions by either urbanization gradient or land-use type. Few studies, however, have examined both factors together. It remains unclear whether the impacts of land use on soil Pb levels are consistent along the urbanization gradient. To fill this gap, we investigated variations in soil Pb level under different land-use types along the urbanization gradient in Beijing, China. We classified the degree of urbanization as the urban core, transitional zone, or suburban area and the land-use type as industrial area, roadside, residential area, institutional area, road greenbelt, park, or forest. Our {{results showed that the}} range of soil Pb levels in Beijing is < 1 mg/kg– 292 mg/kg, with a mean of 22 mg/kg. Along the urbanization gradient, the mean soil Pb level increased from the suburban area to the urban core. Land-use types have an impact on soil Pb levels, however, when the degree of urbanization is considered, the impact from land use on soil Pb level was only significant in the transitional zone. Parks and road greenbelts were found to have lower soil Pb, primarily due to soil restoration. Roadside and residential areas were found to have higher soil Pb because of <b>traffic</b> emissions, leaded <b>paint,</b> and previous industrial contamination. In the urban core and suburban area, the soil Pb level showed no significant differences among various land-use types. Given the results of soil Pb in various land-use types, we suggest that future studies consider the urbanization gradient in which different land-use samples are located...|$|R
40|$|In {{the region}} of {{north-western}} Croatia (NWC) 328 topsoil samples were taken (from a depth of 0 to 25 cm). The composite samples were analyzed after near total decomposition (a hot acid mixture: HClO 4 –HNO 3 –HCl–HF at 200 °C) by ICP–AES for As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. Hg was analysed by cold vapour AAS. The following element concentration ranges were acquired: As 2 – 74 mg/kg (geometric mean 8 mg/kg), Cd 0. 4 – 9. 4 mg/kg (geometric mean 0. 4 mg/kg), Cu 5 – 248 mg/kg (geometric mean 22 mg/kg), Hg 5 – 4, 535 mg/t (geometric mean 55 mg/t), Pb 15 – 699 (geometric mean 32 mg/kg) and Zn 28 – 1, 432 (geometric mean 82 mg/kg). The analysis of the spatial distribution of heavy metals in NWC showed increased values of As, Cd, Hg and Pb at Mts. Zumberak, Medvednica, Ivanscica and Kalnik that originate mainly from natural sources (bedrock mineralizations and ore deposits). The Cu and Zn contents on Mt. Medvednica are only slightly less natural in origin. The high concentrations of copper {{on the slopes of}} Mts. Zumberak, Medvednica, Kalnik and in the NW part of Hrvatsko Zagorje are of anthropogenic origin and are related to wine-growing areas. In the Sava River valley the average levels of Hg, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb are higher than the calculated baseline values (geochemical background) in the NWC while the Cu values are equal to the baseline values. The higher values of As, Cd, Pb, and (in part) Zn are for the most part of anthropogenic origin, {{and to a lesser extent}} of natural origin. The Hg in the topsoil has a strong anthropogenic influence caused by mining upstream (Litija) and by the city of Zagreb’s urban area (fossil fuel combustion, <b>traffic,</b> electrolysis, diverse <b>paints,</b> pharmaceutical products, chlor-alkali industry and paper industry). The pedogenic profile shows that the content of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn at a depth of 20 cm is almost half the content of the same elements found in the first two centimeters of the soil. At a depth of 60 cm, the concentrations are in the level of background values characteristic of the preindustrial era. When compared to the calculated baseline values, the contents of As, Cd, Cu and Hg in the soils of the Drava River valley are higher, while the Pb and Zn contents are anomalous. According to permitted concentrations of heavy metals for ecological food production prescribed by Government regulations the contents of As, Pb and Zn in the topsoil on the Drava alluvial sediment are too high. The Cu concentrations are lower than the limit permitted by Government regulation. The higher contents of mercury, although under the limit prescribed by Government regulation, are an immediate consequence of fossil fuel combustion and traffic in the urban area of the city of Varaždin. Factor analysis and high correlation coefficients show a mutual connection of Pb, Zn and Cd (Pb and Zn r= 0. 96; Pb and Cd r= 0. 80; Zn and Cd r= 0. 84). These 3 heavy metals show high positive factor loadings on the first factor (F 1) which accounts for more than 58 % of the data variability. The flood waters of the Drava River were highly loaded with anthropogenic Pb, Zn and Cd mainly as a consequence of mining, smelting and flotation activities upstream in the Meza valley in the Republic of Slovenia and Austria. Also, they were additionally loaded with waste waters from upstream settlements. The soil profile shows that increasing depth results in the lowering of the Pb, Zn, Cd and As content reaching the background level of that area at 80 cm depth. This suggests that the alluvial sediments of the pre-industrial era lay deeper...|$|R
