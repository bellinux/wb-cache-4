5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> another for trim tiles near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|E

5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between <b>tiles,</b> <b>and</b> that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E

Similarly to the numbered Last Bible titles, players can recruit and fuse monsters in Another Bible. Last Bible Special is a role-playing game that is controlled from a first person perspective, and in which players aim to travel through four dungeons.|$|E
