As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> do so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E

5|$|Simonsohn {{also raised}} the {{possibility}} of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E
50|$|Advocates {{argue that}} just as women are able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether <b>to</b> have a child or not, men should also be able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether <b>to</b> assume {{paternity}} or not. Allowing men {{to have the opportunity}} to renounce the economic, social and legal responsibility for an unborn child during the first three months of pregnancy would give men and women as close to equal opportunities as possible. Just as women are able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether <b>to</b> have a child or not, men should also be able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether <b>to</b> assume paternity or not.|$|R

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E

They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors that they had <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought {{the death penalty for}} both Cisneros and Garza.

5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners have the option <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP {{will be required to}} be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E

On the July 8 episode of SmackDown, DiBiase teamed with Rhodes in a winning effort against the team of Bryan and Ezekiel Jackson. After DiBiase lost a match against Randy Orton on the August 26 episode of SmackDown, Rhodes attacked him, ending their association.|$|E
5|$|The Devil Children {{titles are}} {{role-playing}} {{games in which}} the player battles against demons. While the player controls a devil child, that character does not directly fight themselves; instead, they send in their allied demons {{to fight against the}} opponents. This was changed in Book of Fire and Book of Ice, where the devil children are able to fight by using cards. If one of the player's demons falls in battle, another is automatically sent in to take the first one's place. To recruit new demons to their party, the player needs <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> talk to the demon instead of fighting it, with the demon's response mostly being based on chance. The player can trade demons with other players, which is required to be able to collect all demon types. While the player's character gains experience points, their allied demons do not; to increase their power, the player needs to fuse their demons with each other.|$|E

5|$|Although born in Canada, Stastny is a dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States. Both {{he and his}} brother Yan have chosen to play internationally for the United States. Among the reasons that led him <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> play for the United States was the {{possibility}} to play in an international competition with his brother, who had chosen to play for the United States before Paul. Paul represented the U.S. {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Viking Cup, where he won a silver medal playing for the junior team. According to Hockey's Future, he was one of the most important American talents in the tournament. Stastny played internationally for the United States national ice hockey team for the first time in the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He played seven games, scored four goals and four assists, had two penalty minutes and finished even in plus/minus. The United States lost in the quarterfinals against Finland.
