40|$|Abstract. The {{electronic}} structure of a-Fe and V with H and C as impurities is calculated using the embedded-cluster {{model in the}} framework of self-consistent local-density theory. The results obtained reveal that charge transfer between the H atom and the host atoms is small, but the magnetic moments of neighbouring Fe atoms are reduced. The results of the total energy calculation show that H in a-Fe prefers to occupy <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site.</b> On the contrary, there is some charge transfer between the C atom and the host atoms. The distance between the C and nearest-neighbour Fe atoms is elongated 23 %. The interaction between the H and the C impurities was studied using a set of clusters of Fel 0 CH in which the atoms were located in five kinds of configuration. The energy of clusters with H on <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> is lower than that on the tetrahedral interstitial site. 1...|$|E

Along the [100] direction, the ideal tensile strength of vanadium doped with an O occupying <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> is 17. 4  GPa, which can be reduced by ∼ 8. 9 % compared to 19. 1  GPa of pure vanadium. This demonstrates that impurity O has a large effect on the tensile strength of vanadium. We further calculate the generalized fault energies including the unstable stacking energy (γus) and the cleavage energy (γcl) in pure vanadium and O-vanadium system in the most preferable { 110 } slip system. The cleavage energy can be decreased from 1. 705  J/m 2 of pure vanadium to 1. 681  J/m 2 of O-vanadium system and simultaneously the unstable stacking energy can be increased from 0. 308  J/m 2 of pure vanadium to 0. 325  J/m 2 of O-vanadium system. The ratio of γcl/γus alters from 5. 536 to 5. 172 and can be thus decreased by 6. 57 %.

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of hydrogen in hexagonal tungsten carbide (WC) {{is of particular interest}} for fusion reactor design due to the presence of WC in the divertor of fusion reactors. Therefore, we use first-principles calculations to study the hydrogen behavior in WC. The most stable interstitial site for the hydrogen atom is the projection of <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> on tungsten basal plane, followed by the site near the projection of <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> on carbon basal plane. The binding energy between two interstitial hydrogen atoms is negative, suggesting that hydrogen itself is not capable of trapping other hydrogen atoms to form a hydrogen molecule. The calculated results on the interaction between hydrogen and vacancy indicate that the hydrogen atom is energetically trapped by vacancy and the hydrogen molecule can not be formed in mono-vacancy. In addition, the hydrogen atom bound to carbon is only found in tungsten vacancy. We also study the migrations of hydrogen in WC and find that the interstitial hydrogen atom prefers to diffusion along the c axis. Our studies on the hydrogen behavior in WC provide some explanations for the experimental results of the thermal desorption process of energetic hydrogen ion implanted into WC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} distribution of carbon atoms in <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> of <b>the</b> face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of the iron-carbon system. The experimental part of the work consists of Mössbauer measurements in Fe-C alloys with up to about 12 atomic percent C, which are interpreted in terms of two alternative models for the distribution of C atoms in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> The theoretical part combines an analysis of the chemical potential of C based on the quasichemical approximation to the statistical mechanics of interstitial solutions, with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The latter were performed by assuming a gas like mixture of C atoms and vacancies (Va) in <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> <b>The</b> number of C-C, C-Va and Va-Va pairs calculated using Monte Carlo simulations are compared with those given by the quasichemical model.

Measurements were made on bulk powders and films {{with a variety of}} techniques including in-situ x-ray diffraction and monitoring of NH 3 pressure, Raman scattering and ac susceptibility. The reaction of NH 3 with K 3 C 60 is completely reversible and leaves the (C 60) 3 – charge state intact, while allowing the distance between the C 60 molecules to vary. We observe two different crystallographic structures at x = 1 and x = 8 – 10. The x = 1 structure is face-centered orthorhombic with a single NH 3 on <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site.</b> It is single phase at 100 °C and NH 3 pressures ≥ 400 torr and remains single phase at 0 torr if the temperature is reduced to 25 °C.

The details of the x = 8 – 10 structure are uncertain, however it appears that this phase is body-centered tetragonal with NH 3 on both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. It occurs at room temperature and NH 3 pressures ≥ 500 torr, but is not stable at lower NH 3 pressures.

40|$|In fusion environment, {{large amount}} of helium (He) atoms are {{produced}} by transmutation along with structural damage in the structural materials, causing materials swelling and degrading of physical properties. In this thesis, using first-principles method, I examined the microscopic mechanism of He trapping in vacancies and voids in structural materials (vanadium solid and 6 H–SiC composites). In vanadium, a single He atom located in the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) {{turned out to be}} more stable than that in <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> (OIS). Helium atoms were placed one by one into the vacancy defects (monovacancy and void) from the remote TISs, and we calculated the trapping energies as a function of the number of He atoms inside the vacancy defects. We found that, the monovacancy and void (about 0. 6 mn in diameter) can host up 18 and 66 He atoms, respectively, in vanadium solid. The induced internal pressure by He bubbles in monovacancy and small void increased up to 7. 5 GPa and 19. 3 GPa, respectively. In vacancy defect, the He–He equilibrium distances decreased with the amount of He atoms incorporated in monovacancy and small void, and the host lattice expanded dramatically. The atomic structures of selected He clusters trapped in vacancies were compared with the gas-phase clusters. In complex 6 H–SiC, there are ten kinds of interstitial sites for a single He atom. According to the calculated formation energy, the most stable site is the. R site. [1], where R site alternates with hexagonal interstitial sites. We explored the interactions between an interstital He atom and HenVam (Va stands for vacancy) clusters (n, m = 1 – 4). We found that the binding energy between He and the HenVam clusters increases with the number of vacancies (e. g., the binding energy is 1. 3 eV for He 2 Va 3, and 1. 7 eV for He 2 Va 4, respectively). The small void (about 0. 55 nm in diameter) in 6 H–SiC can accommodate up to 14 He atoms and the corresponding internal pressure is estimated to be 2. 5 GPa. The maximum density of He atoms in a small He bubble is about 50 atoms/nm 3, which is of the same magnitude as the experimental value 10 atoms/nm 3. Compared to vanadium, a small nanosized void in the 6 H–SiC host lattice has a weak tendency for trapping He. When trapped seventy He atoms in small void in vanadium, the nearest vanadium bond expands 22 – 28 %, and the volume of the void expands by 80 %. At the same time, with fourteen atoms encapsulated in a small void in 6 H–SiC, the local Si–C bonds explans 1 – 5 %, and the volume of the small void expands about 7 %. We suggest that the differences in the cohesive energies in these two systems are responsible for the different He trapping behavior. QC 20150126 </p...|$|E

They {{are used for}} aerospace, chemical, nuclear, industrial, biomedical, and consumer applications. Often, titanium components are subject to stresses for an extended time. It is known that single-phase hexagonally close-packed (HCP) alpha and body-centered cubic (BCC) beta-titanium alloys deform over time, or creep, at low temperatures (< 0. 25 *Tm). However, factors that affect creep behavior including microstructure and alloy chemistry are not well understood. The aim of this investigation is to experimentally and theoretically study the creep deformation behavior of single-phase alpha and beta-titanium alloys. 	 The {{first part of the}} investigation concerns alpha-Ti alloys. The low temperature creep behavior was studied experimentally, using alpha-Ti- 1. 6 wt. %V as the model alloy. Creep testing was performed at a range of temperatures and slip and twinning were identified as creep deformation mechanisms. The activation energy for creep was measured for the first time for an alpha-Ti than deforms by twinning. A change in activation energy during creep is explained by a model for twin nucleation caused by dislocation pileups. The theoretical aspect of the investigation concerns the phenomenon of slow twin growth (time-dependent twinning) during low temperature creep of alpha and beta-Ti alloys. This phenomenon is unusual and poorly understood as twins in bulk metals are expected to grow very fast. It was suggested that interstitial atoms, particularly oxygen could be responsible for time-dependent twinning but there were no models to explain this. As such, crystallographic models were developed for the HCP lattice of alpha-Ti and the BCC lattice of beta-Ti to show how <b>the</b> <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> where atoms such as oxygen can reside are eliminated by the atomic movements associated with twinning. As such, the rate of twin growth, and in turn the creep strain rate is controlled by the diffusion of oxygen away from these eliminated sites.

The environmental impact of these processes is huge so improvements {{must be made to}} current catalysts. Should a new material provide better yields at lower energy cost the benefits to both the industry and the planet are significant. There are many ways to change the behaviour of a catalyst, the addition of dopants, the selective blocking of active sites, and changing the strength of the support interaction to name a few. One technique that has become increasingly investigated is interstitial modification, the insertion of a light element into a metal lattice to change the metalâs catalytic properties. The work presented in this thesis devises greener synthetic routes to the known Pd- interstitial B/C catalyst and investigates potential routes to a novel interstitial material, Pd- interstitial Li/C. Initially, successful verification of interstitial modification comes from the characteristic increase in palladium lattice parameter from 3. 89 to 4. 00 Å and the blocking of the β-hydride formation. Initial catalytic screening determines the synthetic route which yields the most active catalyst which subsequently undergoes thorough characterisation. The wealth of evidence generated confirms the interstitial location of lithium within the palladium lattice, as well as adding to the current understanding of the Pd- interstitial B/C material. EELS analysis on Pd- interstitial B is the closest to direct observation of boron within the palladium lattice to date.

Zintl-Klemm concept would predict a limiting composition RE 5 Si 3 B 0. 6 for a valence compound and should then preclude the stoichiometric formula RE 5 Si 3 B. Density functional theory calculations carried out on some RE 5 Si 3 Zx systems for different interstitial heteroatoms Z and different x contents from 0 to 1 give some support to this statement...|$|R

40|$|The {{configuration}} of multiple hydrogen atoms {{trapped in a}} tungsten monovacancy is investigated using first-principles calculations to determine trapping energy. Unlike previous computational studies, which have reported that hydrogen in BCC metal monovacancies occupies <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites,</b> {{it is found that}} the stable sites shift towards tetrahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> as the number of hydrogen atoms increases. As a result, a maximum of twelve hydrogen atoms can become trapped in a tungsten monovacancy...|$|R

The ternary potentials accurately capture {{the heat of}} mixing and structural properties associated with solid solution alloys of palladium-silver. Stable hydrides are produced with properties that smoothly transition across the compositions. Additions of silver to palladium are predicted to alter {{the properties of the}} hydrides by decreasing the miscibility gap and increasing the likelihood of hydrogen atoms occupying tetrahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> over <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> Comment: Accepted by Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{behavior}} of 8 Li+ implanted into Platinum foil as revealed by β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR). At an applied field of 4. 1 T, a single resonance is observed, which is attributed to Li in an <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> temperature dependence of the Knight shift for this resonance is monitored at temperatures ranging from 4 to 300 K. Over this range the Knight shift {{is found to be}} linearily dependent on the temperature...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} energy, when all {{impurity}} atoms {{are on the}} same edge of an atomic cluster, their positions are more advantageous. The presence of nickel atoms {{on the edge of a}} cubic cluster resulted in decrease of potential barrier for a carbon atom and decrease in energy in the whole cluster. A similar drift of a carbon atom from central <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> to <b>the</b> surface in the direction < 011 > occurred under the influence of surface factors.|$|R
50|$|Solid {{buckminsterfullerene}} has small {{spaces between}} the C60 balls. Under 200 MPa pressure and 200 °C heat for 12 hours, argon can be intercalated into the solid to form crystalline Ar1C60. Once this cools down it is stable at standard conditions for months. Argon atoms occupy <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> <b>The</b> crystalline lattice size is almost unchanged at room temperature, but is slightly larger than pure C60 below 265 K. However argon does stop the buckyballs spinning below 250 K, a lower temperature than in pure C60.|$|R
40|$|Optically {{detected}} magnetic-resonance {{experiments on}} as-grown magnesium-doped GaN produced by metal-organic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} reveal {{the presence of a}} triplet state spectrum with a zero-field splitting that corresponds to a pair of centers, each with a spin of 1 / 2, strongly coupled by an exchange interaction and separated {{in the direction of the}} c axis by 0. 26 nm. The spectra show no resolved hyperfine structure, suggesting that the centers involve elements with zero nuclear spin. The separation of 0. 26 nm corresponds to the distance between two <b>octahedral</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> spectrum is due to an interstitial-interstitial pair, possibly involving magnesium and oxygen...|$|R
