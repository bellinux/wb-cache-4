Her friend Arthur Maynwaring wrote that she was more capable of business than any man. Although she never came to like Blenheim Palace – describing it as [...] "that great heap of stones" [...] – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the Duke of Somerset about the new waterworks: [...] "I {{believe it will be}} beautiful.

500|$|Commerce Square {{was praised}} for its design of two towers {{surrounding}} a plaza. The Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "Its most positive aspect {{is that it}} avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real urban place. It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in {{the whole idea of}} living in cities." [...] Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying [...] " [...] sensitivity for urban design is beautifully demonstrated by his design for the lobby level, including the splendid garden, of Commerce Square at 20th and Market streets, which I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> prove {{to be one of the}} finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ...|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, {{who had not}} served as writers since the season four season finale, wrote the script for the series finale. Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated: [...] "We wrote {{about what you want}} to have happen with people you love. I <b>think</b> <b>Will</b> and Grace end up very fleshed out. They end up as full adults. All the things that matter in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to see}} the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction. And the best way for their story to end is to find love." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast members}} of the show took the news about the show ending well. Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of {{being a part of}} {{something}} in history and I'm proud to have been given a platform to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously but now that it's over I take our collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales go. I think people will be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>Will</b> & Grace fans will be satisfied. Ultimately, [...] was done beautifully and it ties up loose ends for all of the characters in a way that's wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} several days, the Patriot forces mopped up the fleeing Loyalists. [...] In all, about 850 men were arrested. [...] Most of these were {{released}} on parole, but the ringleaders were sent to Philadelphia as prisoners. [...] Combined with the capture of the Loyalist camp at Cross Creek, the Patriots confiscated 1,500 muskets, 300 rifles, and $15,000 (as valued at the time) of Spanish gold. [...] Many of the weapons were probably hunting equipment, {{and may have been}} taken from people not directly involved in the Loyalist uprising. The action had a galvanizing effect on Patriot recruiting, and the arrests of many Loyalist leaders throughout North Carolina cemented Patriot control of the state. A pro-Patriot newspaper reported after the battle, [...] "This, we <b>think,</b> <b>will</b> effectually put a stop to loyalists in North Carolina". [...] Despite the hard feelings on both sides, the prisoners were treated with respect. [...] This helped convince many not to take up arms against the Patriots again.|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> be more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone already knew the outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
500|$|Going Commando was {{approved}} for development {{five months before}} the first game's release, after highly positive reviews from the original's playtesters. In August 2002, Insomniac Games started designing the visual concepts for Going Commando, while still fixing bugs in the original game. Brian Hastings, Insomniac's Vice President of Programming, said in a 2003 interview that {{the first step in}} the game's design was to [...] "try to come up with a few 'Big Ideas'. These are the things we <b>think</b> <b>will</b> really grab people's attention and give the game that Wow-Factor. In the case of Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando the big ideas were RPG elements (like weapon upgrades and health upgrades), spherical planets and space combat." [...] Hastings said that the inspiration for the game's spherical worlds came in part from the cover of the 1943 novel The Little Prince. Designing the spherical worlds required changing about 50,000 lines of the game's code, to account for the different handling of gravity. Development took a total of ten months, during which time Insomniac's design team doubled from 40 to 80 members.|$|E

500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we <b>think</b> <b>will</b> be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when I came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|Anorthosis and Rubin {{reached an}} {{agreement}} on 26 August. Kinkladze signed a contract {{until the end of}} the season, becoming the most decorated Georgian footballer to play in the Russian Premier League. He made his debut for Rubin the next day, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–2 defeat against FC Rostov. On a personal level the debut was a successful one; his corner kick was headed into the net by Vitalijs Astafjevs for Rubin's goal. He had less remarkable performances in the next two games and was substituted both times. This did not affect Berdyev's faith in him, and at a post-match press conference he defended Kinkladze: [...] "He needs time. He is an experienced player who, I <b>think,</b> <b>will</b> help the team." [...] The next game for Rubin was a 5–1 away win against low-ranked Terek Grozny, and Kinkladze made a considerable contribution to it, scoring two goals and making two assists. Against Tom Tomsk, he was less successful. Kinkladze missed a late penalty, denying Rubin a vital victory. After the match Berdyev claimed he made a mistake in his choice of penalty taker.|$|E
500|$|While {{researching the}} book, Taraborrelli {{realized}} {{that one of}} the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships. The opposite proved true; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable, and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy, and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic. Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty. The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna, and the relationship ended with her heart being broken. Taraborelli observed, [...] "So, what I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> surprise people with this story are the many times that Madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected. She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility. But at least in her personal life, and again, I make that distinction, because this isn't necessarily true in her business life, {{she is one of the}} most fragile subjects I've ever written about...This book is really about placing her life into the proper historical context, and once again answering the why questions about her." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I have ever heard. I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal {{holding the}} {{distribution}} rights to Hulk films {{may be an}} obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film, and reiterated this in October 2015, and July 2017. Marvel reacquired the film rights for the character, but Universal retained the distribution rights for The Incredible Hulk {{as well as the}} right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film. The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in , [...] and its untitled sequel, stating, [...] "we’ve worked a really interesting arc into Thor, Avengers and [...] for Banner that I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> – when it’s all added up – will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. The more I think about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is all the better for it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Authors of an {{ethnological study}} of slavery at Kingsley Plantation {{characterized}} Kingsley {{as a man}} of complex paradoxes, defiantly proud of his success as a slaveholder, yet dedicated to his multiracial family. Kingsley published a defense of slavery in 1828, identifying himself only as [...] "An Inhabitant of Florida". [...] He rationalized the institution as a necessary condition for any society, beneficial to owner and slave alike, and to the overall economy. He did not consider race the only factor that should determine servitude status, writing, [...] "Few, I <b>think</b> <b>will</b> deny that color and condition, if properly considered, are two very separate qualities ... our legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice." [...] In 1823 President James Monroe appointed Kingsley to Florida's Territorial Council, where he tried to persuade them to define the rights of free people of color. When it became apparent to him that they could not, he resigned. The council passed laws that increasingly restricted the rights which free blacks enjoyed under Spanish control. The treatise was Kingsley's response to these restrictions; he favored the Spanish three-tier system of white landowners, black slaves, and freed blacks. The pamphlet was reprinted again in 1834, and Southerners used its arguments to defend slavery in debates leading to the Civil War.|$|E
