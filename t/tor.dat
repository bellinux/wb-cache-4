5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the <b>Tor</b> before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the <b>Tor.</b> Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the <b>Tor.</b> This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the <b>Tor</b> was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E

40|$|For a finite-dimensional algebra A over a field k, we {{consider}} the complete lattice <b>tors</b> A of torsion classes. We introduce the brick labelling of its Hasse quiver {{and use it to}} study lattice congruences of <b>tors</b> A. In particular, we give a representation-theoretical interpretation of the so-called forcing order. When I is a two-sided ideal of A, <b>tors</b> (A/I) is a lattice quotient of <b>tors</b> A which is called an algebraic quotient, and the corresponding lattice congruence is called an algebraic congruence. The second part of this paper consists in studying algebraic congruences. We characterize the arrows of the Hasse quiver of <b>tors</b> A that are contracted by an algebraic congruence in terms of the brick labelling. In the third part, we study in detail the case of preprojective algebras Π, for which torsΠ is the Weyl group endowed with the weak order. In particular, we give a new proof of the isomorphism between <b>tors</b> k Q and the Cambrian lattice when Q is a Dynkin quiver, which is more representation theoretical. We also prove that, in type A, the algebraic quotients of torsΠ are exactly its Hasse-regular lattice quotients. Comment: 55 page...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tors</b> are landforms {{created by}} the erosion and {{weathering}} of rock; most commonly granites, but also schists, dacites, dolerites, coarse sandstones and others. <b>Tors</b> are mostly less than 5 m high. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain their origin and this remains a topic of discussion among geologists and geomorphologists, and physical geographers. It is considered likely that <b>tors</b> were created by geomorphic processes that differed widely in type and duration according to regional and local differences in climate and rock types.|$|R

Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near <b>Tor</b> Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|Carr {{returned}} to Ace Books in 1984 {{as a freelance}} editor, launching {{a new series of}} Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore, Lucius Shepard's Green Eyes, and Michael Swanwick's In the Drift. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre. Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start <b>Tor</b> Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at <b>Tor</b> and who eventually founded Baen Books.

40|$|Let Λ be a finite-dimensional {{associative}} algebra. The torsion {{classes of}} mod Λ form a lattice under containment, denoted by <b>tors</b> Λ. In this paper, we characterize the cover relations in <b>tors</b> Λ by certain indecomposable modules. We consider three applications: First, {{we show that}} the completely join-irreducible torsion classes (torsion classes which cover precisely one element) are in bijection with bricks. Second, we characterize faces of the canonical join complex of <b>tors</b> Λ in terms of representation theory. Finally, we show that, in general, the algebra Λ is not characterized by its lattice <b>tors</b> Λ. In particular, we study the torsion theory of a quotient of the preprojective algebra of type A_n. We show that its torsion class lattice is isomorphic to the weak order on A_n. Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
