5|$|The shred {{music of}} the 1980s was a major {{influence}} on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vinyl LP.|$|E

Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient.

40|$|We study a {{fluid flow}} {{traversing}} a porous medium and obeying the Darcy's {{law in the}} case when this medium is fractured by a periodical distribution of fissures filled with a Stokes fluid. These two flows are coupled by a Beavers-Joseph type interface condition. As <b>the</b> small period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution shrinks to zero, the resulting asymptotic behaviour is implicitely described by two underlying macroscopic quantities: <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stokes velocity and <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Darcy pressure, solutions of a new coupled system obtained by homogenization. <b>The</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macroscopic two-scale <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filtration velocity is given by an explicit two-scale Darcy type law, presenting coupling terms with <b>the</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Darcy pressure and with <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stokes velocity...|$|R

5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E

5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season.

Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017.

5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probable and journey through the impossible.

A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come along and protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E

Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the Nissei Theater in Tokyo, not long after it was opened in 1963.

Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. <b>The</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it.

As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E

Due largely to differing interpretations on <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus, over 270 species and varieties {{have been placed in}} Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species belong to Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names belong to species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|E
