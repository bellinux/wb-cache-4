25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others lose out, {{there is no guarantee that}} the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out, there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E
500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E

Peter Chapman of The Independent stated that Jacques was [...] "blessed with remarkable grace, delicacy and warmth, giving her an almost unique comic appeal". Sunday Life said that for decades she was [...] "Britain's favourite silly, sexually frustrated, fat woman". Nina Wadia of Goodness Gracious Me considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor to have [...] "paved the way for younger comediennes in Britain today", remarking that [...] "if {{it had not been}} for women like Hattie and Barbara, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> younger actresses would have any role model, or probably the ambition to do what they do".|$|E
