5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> were meant to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in the series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator {{pointed out that the}} women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of <b>the</b> <b>characters.</b> They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of <b>the</b> <b>characters.</b> The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
50|$|Character {{creation}} involves assigning {{points to}} seven statistics, or attributes: Agility (how physically able <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is), Endurance (how healthy and tough <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is), Intelligence (how well does <b>the</b> <b>character</b> learn, comprehend, remember, or know things), Perception (how aware <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is of their environment), Presence (how cool and intimidating <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is), Reflexes (how fast <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is), and Strength (how physically fit <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>character</b> first {{appears in}} April 2008 as the cellmate for <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of David Platt in the {{detention}} centre, {{and is a}} permanent feature in <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> scenes in <b>the</b> centre. He then last appears in June when David is released. After <b>the</b> <b>character</b> impressed bosses <b>the</b> <b>character</b> Graeme returned on 10 November 2008 on a permanent basis.|$|R
50|$|While active, <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> stamina will decrease. This is {{signified}} by <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> body gradually darkening. If <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> stamina is depleted, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> will transform into an ordinary domino, {{and the game}} will end. This is prevented by encountering on special Recovery Tiles that can recover <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> stamina, but can only be used once for each tile.|$|R
5|$|As he {{developed}} the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters {{as a basis for}} the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of <b>the</b> <b>characters,</b> a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. <b>The</b> <b>characters</b> that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (<b>the</b> <b>characters</b> Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E
5|$|Brotherhood {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV without the need to develop a series of games. The series was conceived by Ofuji in 2014, based on his wish to expand upon an in-game reference to the difficult childhood of one of <b>the</b> <b>characters.</b> The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E

50|$|Bleeding: <b>The</b> <b>character's</b> wound level. Bleeding {{increases}} as <b>the</b> <b>character</b> runs. Wounds slowly heal as <b>the</b> <b>character</b> stands still or walks. The higher the player's bleeding level is, <b>the</b> slower <b>the</b> <b>character</b> will move. Higher levels of bleeding will also affect <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> stamina. If <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is bleeding too much he/she will die from blood loss. If <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is bleeding a lot {{the heart rate}} drops below 50 until it reaches 0 or the bleeding heals. The Erole magazine is made for this purpose to stop the heart rate reaching 0 but only for this reason should you use it.|$|R
50|$|HP is <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> {{health and}} QP {{is the amount}} of energy <b>the</b> <b>character</b> has left. QP can be {{restored}} by drinking water. If <b>the</b> <b>character</b> becomes thirsty from running or other strenuous tasks, the player must provide <b>the</b> <b>character</b> with drinking water. If the player does not do this, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> begins to slowly lose health. Water can be drunk from clean taps or from bottled water filled up along the way. It is possible to give <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> companion water.|$|R

5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characters</b> and {{graphics}} received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found <b>the</b> <b>characters,</b> up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>character</b> {{advances}} to an underwater cavern, where raptors and stegosaurs are encountered {{and must be}} captured or avoided. <b>The</b> <b>character</b> then discovers a steep ravine and is knocked over a cliff by a Pteranodon. <b>The</b> <b>character</b> climbs <b>the</b> cliff, jumping over many gaps while avoiding pterosaurs. At the top of <b>the</b> cliff, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> escapes baby pteranodons and a Tyrannosaurus rex. The T. rex then chases <b>the</b> <b>character</b> and falls down a pit after it crosses an unstable bridge, but survives. <b>The</b> <b>character</b> goes into <b>the</b> jungle and avoids additional dinosaurs, before going down a waterfall.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the player}} wished {{a radical change}} in <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> abilities, a [...] "Re-Spec" [...] button was {{available}} on <b>the</b> <b>Character</b> Sheet. This allowed the player to completely redistribute <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> attribute points at any time by spending some of <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> gold. <b>The</b> charge for a Re-Spec was based on <b>the</b> <b>character's</b> level and was inexpensive up to level 20, after which the price increased much more quickly per level. The final level cap was 100.|$|R
5000|$|Filial piety is {{illustrated}} by <b>the</b> Chinese <b>character</b> xiao (孝). <b>The</b> <b>character</b> {{is a combination of}} <b>the</b> <b>character</b> lao (old) above <b>the</b> <b>character</b> zi (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son. In Korean Confucianism, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> [...] is pronounced hyo (효). In Vietnamese, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> [...] is written in Quoc Ngu as hiếu.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characters</b> in {{the games}} have been the basis of several pieces of {{merchandise}} produced by Square Enix, such as statues, action figures, apparel, and jewelry. They {{have been subject to}} mostly positive reviews; most observers favorably compared <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> to those in the previous games and praised the voice acting, however some critics have stated that the plot line of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> have been confusing when introduced. In XIII-2, the shift to new or secondary characters and the change in importance and story role of the previous game's main cast grated with some reviewers, while others applauded the new characters' development and interactions. In Lightning Returns, the characters' stories were often criticized for being underdeveloped, or simply included for the sake of ending their stories.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characters</b> of Sam and Max {{were created}} in Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave {{originally}} came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with <b>the</b> <b>characters.</b> In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>characters</b> were {{similarly}} well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
