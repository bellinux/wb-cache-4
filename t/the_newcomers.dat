5|$|As the {{war began}} to draw to a close, the ships of Battleship Division Nine {{remained}} busy. With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet. The average spread for the whole division, including <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> Texas and Arkansas, was now less than , which was much better than previously, if still {{not as good as}} the British average.|$|E
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that {{this might have been}} a way for <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also {{suggests that}} it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|In 1522, Spanish ships {{explored}} the Pacific shore of Chiapas when Andrés Niño followed the coast from Panama northwest to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In December that year, Cuzcacuatl, who was {{lord of the}} Tzotzil Maya town of Zinacantan, travelled to the Spanish settlement at Villa del Espíritu Santo (modern Coatzacoalcos) to pledge an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>newcomers.</b>|$|E
30|$|In Chord, after hashing <b>the</b> <b>newcomer’s</b> IP {{address and}} {{generating}} its nodeId, the system relies on some external mechanism to introduce <b>the</b> <b>newcomer</b> to an existing node in the overlay. Afterwards, the existing node will generate a lookup message {{to find the}} successor of <b>the</b> <b>newcomer</b> based on its generated nodeId. <b>The</b> <b>newcomer</b> will then connect to its successor and join the overlay. CAN {{on the other hand}} assumes the existence of a domain name server that maintains the addresses of bootstrapping nodes which hold partial lists of available nodes in the overlay. In order to join <b>the</b> overlay, <b>the</b> <b>newcomer</b> has first to obtain the address of one of the bootstrapping nodes. Later, <b>the</b> <b>newcomer</b> contacts this node in order to retrieve a list of randomly selected available nodes. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>newcomer</b> sends a join request to one of those nodes which accordingly splits its zone in half and assigns it to <b>the</b> <b>newcomer.</b>|$|R

5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to <b>the</b> <b>newcomers.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. <b>The</b> <b>newcomers</b> {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E
5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> to insist on meeting them under the open sky, {{to prevent them from}} performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Newcomer</b> in <b>The</b> Cabbage (Пришелец в капусте) is a 1989 short Soviet Russian stop-motion {{animation}} film by Vladimir Danilevich. It is {{the first}} film of a tetralogy about the adventures of <b>The</b> <b>Newcomer</b> Vaniusha and his friends. It was followed by Vaniusha <b>The</b> <b>Newcomer,</b> Vaniusha and <b>The</b> Space Pirate and Vaniusha and The Giant.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Newcomer</b> Award {{was divided}} into two Breakthrough Awards, one for Acting, the other for Filmmaking. Previously filmmakers and actors had competed against each other for <b>the</b> <b>Newcomer</b> award.|$|R

5|$|Long before {{non-indigenous}} people {{explored the}} region, tribes of Native Americans fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19thcentury fur trappers and explorers including Lewis and Clark visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. <b>The</b> <b>newcomers</b> farmed, cut timber, built houses, {{and by the}} early 20thcentury established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines and industries near the slough. Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area. A flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, which was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E
5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution as a work of conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
5|$|With its {{connection}} through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi {{to the south}} and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to <b>the</b> <b>newcomers,</b> adopting nativist sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to free states caused it to become a center for the filing of freedom suits. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the Dred Scott case, interpretations had changed and the US Supreme Court ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the American Civil War. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under Union control.|$|E
5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with <b>the</b> <b>newcomers,</b> but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E

5|$|The Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{ended the}} American Revolution and {{established}} the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River {{and within the}} first year after it was signed 50,000American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As it was difficult to return east across the mountains, the settlers began looking toward the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed <b>the</b> <b>newcomers.</b> A drought made rangeland scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|Daimler hated {{having to}} {{incorporate}} his company. Unable to obtain majority control, he sold {{out and then}} resigned.

25|$|Even {{though he}} was {{somewhat}} smaller and darker than the blond, blue-eyed Maywald, he looked very handsome in his fur-collared uniform coat and seemed every inch an officer and a gentleman. It never occurred to <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> to suspect such a man of being a murderer.|$|E

25|$|A small steady {{immigration}} for Poland {{has taken}} place since 1939. Political refugees arrived after the war. In the 1980s about 34,000 refugees arrived fleeing Communism in Poland, along with 29,000 regular immigrants. Most of <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> were well-educated professionals, artists of political activists and typically did not settle in the long-established neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{came about}} when <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> {{displayed}} {{a lack of}} respect for Aboriginal marriage rules, stole bones and other artefacts and desecrated sites important to the Aboriginals. This produced a period of conflict through the 1830s, sometimes followed up by reprisals with guns, during which a number of Aboriginal people were massacred.|$|E
25|$|The first {{conflicts}} between Europeans and aboriginal peoples {{may have occurred}} around 1000 CE, when parties of Norsemen attempted to establish permanent settlements along the northeastern coast of North America (see L'Anse aux Meadows). According to Norse sagas, the skraelings of Vinland responded so ferociously that <b>the</b> <b>newcomers</b> eventually withdrew and gave up their plans to settle the area.|$|E
