5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
25|$|When the Official Opposition has {{exhausted}} {{its initial}} three questions, the lead questioners {{of the other}} officially-recognized opposition parties are permitted an initial question and one supplementary question each, in order of size. Given {{the composition of the}} current 42nd Canadian Parliament, once the Official Opposition, the Conservative Party, is finished, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> comes from the only other officially-recognized opposition party, the New Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E

25|$|Double Dip (x2): This {{lifeline}} {{was introduced}} in season 3. By using this lifeline the candidate has the option to choose two answers for a single question. When this lifeline is used the timer is stopped and the candidate has to lock his/her first answer. If it is right the candidate can proceed to play for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> If wrong the candidate {{will be given a}} second chance to lock another answer while the timer is started again. On the use of this lifeline the candidate is not allowed to use any other lifelines. He or she is also not allowed to quit the game when this lifeline is used.|$|E
25|$|The Finals {{was played}} {{the same way}} as the Elimination Round, except with single {{contestant}}s. The contestant who had more points when time ran out won the game and played the Solo Game for a chance at a cash jackpot. In the first show of the series, in the finals, the contestant who scored blocked the other contestant and would be allowed to keep answering questions until he/she missed one. If the other contestant then guessed right, that person took control. If both contestants missed the answer, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was a toss-up to determine control. After the first episode, this format was abandoned and all words were played as toss-ups.|$|E

He then received the kiss of peace from both the priests, and Father André exclaimed in French, [...] "Alors, allez au ciel!" [...] meaning [...] "so, to heaven!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{hot seat}} {{contestant}} had only fifteen seconds to answer {{each of the}} first five questions (100-1,000 points), thirty seconds per <b>question</b> for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five <b>questions</b> (2,000-32,000 points), forty-five seconds for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four <b>questions</b> (64,000-500,000 points), and fifty-five seconds for the final million-point question; the real show internationally carried a variation of this format from 2008-2010.|$|R

500|$|In {{the event}} that a {{contestant}} leaves and very little time remains (in the final part of an episode), a randomly selected audience member is given one chance to win $1,000 by answering <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> intended for the previous contestant (or $2,000 if <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> was on a Double Money episode). Regardless of the outcome, the audience member receives a special prize. In seasons nine and ten, the prize was {{a copy of the}} Millionaire video game; as of season eleven, audience members now receive 20 free playings for a Facebook game based on the show's format. In season thirteen, which gave this game the name [...] "Thousandaire", the question the audience player faced did not come from the previous player's stack, but was instead a separate question. Two additional audience games were also introduced and played in season thirteen: [...] "Team Millionaire", where two audience members are both presented with a single question and lock in their individual answers separately for the chance to win $500 and a bonus question with which they can double their money; and [...] "Fastest Feet", a variation of Fastest Finger which four audience members play for the chance to split $1,000.|$|E
500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> is whether the patient can respond {{in a meaningful way}} to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. [...] A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be [...] "alert and oriented times four" [...] (sometimes denoted [...] "A" [...] on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.|$|E
500|$|A much {{different}} {{origin of the}} song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck {{with him for a}} bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang [...] "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question.</b> Martin applauded Stern saying [...] "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} month, {{a controversy}} arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% — a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%, used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP. One local analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] The report's methodology was criticised for using market value instead of par value for its calculations of equity, and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies. It also included government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned companies. Some, however, criticised the government, alleging that par value did not accurately reflect {{the value of the}} enterprises studied, and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra-held. The report was later withdrawn, but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30% mark in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|The show's host asks each {{contestant}} {{a number}} of multiple-choice questions. Of the four options only one is correct. Players answer correctly to win an amount of money. They are then shown <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> and four answers. Successive questions are worth a greater sum of money. In most cases this is double the previous sum. Players who answer question numbers five and ten correctly {{find themselves in a}} situation where their winnings are [...] "safe". This means they will not lose their winnings under any circumstances. This allows the players to hazard a guess for question six and question eleven. Players answering a question incorrectly are eliminated from the game and their winnings return to the previous [...] "safe" [...] amount.

2500|$|In 2006, a major dispute arose {{when the}} Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% – a stark {{difference}} from the official figure of 18.9%. The report's publication triggered a relatively vocal public debate {{about the status of}} the NEP and its related policies, with many from UMNO questioning the methodology used by ASLI. One strongly disputed issue was ASLI's decision to consider government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned, inflating the calculated figure of Bumiputra equity. Although ASLI later withdrew the report, citing unspecified errors in its methodology, the debate did not die down. One political analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question</b> is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] Others have argued that the debate over inter-ethnic disparities has obscured intra-ethnic inequities, citing the increased Gini coefficient for Bumiputras (from 0.433 in 1999 to 0.452 in 2004), Chinese (0.434 to 0.446) and Indians (0.413 to 0.425).|$|E
2500|$|In {{an email}} debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI's November 2000 {{translation}} {{of an interview}} given by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to Al-Ahram al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How {{do you deal with}} the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How {{do you feel about the}} Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out the first part of the reply and combined it with the answer to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>question,</b> which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we seek to}} raise {{questions}} about the nature of number agreement in the grammars of young children, whether they are learning languages poor in number agreement (African American English (AAE)), relatively simple (Mainstream American English (MAE)) or inherently complex (Xhosa).
