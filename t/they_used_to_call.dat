40|$|Study on the {{socio-cultural}} aspects {{in relation}} to filariasis transmission dynamics {{was carried out in}} the transmigration area of Kumpeh, Iambi. In this study a number of 266 respondents originated from Java were interviewed. Beside interview by using questionnaires, focus group discussions and observation were also implemented. From this study it was known that the word "filariasis" seemed to be unpopular among the transmigrants. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>called</b> the disease untut or penyakit kaki gajah. A great number of the respondents stated that the disease is transmitted through mosquito bites, but they did not know the mode of the transmission. A small number of the respondents were of the opinion that the disease was hereditary and this knowledge was adopted from the local inhabitants. The attitude of the respondents towards filariasis control measures was positive, and it was shown among others, by their willingness to be bled for filariasis examination. Their behaviour in its connection with filariasis transmission was not supportive towards filariasis control e. g. <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> stay in the ladang, and chat outdoor during the night without protection against mosquito bites. From this study it was also known that they exposed themselves to the mosquito bites mainly in the ladang when they take guard of their crops from pests damages. Their low education affected their perception towards filariasis and will hamper health education on filariasis control. </p...|$|R
