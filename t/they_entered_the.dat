40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} market segmentation on firm competitiveness. We study a simultaneous move game of entry and pricing in a market with various consumer segments of different profitability. If the market is not segmented, or if firms are unable to <b>enter</b> at <b>the</b> segment level and can only <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> entire market, then a unique zero-profit equilibrium exists. By contrast, if firms can enter different segments and also the entire market, then firms can obtain positive profits. Thus, segmentation substantially alters the way the market functions. In equilibrium firms behave very aggressively when <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> most profitable segment, quite gently when <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> least profitable segment and moderately aggressive when <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> entire market.
