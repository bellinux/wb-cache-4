5000|$|In {{land-line}} telephony, AIOD leads are Terminal equipment leads used {{solely to}} transmit automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) {{data from a}} PBX to the {{public switched telephone network}} or to switched service networks (e.g., EPSCS), so that a vendor can provide a detailed monthly bill identifying long distance calling usage by individual PBX stations, <b>tie</b> <b>trunks,</b> or the attendant console. [...] It resembles common channel signalling in that the AIOD leads provide data for all trunks, but is used only for billing, thus resembling automatic number identification.|$|R
50|$|From its {{beginnings}} in 1876 {{and throughout the}} first part of the 20th century, the Bell System grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by growing their subscriber bases, as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with <b>tie</b> <b>trunks.</b> It was the responsibility of each local administration to design telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth. As a result, the Bell System as a whole developed into an unorganized system of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various numbering plans in existence and developed the North American Numbering Plan as a unified, systematic approach to efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.|$|R

50|$|The right panel {{shows the}} {{traditional}} Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, although {{in this case}} the saint is depicted in a rather contorted position which likely derived from Michelangelo's Punishment of Aman in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or from Raphael's Fire of Borgo also in the Vatican. The arms are <b>tied</b> to a <b>trunk</b> at different heights, while the legs are also differently articulated due to the presence of a column section.|$|R
50|$|Elephants {{were further}} {{enhanced}} {{with their own}} weaponry and armour. In India and Sri Lanka, heavy iron chains with steel balls at the end were <b>tied</b> to the <b>trunks</b> of war elephants, which the animals were trained to swirl menacingly and with great skill. Numerous cultures designed elephant armour, aiming to protect the body and legs of the animal while leaving his trunk free to attack the enemy. Tusk swords were sometimes employed. Larger animals could also carry a protective tower on their backs, called a howdah.|$|R

Later he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald <b>ties</b> a large <b>trunk</b> with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.|$|R
60|$|At Padua {{we take a}} {{carriage}} for Ponte Lagoscuro, and having fought the customary battle with the vetturino before arriving at the terms of contract; having submitted to the successive pillage {{of the man who}} had held our horses a moment, of the man who <b>tied</b> on the <b>trunk,</b> and of the man who hovered obligingly about the carriage, and desired to drink our health--with prodigious smacking of whip, and banging of wheels, we rattle out of the Stella d'Oro, and set forth from the gate of the old city.|$|R

In a corner of the seat, was a very small deal <b>trunk,</b> <b>tied</b> round with a scanty piece of cord; and on the trunk was perched--his lace-up half-boots and corduroy trousers dangling in the air--a diminutive boy, with his shoulders drawn up to his ears, and his hands planted on his knees, who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster, from time to time, with evident dread and apprehension.|$|R

50|$|Mabel Collins {{was born}} in St Peter Port, Guernsey. She was a writer of popular occult novels, a fashion writer and an anti-vivisection campaigner. According to Vittoria Cremers, as related by Aleister Crowley, Collins was at one time being romantically pursued by both Cremers and alleged occultist Robert D'Onston Stephenson. Cremers claimed that during this time she found five blood-soaked <b>ties</b> in a <b>trunk</b> under Stephenson's bed, {{corresponding}} to the five murders committed in Whitechapel by Jack the Ripper. Stephenson {{is no longer a}} candidate for Jack the Ripper due to the efforts of modern researchers. However, Stephenson was a rival of Cremers for Collins' affections, and this account cannot be independently confirmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{rooms are}} bigger than in other caves in the region, and many are two storied. Here lived a whole town. The {{foundation}} of this complex is a well-built stone trench; many of the rooms have walls and ceiling black by soot, although there are kind of chimneys. In {{one of the rooms}} the construction techniques for the first level ceiling can be appreciated, they used táscate and pine tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>tied</b> together and covered with clay. This holds the second floor and is supported by a pretty thick trunk, all blackened by soot. The room on the second floor is spacious and has a little room, as if used for children.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{considered}} for a moment, saw her way clear, and nodded again. They spent the evening putting away well-remembered civilian suits, underclothes that Mary had marked, and the regiments of very gaudy socks and <b>ties.</b> A second <b>trunk</b> was needed, and, after that, a little packing-case, and it was late next day when Cheape and the local carrier lifted them to the cart. The Rector luckily knew of a friend's son, about five feet {{eight and a half}} inches high, to whom a complete Flying Corps outfit would be most acceptable, and sent his gardener's son down with a barrow to take delivery of it. The cap was hung up in Miss Fowler's bedroom, the belt in Miss Postgate's; for, as Miss Fowler said, they had no desire to make tea-party talk of them.|$|R
30|$|By 2017 this site, too, had changed, but not {{its status}} as a ritual place. The toran was gone. Ritual {{attention}} had shifted to the tree behind the earlier upright stone, which was marked with a series of tipna. A red thread was <b>tied</b> around its <b>trunk,</b> and several thin wooden poles, surmounted by orange flags, leaned against it. A stone, similar in shape to the memorial stone and covered with tipna (perhaps it was the same stone), was now lying flat on {{the ground in front of}} the tree along a line parallel to the path. It was flanked on either side by many small dhaba and horses, and in front of it was a small charred area where we offered the livers of the chickens that we had killed on the summit of the hill.|$|R
2500|$|On January 18, 2012, SPRB Arquitectos, a Jalisco-based {{architecture}} {{group led}} by Laura Sánchez Penichet and Carlos Rodríguez Bernal, won a contest sponsored by the International Hotel Awards and Bloomberg Television in London. They won the award for helping redesign Hotelito Desconocido's interior design and external architecture; the award granted Hotelito Desconocido a five-star status, and was voted by the contest organizers as the best hotel in terms of architecture in Mexico and Latin America for the 2011–2012 edition. Among the contest judges were employees from Google, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bloomberg Television, among others. The two Mexican architects explained that their work at Hotelito Desconocido started in 2009 after the owners recognized that the hotel needed a major reconstruction. Since the hotel was initially built using the [...] model, which uses guayabillo <b>trunks</b> <b>tied</b> together and compressed with mud, the owners decided to demolish the original construction and build the hotel on palafittes. In the original model, the architects explained that Hotelito Desconocido's rooms were exactly the same (in terms of size and interior design) {{and did not have}} specific themes like the new models did. For the landscape design, they kept the agave and fruit gardens; they decided to change the look of the entrance and beach by adding 200 palm trees. They also added additional gardens and new sand.|$|R
60|$|Even {{as things}} {{stand at the}} present day, however, it is {{wonderful}} how much use we modern Englishmen now make in our own houses of this far Eastern nut, whose very name still bears upon its face the impress of its originally savage origin. From morning to night we never leave off being indebted to it. We wash with it as old brown Windsor or glycerine soap the moment we leave our beds. We walk across our passages on the mats made from its fibre. We sweep our rooms with its brushes, and wipe our feet on it as we enter our doors. As rope, it <b>ties</b> up our <b>trunks</b> and packages; {{in the hands of}} the housemaid it scrubs our floors; or else, woven into coarse cloth, it acts as a covering for bales and furniture sent by rail or steamboat. The confectioner undermines our digestion in early life with coco-nut candy; the cook tempts us later on with coco-nut cake; and Messrs. Huntley and Palmer cordially invite us to complete the ruin with coco-nut biscuits. We anoint our chapped hands with one of its preparations after washing; and grease the wheels of our carriages with another to make them run smoothly. Finally, we use the oil to burn in our reading lamps, and light ourselves at last to bed with stearine candles. Altogether, an amateur census of a single small English cottage results in the startling discovery that it contains twenty-seven distinct articles which owe their origin in one way or another to the coco-nut palm. And yet we affect in our black ingratitude to despise the question of the milk in the coco-nut.|$|R
5000|$|The Countess of Derwentwater is a character. Recently {{she took}} a steamer at Jersey City for Liverpool, and the goods she carried with her wore thus {{inventoried}} :-One guitar, with two strings two old cane-seated chairs, one with two legs three empty four-gallon demijohns, uncorked two peacocks and a black-and-tan, in a box two broken children's cribs of mahogany, one without rockers one cross-breed hound of English birth one champagne bucket, covered with dust one broken painter's easel three rickety deckchairs, with varnish scraped off; one bag of tin ware; one six by three pedestal, without statuette, cracked four plain square Irish chests, two painted rod and two black, locks broken and hanging, each marked in white letters, [...] " [...] Countess D."

The Countess wore on this occasion a green silk dress, a white crape shawl, a pair of white silk gloves, etc. When the labourers {{took hold of the}} box containing the lady's favourite peacocks and the black-and-tan, the curious crowd pressed down on the countess until her lace-trimmed bonnet took a peep skyward, and her costly shawl swept the rough boards of the pier. “Handle 'em gently; they’re my only loves !" [...] she sharply cried, as she broke through the jeering crowd, and reached the foot of the gang plank. [...] "This remarkable woman," [...] says the Suit, “has a fine estate in the north of England, in the county of Cumberland, called Derwentwater. She has always been noted for her eccentric manner and antiquated notions. Her wardrobe is said to consist of over two hundred rich and elaborately trimmed dresses, girted with gold lace, fringes, and parti-colored velvets. She wears no diamonds, and but one plain finger ring adorns her hands. She claims to have among her apparel robes worn by some of the belles of the time of William the Conqueror, and when she travels, those are part of her personal luggage, carefully packed in the fifteen trunks mentioned, which are as antiquated as the dresses. Her appearance indicates an age not beyond forty, though possibly older. She will visit Scotland and Wales before returning to her home." ...|$|R
