500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went looking for this dude to kick his ass. Nobody was going to replace Duane and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it and really, I don't want to see her.

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the Orthodox Ukrainian {{population}} in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending {{the rights of the}} Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had stronger representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Catholic Church. During the Polish rule, 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (although some of them have already been abandoned) and 150 were forcibly transformed into Catholic (not Ukrainian Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would [...] "destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> any possibility of reunion." ...|$|E

He being dead, they cannot assume new forms of beauty in any future poems, and cannot be thus diffused from mind to mind, but they remain mourning round their deceased herdsman, or master. It is possible that this image of a flock and a herdsman is consequent upon the phrase in the Elegy of Moschus for Bion--'Bion the herdsman is dead' (p. 65).|$|R
60|$|I caused Friday {{to gather}} all the skulls, bones, flesh, and {{whatever}} remained, and lay {{them together in}} a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes.

David by this could guess at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> God towards him (Psa 40:5). And thus it was with the woman of Canaan; she did by faith and a right understanding discern, beyond all the rough carriage of Christ, tenderness and willingness in his heart to save, which caused her to be vehement and earnest, yea, restless, until she did enjoy the mercy she stood in need of (Matt 15:22-28).|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, Paul {{was one of}} {{only seven}} Republicans to vote against a bill which, if passed, would have made {{performing}} or pressuring a woman into having a sex-selective abortion, or transporting a woman into the country or across state lines for the purpose of undergoing such an abortion, a federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. The bill would also have subjected nurses and other healthcare workers to fines and possible imprisonment for failing to report suspected violations of the law. Paul explained that although he found <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> sex-selective abortions revolting, he could not support the measure because it would be unconstitutional and would create [...] "yet another set of federal criminal laws, even though the Constitution lists only three federal crimes: piracy, treason, and counterfeiting." [...] He urged advocates of abortion bans to seek instead to repeal Roe v. Wade and allow abortion regulation to be handled at the state level.|$|E

6000|$|Fourth. Thy {{fear that}} Christ will not receive thee, {{may arise from}} a sense of the {{exceeding}} mercy of being saved; sometimes salvation is in the eyes of him that desires so great, so huge, so wonderful a thing, that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excellency of it, engenders unbelief about obtaining it, in the heart of those that unfeignedly desire it. [...] "Seemeth it to you," [...] saith David, [...] "a light thing to be a king's son-in-law?" [...] (1 Sam 18:23). So the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> the greatness and glory of the thing propounded, as heaven, eternal life, eternal glory, to be with God, and Christ, and angels; these are great things, things too good, saith the soul that is little in his own eyes; things too rich, saith the soul that is truly poor in spirit, for me.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{resolved}} on {{a desperate}} course, and {{told my mother}} my resolution, viz. that, in short, I would tell him of it myself.

I told her I did not question but, if I could be hypocrite enough to feign more affection to him than I really had, I should succeed in all my design, and we might part by consent, and with a good agreement, for I might live him well enough for a brother, though I could not for a husband.|$|R

60|$|While I {{was in this}} disguise, I fell in with {{a parcel}} of folks of a worse kind than any I ever sorted with, and I saw a little into their ways too. These were coiners of money, and they made some very good offers to me, as to profit; but the part {{they would have had}} me have {{embarked}} in was the most dangerous part. I mean that of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> working <b>the</b> die, as they call it, which, had I been taken, had been certain death, and that at a stake--I say, to be burnt to death at a stake; so that though I was to appearance but a beggar, and they promised mountains of gold and silver to me to engage, yet it would not do. It is true, if I had been really a beggar, or had been desperate as when I began, I might perhaps have closed with it; for what care they to die that can't tell how to live? But at present this was not my condition, at least I was for no such terrible risks as those; besides, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> being burnt at a stake struck terror into my very soul, chilled my blood, and gave me the vapours to such a degree, as I could not think of it without trembling.|$|R
6000|$|... (3.) The {{strength}} of this desire shows itself in this also, namely, {{in that it is}} willing to grapple with the king of terrors, rather than to be detained from that sweet communion that the soul looks for when it comes into the place where its Lord is. Death is not to be desired for itself; the apostle chose rather to be clothed upon with his house which is from heaven, 'that mortality might be swallowed up of life' (2 Cor 5:1-4). But yet, rather than he would be absent from the Lord, he was willing to be absent from the body. Death, in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> it, is grievous to flesh and blood; and nothing can so master it in our apprehensions as that by which we attain to these desires. These desires do deal with death, as Jacob's love to Rachel did deal with the seven long years which he was to serve for her. It made them seem few, or but a little time; now so, I say, doth these desires deal with death itself. They make it seem little, nay, a servant, nay, a privilege; for that, by that a man may come to enjoy the presence of his beloved Lord. 'I have a desire to depart,' to go from the world and relations, to go from my body, that great piece of myself; I have a desire to venture the tugs and pains, and the harsh handling of the king of terrors, so I may be with Jesus Christ! These are desires of the righteous.|$|R
