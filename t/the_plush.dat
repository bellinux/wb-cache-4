5|$|The {{character}} of the Vortigaunt has been popular enough to inspire {{the creation of a}} Vortigaunt plush toy. The toy was designed by Dhabih Eng and was sold and distributed via Valve's online store. The toy was released in December 2006 and due to the proximity to Christmas, the Vortigaunt was accompanied by a to-scale Santa Claus hat. Reviews of <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> toy were favorable, praising the toy as sturdy, as well as giving credit for its articulation and detail.|$|E
5|$|As {{they enter}} the room, the man stands up and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him fall to the ground. As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E

25|$|While Goodfellow {{lived in}} Tombstone, {{he was a}} founder in 1880 of <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> Tombstone Club located {{on the second floor}} of the Ritchie Building. The rooms were {{furnished}} with reading tables and chairs. The 60 male members had access to more than 70 publications. He also helped organize the Tombstone Scientific Society. He was active in other community affairs, and invested in the Huachuca Water Company, which in 1881 built a -long pipeline from the Huachuca Mountains to Tombstone, along with a community swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} that Boris needed correction due to Mussorgsky's poverty of technique prompted Rimsky-Korsakov to revise it after his death. His edition supplanted the composer's Revised Version of 1872 in Russia, and launched the work abroad, remaining the preferred edition for some 75 years (see Versions by Other Hands {{in this article}} for more details). For decades, critics and scholars pressing {{for the performance of}} Mussorgsky's own versions fought an often losing battle against the conservatism of conductors and singers, who, raised on <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> Rimsky-Korsakov edition, found it impossible to adapt to Mussorgsky's comparatively unrefined and bleak original scores.|$|E
25|$|The {{poet and}} {{journalist}} Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered {{the place in}} upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked {{his life and his}} training up to that point.|$|E
60|$|It was pitiable to see {{the other}} poor Johns slink off at this arrival! Not one of <b>the</b> honest private <b>Plushes</b> could stand up before the Royal Flunkeys. They left the walk: they sneaked into dark holes and drank their beer in silence. <b>The</b> Royal <b>Plush</b> kept {{possession}} of the garden until <b>the</b> Royal <b>Plush</b> dinner was announced, when it retired, and we heard from the pavilion where they dined, conservative cheers, and speeches, and Kentish fires. The other Flunkeys we never saw more.|$|R

Mendoza also praised the revamp of her image and described her as [...] " [...] sizzling in new shots".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Willamette Week, Ben Waterhouse {{asserted}} that the restaurant had changed little since its establishment. Waterhouse stated [...] "time travel" [...] was Country Bill's form of entertainment, noting its red vinyl booths, wood paneling and [...] "white-haired" [...] clientele. He recommended ordering beer or spirits (specifically Anchor Steam) as opposed to cocktails, which he found contained too much sugar. Mix magazine reviewed Country Bill's as one of [...] "five vintage restaurants that have {{stood the test of}} time". In his review, Michael Russell described CB's Lounge's red clamshell booths, electric candles and the servers [...] "who alternate between alarmingly fresh-faced and downright sassy". Russell recommended the hand-cut garlic French fries and deep fried cheesecake, which he described as [...] "country-fair gluttony incarnate". The Portland Mercury also described the restaurant's retro features such as <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> red booths, mood lighting and metallic wallpaper. The publication also noted the older waiting staff.|$|E
500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard reports of irregularities in the Travel Office and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire the Travel Office staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House director of administration David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that the Travel Office had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within the Travel Office had alleged financial improprieties; the Reagan White House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the main television series, Perry has appeared in several pieces of Phineas and Ferb merchandise. To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. The character has been adapted into a 20inch plush toy, released by The Walt Disney Company. <b>The</b> <b>plush</b> has a button on its hand that allows it to emit Perry's signature chattering noise. Certain t-shirts based on the series released by both Disney and the online retail website Zazzle also display Perry and the phrase [...] "Hey, where's Perry?" [...] which most characters like Phineas, Isabella, Stacy, Irving, Ferb, and Lawrence utter when Perry goes to Major Monogram in his secret lair in almost every episode. There also is a T-Shirt with Perry's face. Perry appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb, where a mini-game involves Perry stopping Doofenshmirtz's latest evil scheme. As of 1 April 2014, Perry is also a playable character in the video game Disney Infinity. He also appears in the [...] episode [...] "Double Trouble".|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're {{going to have to change}} this floor".|$|E

However, the roadster concept was soon altered to <b>the</b> <b>plusher</b> Sportabout as higher comfort levels were demanded by the post-war auto buyers. 9325 roadsters and Sportabouts were built, {{out of a total}} of 217,623 Wayfarers of all bodystyles.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{original}} pilot for Rocko's Modern Life, the animators colored Rocko yellow.

Murray fought the changes with the Nickelodeon executives; in the end the executives insisted on changing the color, so Murray changed the color to beige and disliked the choice.

2500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and observed a [...] "seductive pastiche" [...] on [...] "the kind of record {{that might not be}} deep but shimmers pleasingly on the surface". Billboards Gail Mitchell called it a [...] "spirited nod to the '70s soul/funk that has influenced [...] career". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that Benét's voice is [...] "more flexible than ever" [...] and called him [...] "an able and sometimes ardent mimic to boot, not just of Maxwell’s tender histrionics but of several other styles". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel writer Jon M. Gilbertson complimented Benét's musical influences and smooth soul style. USA Todays Steve Jones gave the album three out of four stars and praised his [...] "sensual and sophisticated balladry" [...] on the album. Mikael Wood of The Village Voice called it a [...] "crafty album" [...] and wrote that Benét [...] "expertly channels <b>the</b> <b>plush</b> balladry of mid-’80s Luther Vandross ('Never Live Without You'), the propulsive zing of early-’70s Philly soul ('Paid,' featuring Eddie Levert himself), and the frantic cheer of last-days disco ('Good Life')".|$|E

Whilst this may seem an exaggerated claim by its makers, the 1800/Kimberley platform did provide excellent passenger room for a vehicle of such a compact outer dimensions, a legacy of Sir Alec Issigonis who strived for increased cabin space on a small footprint as witness the Mini, 1100, 1800 and Maxi.|$|R
