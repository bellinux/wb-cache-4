500|$|Danny Elfman {{was worried}} the {{characterization}} of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character {{was inspired by the}} Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. [...] "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," [...] Selick continued. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it".|$|E
500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} was {{deliberate}} that we were {{made to look like}} we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. [...] They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context. [...] We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers and young women. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> really important concepts that the media never addressed.|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{an uncanny}} feeling, Charlie. I felt it myself, {{and was very}} {{grateful}} that we were hidden from the enemy, who, of course, were blazing away in {{the direction in which}} they had last seen us. We only lost three killed and twelve wounded, altogether, and I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>were,</b> for the most part, hit by random shots.|$|R
2500|$|Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how the character [...] "is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview was circulated, and attracted the attention of director J.J. Abrams. Quinto was subsequently the first actor to be cast in the film, while Nimoy was confirmed to return as the older [...] "Prime" [...] version of Spock from the main timeline.|$|E
2500|$|According to Lopez, she {{initially}} didn't want [...] "Jenny {{from the}} Block" [...] or [...] "All I Have" [...] {{to be released}} as singles from the album. She felt that the tracks were too similar to her previous singles such as [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] and [...] "I'm Real"; {{she felt like she}} was [...] "visiting old territory". [...] "Those tracks were like a different era for me, and I didn't want people to perceive it like I'm just trying to capitalize on the same thing. But the record company was like, 'Who cares what they <b>think,</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> hits mama!'". Lopez, who stated she [...] "calls the shots", eventually agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} {{delightful}} of books," [...] said Miss March. [...] "I {{have been looking}} over the volumes on your shelves, Mrs Keswick. I am sure there are {{a good many of}} them Mr Croft would like to read, even if he has read them before. There are lots of queer old-time histories and biographies, and sets of bound magazines, some of them over a hundred years old. Would you like me to select some for you, Mr Croft? Or shall I write some of the titles on a slip of paper, and let you select for yourself?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{should not}} have given the publick or myself the trouble of this vindication, if my name had not been made use of by several persons, to whom I never lent it; one of which, a few days ago, was pleased to father on me a new sett of predictions. But I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> things too serious to be trifled with. It grieved me to the heart, when I saw my labours, which had cost me so much thought and watching, bawl'd about by common hawkers, which I only {{intended}} for the weighty consideration of the gravest persons. This prejudiced the world so much at first, that several of my friends had the assurance to ask me whether I were in jest? To which I only answered coldly, that the event would shew. But it is the talent of our age and nation, to turn things of the greatest importance into ridicule. When {{the end of the}} year had verified all my predictions, out comes Mr. Partridge's almanack, disputing the point of his death; so that I am employed, like the general who was forced to kill his enemies twice over, whom a necromancer had raised to life. If Mr. Partridge has practised the same experiment upon himself, and be again alive, long may he continue so; that does not in the least contradict my veracity: But I think I have clearly proved, by invincible demonstration, that he died at farthest within half an hour of the time I foretold, and not four hours sooner, as the above-mentioned author, in his letter to a lord, hath maliciously suggested, with design to blast my credit, by charging me with so gross a mistake.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot see how I {{shall be}} glad to live. The maggior dolore and the miseria have lasted longer than the tempo felice." [...] She paused {{and then went on}} dreamily,--"Dolore--miseria--I <b>think</b> <b>those</b> words <b>are</b> alive." ...|$|R

5000|$|A vote on April 14 {{resulted}} in the measure failing to achieve the required three-fourths majority, passing 95-0 in the House but failing 25-10 in the Senate with Hester and nine other Republicans opposing the measure. Hester has said the $2.6 billion of state revenues allocated to AHTD is [...] "adequate". Hester offered cuts to the public television Arkansas Educational Television Network (AETN), War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, and business incentives to fund some state programs, to which Hutchinson has said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> realistic proposals". Hester said a competing proposal will be forthcoming from the Arkansas Works opponents.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say that I do {{not believe}} them," [...] {{answered}} the captain sternly. [...] "It is an exceedingly wicked thing to steal and to tell lies. White men <b>think</b> <b>those</b> who <b>are</b> guilty of such conduct to be very bad." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a December 2011 interview, Canada's {{new foreign}} affairs {{minister}} John Baird attributed {{the failure to}} win a seat to principled positions taken by Canada on certain international issues: “Maybe if we had shut up, and not talked about gay rights in Africa; maybe if we had shut up and been more quiet about our concerns about Sri Lanka; maybe if we hadn't been so vocally against the deplorable human rights record in Iran, maybe Iran might have voted for us.... But we didn't and I don't think we regret anything. Iran probably voted against us; North Korea probably voted against us; Gadhafi probably voted against us.

Ziva certainly has to deal with the loss and the tumultuous familial background that she has...Even with the complexity of what existed between Ziva and Eli, {{at the end of the}} day, he was her father and she loved him.
