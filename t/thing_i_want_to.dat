So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time.

[...] "Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type of <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do more of." [...] Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video Home Delivery Call Girl, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled La Vie En Nose, includes one of Nozomi's videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.|$|E
2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for Day for Night.

Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I {{got back in the}} day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem of how to get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem before I can solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do.' But now what I want to do is kick people out of the way." [...] Corgan later revealed that the follow up to Monuments to an Elegy would no longer to be titled Day for Night.|$|E
