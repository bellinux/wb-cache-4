5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|Many {{songs on}} Graduation contain {{background}} vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring {{the country with}} U2 around November 2006. Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who asked if she could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed her views.|$|E

25|$|Pathé gave Morse the {{opportunity}} to indulge in a level of experimentation, not only by recording her own songs, but also through {{the opportunity}} to explore the limits of her vocal abilities.

500|$|Having {{previously}} {{been drawn to}} other musical women, Shelley greatly appreciated her talents. Jane could skilfully play the flute, harp, and guitar. Shelley was particularly captivated by Jane's singing voice, {{to the extent that}} some commentators have suggested it had a hypnotic effect on him. Shelley once purchased a guitar for Jane, and commemorated the gift in the poem [...] "With a Guitar, to Jane". In this poem, he ascribes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> the ability to alter the consciousnesses of her audience. Jane kept the guitar for her entire life and played it often. Shelley also purchased her a flageolet and wanted to give her a harp, but abandoned that plan due to its expense.|$|E

[...] Slate magazine's Aisha Harris felt that Gaga and Kelly's efforts worked [...] "surprisingly well". Nidhi Tewari of International Business Times said that Gaga sounded her [...] "rebellious best" [...] on the upbeat song. Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song {{four out of five}} stars, stating that its [...] "ear-snagging melody revives some of her earlier pop perfection." [...] Hilary Hughes from Esquire felt that Kelly's guest appearance on the song, improved its quality much more than the preceding single [...] "Applause". Hughes added that Gaga's Whitney Houston-esque vocals are elevated further by Kelly's [...] "standard, soaring tenor". [...] "Do What U Want" [...] was listed as one of the 100 Best Songs Of 2013 by Rolling Stone, ranked at number 17.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Ranaut portrayed {{an aspiring}} musician in Suneel Darshan's musical thriller Shakalaka Boom Boom, alongside Bobby Deol, Upen Patel and Celina Jaitly. The film's production {{was marred by}} a dispute between Ranaut and Darshan; she objected <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> being dubbed by another artist, but he insisted that he needed a particular [...] "twang and accent" [...] for her character. India Today described the film as an [...] "amateur mess" [...] and the film {{proved to be a}} box office flop. She next reunited with Anurag Basu for the ensemble drama Life in a... Metro, playing the supporting role of Neha, a shrewd socialite engaged in an affair with her married boss (played by Kay Kay Menon). Despite a poor initial run at the box office, the film emerged as a profitable venture. Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times was critical of the film, noting its lack of originality and realism. In a more positive review, Raja Sen wrote that Ranaut [...] "is refreshing [...] and manages to herd her emotions well, playing a complex role but hardly ever overreaching", but criticised her delivery of English lines. For her role, Ranaut was awarded the Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance – Female.|$|E
500|$|Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said Cyrus' {{attempt to}} leave Hannah Montana was weak, only {{being driven by}} [...] "more gray thoughts". Ratliff continued, [...] "She eases up on songs with total-affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than Moms and Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again". Cinquemani finished, [...] "For teen-pop, your kid could do worse. You know, like Avril [...] ". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "If her lyrical prowess hasn't caught up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> yet, that should only hold promise of things to come. She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus, in Breakout, as the ideal of the American Dream: [...] "a combination of hard work, good Christian living and un-smutty pop".|$|E

500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost {{at the bottom of}} her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{character}} has garnered positive reviews as well. Sara Franks-Allen of ScreenCrush wrote that [...] "If being a Disney princess is {{about being a}} good role model for little girls, then Nala has a lot in her favor", elaborating, [...] "She's strong enough to take down Simba, ventures out on her own to find help for her pride and calls Simba out for ignoring his responsibilities." [...] Meanwhile, Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog ranked Nala 14th on her list of [...] "The 16 Most Awesome Female Characters From Disney Movies". Responsible for introducing the seasoned actress to a younger audience, Kelly's vocal performance as Nala has garnered critical acclaim. Writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe hailed Kelly's voice acting as [...] "terrific." [...] Jeremy Gerard of Variety commended Kelly for voicing {{the character}} [...] "beautifully". PopSugar ranked Kelly among the website's [...] "Favorite Animated Voices", writing, [...] "there are a lot of great voices in Disney's The Lion King ... but Moira Kelly has a unique quality <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and I remember reveling in it as a youngster anytime the adult Nala was on the screen." [...] Official Disney Blogs published an article entitled [...] "We All Thought it… But Nala Actually Said It", which cites the character's most revered quotes. The blog also ranked Nala eighth on the website's [...] "Definitive Ranking of Disney Cats" [...] list. In a 2014 interview, actor Eddie Redmayne admitted that Nala was his first [...] "celebrity crush", having been specifically attracted to the character's [...] "sweet" [...] face and singing voice, referring to the experience as his [...] "sexual awakening".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, {{but it was so}} nice to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise to keep in touch and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E

500|$|The {{background}} {{score was}} composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet. The main {{theme of the}} songs is the Romani association with France. Despite the sad story, there are cheerful tracks too, with pieces for the waltz, tarantella and java. The film's music plays a prominent role from the opening credits to Catherine Ringer's track in the closing credits, [...] "Les Bohemians", a waltz piece written by Gatlif and Mantoulet, which is described as setting {{the tone for the}} film. [...] "Les Bohemians" [...] is the first French song ever featured in a Gatlif movie. Gatlif chose Ringer for the track, inspired by the [...] "blood in the mouth" [...] feel <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> The song translates as [...] "Good luck to you all, if anyone worries that we’re gone, tell them we’ve been thrown from the light and the sky, we the lords of this vast universe." [...] The java dance piece composed by Delphine accompanies a scene where the characters secretly congregate in a barn for dancing, signifying the scenario then when public gatherings were prohibited. The track [...] "Un Poulailler A La Bastilles", sung by Gatlif's son Valentin Dahmani, plays on the existing racist stereotype of Romani as chicken thieves. The film also incorporates sound effects of horses, explosions and a watch mechanism. The soundtrack also has a tune of the [...] "Le Temps des cerises", the revolutionary song of the Paris Commune. The music for the song's version in the movie was composed by Gatlif, using clockwork sounds and banjo. Other soundtrack vocalists included Kalman Urszuj, Sandu Ciorba and Ikola.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
