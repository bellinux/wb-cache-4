5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are <b>the</b> <b>disturbing</b> element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} {{with many of}} Murakami's novels, 1Q84 is dominated by religious and sacred concepts. 1Q84s plot is built around a mystical cult and two long-lost lovers who are drawn into a distorted version of reality. 1Q84 serves as a culmination {{of many of his}} prior works, assigning further meaning to his previous novels. 1Q84 draws a connection between the supernatural and <b>the</b> <b>disturbing.</b> Readers are often cited as experiencing a religious unease that is similar to postmodern sensibilities. This unease is accomplished through Murakami's creation of characters whose religious prescriptions are presented as oppressive, as exemplified in the character of Leader, who is the founder of the Sakigake cult.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, Tony's wife Hannah arrives on his doorstep, with <b>the</b> <b>disturbing</b> news that her new lover, Neville Agard (Gordon Case), had been beating both her and their {{daughter}} Cassie. Tony is furious and promptly confronts Neville, returning later covered in blood. Despite their past problems, Tony and Hannah decide to give their marriage another chance and both she and Cassie come to live in Albert Square. Problems still persist, however, and Hannah regularly nags Tony and makes it clear to him that Walford {{is not good enough}} for her. Things reach a climax when Tony hits Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer) in February 1987 for making a pass at Hannah. Hannah is furious and can't condone his violent actions, despite willingly allowing him to assault her ex-lover months earlier. Hannah subsequently decides that the marriage is over and she leaves Walford to live with her sister.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite <b>the</b> <b>disturbing</b> undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.|$|E

25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for <b>the</b> <b>disturbing</b> forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E
25|$|Although Poets Follies earned Kees much notoriety, {{his other}} {{projects}} {{did not find}} {{the same kind of}} support. A film company ended in a lawsuit. His collaborations with Helm, Ketty Lester, and other musicians, although professionally satisfying, did not produce any hit records. A permanent home for the Poets Follies, the Showplace, a large building on Fulton Street in the Mission District, was closed in late May 1955, just days before the premiere of a serious one-act play, The Waiting Room, which Kees had written for three actress friends. During much of July, Kees spent time with a woman he had met while working at Langley Porter, a Jungian psychiatrist named Virginia Patterson. Like other relationships Kees had following his divorce, this ended abruptly. Kees, too, had been taking barbiturates for the past two years, which also had intensified his episodes of manic depression. After visiting his parents in Santa Barbara, California, one last time in early July, as well as his friend, the literary critic Hugh Kenner, Kees returned to San Francisco and had dinner with various friends, including Pauline Kael, who appeared as a guest on Kees’s film review program on KPFA-FM, Behind the Movie Camera. She noticed <b>the</b> <b>disturbing</b> changes in Kees’s demeanor. For several days in mid-July, Kees drank and commiserated with his friend and business partner, the San Francisco newspaperman and novelist Michael Grieg. He even confessed to have tried jumping over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge, but he could not physically manage it. He talked of going to Mexico as an alternative, a country that fascinated him up until then in books such as Malcolm Lowry’s Under the Volcano. Then Kees returned to his home in the Marina District on the evening of July 17, 1955. What he did the following day is a mystery. He took a call from Michael Grieg, who told Kees of a possible job offer. Kees also telephoned a friend, the memoirist Janet Richards, seeking her company.|$|E

40|$|Excavation {{in a rock}} mass {{leads to}} the {{perturbation}} of the stress regime, often creating a stress-relieved, locally weakened zone known as <b>the</b> <b>disturbed</b> zone.

The vertical extent of <b>the</b> <b>disturbed</b> zone was determined jointly by cross-hole seismic wave penetration testing and borehole elastic modulus testing, and the horizontal extent was assessed by monitoring and evaluating the deformation characteristics. Compared with the undisturbed rock mass, the P-wave velocity of <b>the</b> <b>disturbed</b> zone was reduced by 34 - 38 % and the borehole elastic modulus by 12 - 31 %.
