5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E
5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E

The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing {{to make up for}} their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{played his}} {{first game of the}} season on February 15 against the Dallas Stars. The game was also witness <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Canucks history as Henrik Sedin {{recorded}} two assists to pass Markus Naslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer, with 757 points. After recording the record setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes the play stopped, and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Naslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. As for Kesler, he registered an assist and blocked three shots in over 17 minutes of ice time of the 4–3 loss. After experiencing some discomfort in his right foot, Kesler had X-rays taken. The X-rays were negative and he continued to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the concept}} of a Riemannian {{manifold}} permits an expression of the Euclidean structure in any smooth coordinate system, via metric tensor. From this tensor one can compute the Riemann curvature tensor. Where the latter equals to zero, the metric structure is locally Euclidean (it means that at least some open set in the coordinate space is isometric <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> Euclidean space), no matter whether coordinates are affine or curvilinear.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} where Scipionyx was found, in the Albian {{was part of}} the Apulian Plate, at the time largely covered by the shallow Paratethys. Some dry land was present however, but it is uncertain how extensive or connected the several terranes were. The marine sediments of the Pietraroja Plattenkalk were probably deposited closely <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the Apennine Platform, which piece possibly formed a small island between the present middle of Italy and Tunisia. From this it has been concluded that the habitat of Scipionyx in general consisted of small islands and it represented one of the larger animals of its ecosystem.|$|E

But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others to let a musical motif endure a fate.

25|$|Bahia Bakari (born 15 August 1996) is a French {{woman who}} was the sole {{survivor}} of Yemenia Flight 626, an Airbus A310, which crashed into the Indian Ocean near the north coast of Grande Comore, Comoros on 30 June 2009, killing the 152 other people on board. Bakari, who could barely swim and had no life vest, clung <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> aircraft wreckage, floating in heavy seas for over nine hours, {{much of it in}} pitch darkness, before being rescued. Her mother, who had been traveling with her from Paris, France, for a summer vacation in Comoros, died in the crash.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us with {{the meaning of a}} word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the battle, as dawn was about to break, the allied fleet had the upper hand and half of Shimazu's fleet were either sunk or captured. It was said that Yoshihiro's {{flagship}} was sunk and that he was clinging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood in the icy water. Japanese ships came to his rescue, pulling him to safety. During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water.

25|$|Given {{the close}} {{affinity}} of Zhenyuanlong with Microraptor, Changyuraptor and Sinornithosaurus, {{it is noteworthy}} that the specimen does not preserve any feathers on the hind limbs. Some of its closest relatives are known for long, voluminous vaned feathers attaching to the ankles and lower legs, and Zhenyuanlongs lack of similar feathers may indicate another unique anatomical feature of this animal among its relatives. However, the specimen's hind limbs belong <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> slab that preserves no other feathers on the body, while the other pieces all preserve feathers. Therefore, the lack of leg-feathers on Zhenyuanlong may be an artifact of preservation or preparation and, like the presence of a tail fan, cannot be ruled out with certainty.|$|E
