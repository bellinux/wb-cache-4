5|$|After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, {{the most}} {{prominent}} events for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the modern Olympic Games {{at the end of}} the 19th century marked a new high for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field.</b> The Olympic athletics programme, comprising <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and only amateur sportsmen could compete. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had played baseball professionally.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{governance of}} <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> {{falls under the}} jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the global governing body for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and athletics as a whole. The governance of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.|$|E

He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory. The competition featured variations on traditional <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events. He committed himself to three further editions.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> became {{increasingly}} more professional and international, as the IAAF gained {{over two hundred}} member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> meetings.|$|E
5|$|Hayward Field {{has been}} host to {{numerous}} national <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> {{events such as}} the U.S. Olympic Trials, NCAA Championships, and the USA <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championships. No other venue has hosted more NCAA Championships and no other venue had held three consecutive U.S. Olympic Trials. Many have attested to the magical aura of Hayward field, citing many personal bests run at the venue. Credit often goes to the regular attendance of knowledgeable <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> fans for the phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Mirroring {{the role}} that <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events held within them. Typically, <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.|$|E
5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E

5|$|The Oregon Ducks <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> {{program is}} the intercollegiate <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> team for the University of Oregon located in the U.S. state of Oregon. The team competes at the NCAA Division I level {{and is a member}} of the Pac-12 Conference. The team participates in indoor and outdoor <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> as well as cross country. Known as the Ducks, Oregon's first <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> team was fielded in 1895. The team holds its home meets at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. Robert Johnson is the current head coach and since the program's {{inception}} in 1895, there have only been seven permanent head coaches. The Ducks claim 31 NCAA National Championships among the three disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The major global <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> {{competitions}} {{are both}} held under {{the scope of}} athletics. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> contests make {{up the majority of}} events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this {{worked on a}} quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every two years since 1985 {{and this is the}} only world championships that consists of solely <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events.|$|E

5|$|The {{university}} has an intercollegiate sports program that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The NCAA's Division I sports at the University of Houston include baseball, basketball, cross country, American football, golf, and <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> for men; basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, and <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> for women.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} indoor {{continental}} competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There {{has not been}} a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championships. Most countries have a national championship in <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships.

5|$|Up {{until the}} early 1920s, <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> had been almost {{exclusively}} a male-only pursuit. A growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America led {{to the establishment of}} the Women's World Games in 1921 and this ultimately caused the introduction of five <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. In 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field.</b> The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only {{towards the end of the}} century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>field</b> competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|At Beijing, four athletes {{competed for}} the Cook Islands. Of those competitors, three were men (Heather, Okotai, Pera) {{and one was}} a woman (Tapoki).
