2500|$|In 1976, Guzzi {{released}} the 850 Le Mans, a cafe racer {{that was a}} stylistic masterpiece and still today {{considered one of the}} most iconic and sought-after of all Guzzis. A marketing success that would compete with other Italian superbikes, it spawned four later models from Mark II to its culmination in the 1990s, the Mark V. The initial model is known widely but incorrectly as the Mark I. Technically, it is simply the 850 Le Mans. It was named in homage to the 24-hour endurance race and circuit in France. The Mark I had two production runs with slight modifications. The first run, known as Series 1, used the roundish CEV stop/taillight used on many Italian bikes of the decade. Fewer than 2,000 of the round taillight bikes were made and they are the most desirable Guzzi of the era. The second production run, known as the Series 2 and totaling around 4,000 bikes, used a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight/reflector and modified rear guard. This was also used on the Mark II and SP models. The taillight and guard was the biggest change between Series 1 and 2 but other modifications included later inclusion of a <b>tripmeter,</b> black fork lowers, a more generous dual seat that replaced the split-prone original seat, exhaust pipe heel guards and inferior fuel taps. The extra cost compared to the [...] "cooking" [...] T3 model paid for performance items such as high-compression domed pistons, larger inlet and exhaust valves and Dell'Orto 36mm pumper carbs with filterless grey plastic velocity stacks. Most Mk I bikes were brilliant red although a very small number were painted in metallic ice blue. An exceedingly small number of Series 2 bikes were white.|$|E

5000|$|Honda XL185 is a dual-sport {{motorcycle}} {{produced by}} Honda. It is {{an updated version}} of Honda XL175. It has a 180 cc, four-stroke, SOHC engine. Instrument gauge contains speedometer, odometer, and resettable <b>tripmeter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The optical systems being {{considered}} for automotive virtual image displays may confront drivers with slgnificantly more vertical disparity than their military connter-parts. Military head-up displays, for example, are limited to 1 milliradian (mrad) of vertical disparity whereas automotive displays may have 5 mrad. Three experiments were performed to examine performance with virtual image displays {{as a function of}} amount of vertical disparity. Stimuli were simple speed-ometer dials with embedded <b>tripmeters</b> representing both analog and digital display tasks. Stimuli were presented tachistoscopically and subjects were required to read one or both instruments on each trial. Disparity did not affect performance accuracy. Large disparities did, however, result in diplopia and, possibly, suppression of one of the visual images. Nevertheless, it appears that, at least in the driving situation, where displays are used intermittent-ly and briefly for the information contained in them, comparatively large amounts of vertical disparity in displays will not degrade performance and may not even be noticed...|$|R
50|$|Instrumentation {{consists}} of an analog speedometer and tachometer and basic indicator lamps, incorporated under a tinted window, and a single <b>tripmeter.</b> While it normally was equipped with a centerstand, California models did not have room for one due to additional emissions control equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian-market 240 km/h-160 mph {{speedometer}} (with km/h predominant) is {{fitted to}} the European models. Odometer and <b>tripmeter</b> are in kilometres. As the 2001-2006 Sebring sedan and convertible {{were made in}} left-hand drive only, they were not sold in the UK and Ireland. Chrysler UK did however, import 50 convertibles with the 2.7L engine in 2001/2002, and these were sold though selected dealers. Being non-standard in Chrysler's UK range at the time though, no more were imported.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2004, the Avanza 1.3 S (series S) with {{automatic}} transmission launched to the market. The 1.3-litre engine was upgrade to use VVT-i (K3-VE) technology and individual direct ignition coils. Major changes in {{this version of}} Avanza occurred in the interior to change the odometer and digital <b>tripmeter</b> located beside the speedometer and tachometer. The braking system was upgraded to include anti-lock. The launch of this version is also designated as [...] "Test Market" [...] for the development plan of the All Avanza-Xenia VVT-i and Automatic Edition. This special edition comes {{with automatic}} transmission only. Only 200 units of Avanza Type S manufactured. A new exterior color (black) was added at the same time.|$|E
