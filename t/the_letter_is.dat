5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate in Finland {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm.

5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have been}} published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it.

5|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Gregory {{initiated}} the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote {{a history of the}} British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous Life of Gregory written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby Life of Gregory, records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> also open to other interpretations.|$|E
