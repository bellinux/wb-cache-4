5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E

Bormann assumed Hess' former duties, with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei (Party Chancellery), after Hess' solo flight to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government. He had final approval over civil service appointments, reviewed and approved legislation, and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters. Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II.|$|E

Second, there are many sample <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> units, which are divided into several ordered sample standards in terms of production strategy, and the constraint condition consists {{of one of the}} sample standards. Furthermore, the efficiency is illustrated by considering the efficiency relationship between <b>the</b> evaluated <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> unit and sample <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> units from constraint condition. Third, to reduce the computation complexity, we introduce an algorithm based on the binary search tree in the model to choose the sample standard that has similar behavior with <b>the</b> evaluated <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> unit.

TheWorld Model is a software component developed to fulfill the purpose of collecting information from perception and communication subsystems, maintaining an up-to-date view of the vehicle’s environment, and providing the required input information to <b>the</b> Real-Time <b>Decision</b> <b>Making</b> subsystem in a well-defined, and structured way. <b>The</b> real-time <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> process consists of two consecutive stages.

The complex task of autonomous driving is subdivided into subtasks, called driving maneuvers, which represent the output (i. e. <b>decision</b> alternatives) of <b>the</b> real-time <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> process. Driving maneuvers are considered as implementations of closed-loop control algorithms, each capable of maneuvering the autonomous vehicle in a specific traffic situation.
