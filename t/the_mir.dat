Unlike {{the vast majority of}} commercial and ideological films in the 1970s, Solaris was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks, giving it cult status. In the Eastern Bloc and in the West, Solaris premiered later.

Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E

The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It has been active in the field of space science with RADOM-7 radiation monitoring experiments on the International Space Station and Chandrayaan-1, and domestically developed space greenhouses on <b>the</b> <b>Mir</b> space station.

As a result, most of the station's occupants were Soviet; through international collaborations such as the Intercosmos, Euromir and Shuttle–Mir programmes, the station was made accessible to space travelers from several Asian, European and North American nations. Mir was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off.

Lucid became the first American to carry out a long-duration mission aboard Mir with her 188-day mission, which set the US single spaceflight record. During Lucid's time aboard Mir, Priroda, the station's final module, arrived as did French visitor Claudie Haigneré flying the Cassiopée mission.

40|$|We present new {{families}} of valid inequalities for (mixed) integer programming (MIP) problems. These valid inequalities {{are based on}} a generalization of the 2 -step mixed integer rounding (MIR), proposed by Dash and Günlük (2006). We prove that for any positive integer n, n facets of a certain (n + 1) -dimensional mixed integer set can be obtained through a process which includes n consecutive applications of MIR. We then show that for any n, the last of these facets, <b>the</b> n-step <b>MIR</b> facet, can be used to generate a family of valid inequalities for the feasible set of a general (mixed) IP constraint, <b>the</b> n-step <b>MIR</b> inequalities. <b>The</b> Gomory Mixed Integer Cut and <b>the</b> 2 -step <b>MIR</b> inequality of Dash and Günlük (2006) are simply the first two families corresponding to n = 1, 2, respectively. <b>The</b> n-step <b>MIR</b> inequalities are easily produced using closed-form periodic functions, which we refer to as <b>the</b> n-step <b>MIR</b> functions. None of these functions dominates the other on its whole period.
