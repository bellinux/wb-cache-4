The capacity <b>to</b> <b>photosensitize</b> biological substrates (lipids, proteins, DNA) has been analyzed, {{as well as their}} photocytotoxicity on red blood cells and 3 T 3 murine fibroblasts. The results obtained show that the quinolones studied are able <b>to</b> <b>photosensitize</b> red blood cell lysis in an oxygen-dependent way and induce a high decrease in cell viability after UVA irradiation.

Cellular phototoxicity was inhibited by the addition of free radical and hydroxyl radical scavengers (BHA, GSH and DMTU), suggesting the involvement of a radical mechanism in their cytotoxicity. A good correlation was observed between lipid peroxidation and phototoxicity, indicating that the test compounds exert their toxic effects mainly in the cellular membrane.

In this paper we demonstrate the photodynamic properties of three chlorins, derived from chlorophyll a, and the usefulness of liposomal carriers to design pharmaceutical formulations. The chlorins have been quantitatively incorporated into stable liposomes obtained from a mixture of l-α-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and l-α-dioleoylphosphatidylserine in a 13. 5 : 1. 5 molar ratio (POPC/OOPS-liposomes). The chlorin uptake by skin fibroblasts increases steadily, reaching in all cases a plateau level dependent on both the chlorin structure and the vehicle employed. The photophysical properties of the three chlorins in THF are nearly identical and fulfill the requirements for a PDT photosensitizer. Incorporation of chlorins into liposomes induces important changes in their photophysics, but does not impair their cellular uptake or their cell photosensitization ability. In fact we observe in the cells the same photophysical behavior as in THF solution. Specifically, we demonstrate, by recording the near-IR phosphorescence of 1 O 2, that the chlorins are able <b>to</b> <b>photosensitize</b> the production of 1 O 2 in the cell membrane. The cell-photosensitization efficiency depended on the chlorin and cell line nature, the carrier, {{and the length of}} pre-incubation and post-irradiation periods.

This photo-oxidation reaction involves singlet molecular oxygen (O- 1 (2)) {{as an intermediate}} and its presence is confirmed by quenching studies using bis(diethyldithiocarbamato) nickel(II) (Ni(DDTC) 2), a physical quencher of O- 1 (2). The ability of the mononuclear complexes <b>to</b> <b>photosensitize</b> the above photo-oxidation reaction follows the order: [Pt(DHB) (PHEN) ] > [Pt(DHB) (DPP) ] > [Pt(DHB) (BIQ) ] > [Pt(DHB) (BPY) ] > [Pd(DHB) (DPP) ] {{greater than or equal}} to [Pd(DHB) (PHEN) ] > [Pd(DHB) (BIQ) ]{{greater than or equal to}} [Pd(DHB) (BPY) ]. Moreover, the dinuclear complexes, in comparison with the analogous mononuclear complexes, follow the order: [{Pt(BPY) }(2) (THB) ]> [Pt(DHB) (BPY) ] > [{Pd(BPY) }(2) (DHB) ] > [Pd(DHB) (BPY) ]. These orders depend on the metal ion, the number of metal ions in the complex, the nature of the alpha-diimine ligand and the distortion from planar geometry of the metal comple...|$|E
40|$|The porphyrias are {{diseases}} {{that result from}} inherited or acquired abnormalities of porphyrin-heme synthesis in the liver and the bone marrow. Only the hepatic porphyrias {{are known to be}} aggravated by exposure to a variety of exogenous drugs and chemicals. Simple avoidance of these agents will reduce the risk of developing hepatic porphyria and may lead to clinical improvement in patients with active disease. Some types of therapy of the hepatic porphyrias are effective because of their ability to modulate the activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis. Most of the porphyrias are associated with cutaneous photosensitivity, the treatment of which centers about either reducing the excessive production of porphyrins or of inhibiting the photobiological response <b>to</b> these <b>photosensitizing</b> chemicals in the skin...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{alternative}} treatment for cancer that involves the administration of a photosensitizing agent, which is activated by light at a specific wavelength. The photo-toxic phase of this therapy can be described by a dynamic model composed of six nonlinear differential equations. The model parameters can be used <b>to</b> compare <b>photosensitizing</b> agents in their capability to produce cytotoxic species. The practical issue is their estimation from in vivo experimental data. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to analyze the photophysical parameters estimability through a local practical identifiability study combined with a global sensitivity analysis. Results show that only three parameters can reasonably be estimated in a given and realistic experimental framework. Input design (light signal) and model reduction are currently in progress...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHerein, {{a simple}} and novel method was used to {{synthesize}} a new structure of graphene which can be called hollow graphene. First, the ZnO-Graphene QDs synthesized by solution method and then ZnO QDs were dissolved from this structure using an acidic solution to obtain hollow structure of graphene.  Afterward, this structure was used in PbS QDs solar cell {{in order to improve}} the transport of electron and decrease the recombination of the carriers. A power conversion efficiency of 5. 3 % was obtained using hollow graphene as a fast electron extraction layer due to the enhancement of EQE and current density. The improvement of PCE in this device was corresponded <b>to</b> efficient <b>photosensitized</b> electron injection from the conduction band of PbS QDs to the LUMO levels of hollow graphene and slow carriers recombination...|$|R
