50|$|A <b>thread</b> <b>shank</b> {{is created}} by loosely {{stitching}} a shankless button onto fabric. This is usually done by keeping a toothpick or other small object in between the button and fabric while the button is stitched on. Once the button has been sewn through a few times, the toothpick is removed and the needle is moved down {{through one of the}} buttonholes, placing the needle and its thread in between the button and fabric. The sewer takes care to not tighten the thread too much. While holding the button away from the garment, the thread is then firmly wrapped around the button (in between the button and fabric) a few times to form a sturdy wrapper for the other threads. The needle is then pushed through the fabric to the underside of the garment, where it can then be securely fastened off. A <b>thread</b> <b>shank's</b> length depends on the thickness of the fabric that will be buttoned. The ideal <b>thread</b> <b>shank</b> is long enough to button the fabric and still have the garment draping nicely, but short enough that the button does not flop around when buttoned.|$|R
50|$|Flat or sew-through buttons have holes {{through which}} thread is sewn {{to attach the}} button.

The anchor bolt is consist of <b>shank</b> and <b>thread.</b> <b>Shank</b> of the bolt does yield when area ratio of <b>thread</b> to <b>shank</b> is lower than yield ratio. The thread of the bolt yields and short thread may break early under a severe earthquake. Then AIJ provision recommended that area ratio of thred to shank is larger than yield ratio and the shank yields before the thread reaches to its maximum tensile strength. However, {{it is possible to}} serve enough deformation {{capacity of}} the exposed column-base when thread length ratio set a proper value to a severe earthquake response. Heuce, we performed cyclic loading test on exposed column-base to show the possibility. We investigated the mechanical properties of the column-base by comparing the simple evaluation formula and F.

30|$|The {{characteristic}} strength properties of structural glulam connections assembled with self-tapping screws were examined following the ASTM testing procedure in the study. Four screw types with various numbers were designated at each connection of the beam–girder structure with different nailing schedules. The {{results indicated that}} the maximum load capacity and dissipated energy of a connection fastened with 10 -mm self-tapping screws were higher than those with 8 -mm screws. And, the screws with both double-threaded sections and fully <b>threaded</b> <b>shanks</b> were higher than those of single-threaded screws. An improvement on the initial stiffness of a connection was found when the number of self-tapping screws increased. The connections assembled with the toe-nailing approach from the beam’s bottom surface provided higher maximum loading capacity, medium initial stiffness, and a larger ductility factor, resulting in higher dissipated energy with less fragile failure. The derived allowable loading values for a beam–girder connection fastened with self-tapping screws using the face-nailing approach were close to the code values for bolted and pinned connections. And, a toe-nailing approach provided higher allowable loads for connections than using a face-nail approach.|$|R
30|$|The {{structural}} glulam members fabricated with rapid-grown Japanese cedar plantation timber {{were constructed}} into a beam–girder structure with self-tapping screws to evaluate characteristic strength {{properties of the}} connection {{for the purpose of}} wood-framed construction application. It is suggested that self-tapping screws with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. Self-tapping screws with fully <b>threaded</b> <b>shanks</b> showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using screws with half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using self-tapping screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A self-tapping screw connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|R

A traveling ball nut threaded on the power screw is formed with an external annular arcuate surface configured {{in the form of}} a spherical segment and enclosed by a ball nut housing with a conforming arcuate surface for permitting gimballed motion thereon. The ball nut housing is provided with a mounting surface which is positionable in cooperable engagement with the mounting interface of a primary structure to be coupled to the supporting structure. Cooperative means are provided on the ball nut and ball nut housing, respectively, for positioning the ball nut and ball nut housing in relative gimballed position within a predetermined range of relative angular relationship whereby severe structural stresses due to unequal loadings and undesirable bending moments on the mechanism are avoided...|$|R
40|$|Maximum {{orthodontic}} anchorage {{is useful}} in numerous clinical situations. Although traditional osteointegrated implants provide good anchorage (Ödman et al., 1988; Roberts et al., 1989; Wehrbein and Merz, 1998), they are too bulky for some applications, and therefore, miniscrews [microscrews or temporary anchorage devices (TADs) ] are often preferred (Kanomi, 1997; Ohmae et al., 2001; Miyawaki et al., 2003). Besides their smaller sizes, other advantages of the miniscrews are smooth surface, lower costs, reduced chair-side times, {{and the possibility of}} immediate loading (Fritz et al., 2004). Unlike dental implants, which acquire their stability via osteointegration, miniscrews obtain maximum stability mechanically via primary retention (Melsen and Verna 1999; Brettin et al., 2008). Numerous types of these devices, which generally consist of a single part made from an alloy of titanium and vanadium or aluminium (grade IV titanium) with similar characteristics, are currently on the market (Crismani et al., 2010). From a clinical perspective, these devices consist of two relevant portions: the head, for which various designs are available (bracket like, rounded with slot, etc.), and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shank,</b> which is generally cylindrical, tapered, or a Temporary a nchorage d evice s tability: a n e valuation of t hread s hape f acto...|$|R

A comparison of the influence on the pre-tension force between threaded holes made with a worn, versus new, threading tool is also involved in the experiment. The study is limited to handling the screw sizes M 2, 5 and M 3, 5. The results show that a regression model, with good approximation, can be fitted to the measured values. This means that, when constructing a new metal cutting tool, you can use this model to predict the resulting pre-tension force more accurately than before.

2500|$|Installer bits, {{also known}} as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be <b>threaded</b> through the <b>shank</b> end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|R
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from <b>thread</b> to unthreaded <b>shank.</b> Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of hydrogen embrittlement failure of subsea bolts operating under CP are surface cracks at <b>thread</b> and <b>shank</b> area {{and for some}} cases they are completely ruptured from the shank area. The metallurgical reason for failure already reported by researchers (including for Inconel 718) was the interaction of hydrogen atoms with grain boundary precipitates (Ni 3 Nb δ) resulting in hydrogen assisted intergranular cracking. Inconel 718 was received as rectangular block (RB) and bolts (Φ 28 mm). They were heat treated as per API 6 A 718 specifications. The yield strength and vickers hardness found for API aged RB specimen S 2 API was 840 MPa and 340 HV respectively. On the other hand API bolt was found with bulk yield strength of 880 MPa and vickers hardness in the range 370 - 400 HV (bulk to edge of the bolt). The structure of bolt (bulk, <b>shank</b> and <b>thread)</b> and rectangular block was investigated, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to understand {{the reason for this}} difference. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions. The microstructure of the API bolt shows no evidence of intergranular (Ni 3 Nb δ) precipitates and the nano-structure revealed γ’ and Ni 3 Nb γ’’ precipitates. This suggest that for Inconel 718 in the form of bolts the theory of intergranular cracking hydrogen enhanced de-cohesion at the grain boundary matrix precipitate interfaces is not specifically relevant instead the transgranular oversized γ’ precipitates (50 nm γ’ at thread edge of the bolt) and the elongated metastable γ’’ discs (50 - 100 nm at <b>shank</b> and <b>thread</b> edge of the bolt) could act as initiation point for HEDE. Moreover, it was also found that threading of the bolt (after heat treatment) results in shearing of γ’ precipitates at threads edge. These sheared γ’ precipitates could aid in trapping hydrogen atoms under CP in service leading to HEDE. The newly developed bolting materials Incoloy 945 and its higher strength version 945 x (as rectangular and cylindrical blocks) were added for structural investigation because of lower content of Nb present in their matrix than 718. Finally, as future work, the structure of 718, 945 and 945 x alloys were selected for assessing susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement using slow strain rate testing under CP...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose for}} this garment {{was to create}} an evening dress, {{inspired}} by Italian cityscapes at night, that could be worn in the evening while on a trip touring Italy. I designed it {{with the intentions of}} creating a classy and feminine romantic piece that shows both the colors, textures and nostalgia of the blinking lights of a coastal Italian city against the night sky. Process: I began by sketching renderings of ideas for the piece. During this process, I did image research on Italy and gathered images from multiple Italy destinations. From these, I established the looks and colors that I wanted to use. After a trip to Fabric Depot in Oregon to get fabric and many draping, patterning and fitting sessions later, I stitched each piece together to fit my model. Technique: I used the draping method to create Moonlight. Bed sheets were my primary material for draping the garment on a mannequin. After getting the draped piece to look the way I desired it, I moved to creating the paper pattern. I used bedsheets again to sew a sample of the garment to establish correct fit on my model and solidify the look of the design. When the sample fit correctly, I started on the fashion fabric. Carefully, I stitched the pieces together being conscious of every detail. When the base of the garment was completed, I added the final embellishments including trims and buttons. Materials: 100 -percent polyester satin, silver chain, imitation pearls, polyester lining fabric, 100 -percent cotton <b>thread,</b> invisible zipper, <b>shank</b> buttons...|$|R
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} a helicopter, which met with a Cat-I accident on November 27, 2008, were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that all the four bolts connecting the tail drive shaft (TDS) with the main gearbox (MGB) have sheared off. Fractographic study confirmed that these bolts have failed by fatigue. Examination also discovered {{that three of the}} four bolts used were not as per the design specification. It was found that these bolts were longer than that of the recommended one, and they are actually meant for use with the intermediate gearbox (IGB) casing. There was mix-up of bolts and the wrong ones were used in this particular case. The shank length of the IGB bolts is such that it does not provide enough threads to allow tightening of the assembly joint at the TDS connecting flange. Since the bolts cannot travel beyond the first <b>thread</b> from the <b>shank,</b> the reading on the torque wrench during this assembly would have been a wrong indication of tightness of the joint. In fact, the joint was either loose or did not have required pretension. Because of this, there was slip between the TDS connecting flange and the main rotor brake disc. This had resulted in excessive load on the fourth bolt which appears to have failed first by fatigue. Following this, the unequal load distribution in conjunction with the looseness in the joint was responsible for the fatigue failure of the remaining three bolts. Hence, the primary failure in the system was the failure of the bolts at the TDS connecting flange – main rotor brake disc assembly. The other damages seen on other components/structures of the helicopter are secondary in nature and would have occurred subsequent to the primary failure or during crash onto the ground. It is, therefore, stated that the mix-up of the bolts during assembly of the TDS was responsible for the failure and the accident...|$|R
6000|$|By {{watching}} the loch {{when it is}} frozen, a man might come to learn something of the springs; but, even so, {{it is hard to}} keep clear of them in summer. Now the wind almost always blows from the west, dead against the little piece of gravelly shore at the eastern side, so that casting against it is hard work and unprofitable. On this day, by a rare chance, the wind blew from the east, though the sky at first was a brilliant blue, and the sun hot and fierce. I walked round to the east side, waded in, and caught two or three small fellows. It was slow work, when suddenly there began the greatest rise of trout I ever saw in my life. From the edge of the loch as far as one could clearly see across it there was that endless plashing murmur, of all sounds in this world the sweetest to the ear. Within the view of the eye, on each cast, there were a dozen trout rising all about, never leaping, but seriously and solemnly feeding. Now is my chance at last, I fancied; but it was not so--far from it. I might throw over the very noses of the beasts, but they seldom even glanced at the (artificial) fly. I tried them with Greenwell's Glory, with a March brown, with [...] "the woodcock wing and hare- lug," [...] but it was almost to no purpose. If one did raise a fish, he meant not business--all but [...] "a casual brute," [...] which broke the already weakened part of a small [...] "glued-up" [...] cane rod. I had to twist a piece of paper round the broken end, wet it, and push it into the joint, where it hung on somehow, but was not pleasant to cast with. From twelve to half-past one the gorging went merrily forward, and I saw what the fish were rising at. The whole surface of the loch, at least on the east side, was absolutely peppered with large, hideous insects. They had big grey-white wings, bodies black as night, and brilliant crimson legs, or feelers, or whatever naturalists call them. The trout seemed as if they could not have too much of these abominable wretches, and the flies were blown across the loch, not singly, but in populous groups. I {{had never seen anything like}} them in any hook-book, nor could I deceive the trout by the primitive dodge of tying a red <b>thread</b> round the <b>shank</b> of a dark fly. So I waded out, and fell to munching a frugal sandwich and watching Nature, not without a cigarette.|$|R
