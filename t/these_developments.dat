5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. <b>These</b> <b>developments</b> compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to <b>these</b> <b>developments,</b> concerned citizens {{worried about the}} future of the habitat formed Save the Pine Bush in 1978. The organization filed lawsuits for the next several decades to stop further developments in the barrens.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Korea saw {{substantial}} industrial development, {{much of it}} {{centered in}} the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part. The POSCO steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973, and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan emerged in the same year. <b>These</b> <b>developments</b> helped to support the emergence of Gyeongju's manufacturing sector.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>developments</b> led to {{the white}} {{community}} also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a coup d'état if a black majority government took power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Européens ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. <b>These</b> <b>developments</b> contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to <b>these</b> <b>developments</b> as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E

Gillard responded to <b>these</b> <b>developments</b> by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>these</b> <b>developments,</b> a {{dedicated}} community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding the creation of custom firmware ("ROMs") built from the Android source code.

5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} <b>these</b> <b>developments</b> by linking {{them with the}} 1898 {{arguments}} Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. <b>These</b> <b>developments</b> took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>these</b> <b>developments,</b> the King immediately orders the conspirators arrested and mobilizes the army at the Bordurian border, which discourages the pending invasion.

Later, Tintin discovers that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother, when the police arrest Müsstler and rescue Professor Alembick. Ultimately, he and the Thompsons return home by flying boat.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} for the {{following}} eight years, but by 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other. The laconic account of <b>these</b> <b>developments</b> in the Primary Chronicle makes {{the course of events}} far from transparent. Vasilko and Vladimir Rostislavich, two Galcia-based princes unhappy with territorial settlement under Vsevolod, were said to have attempted to expel Yaropolk in 1084, but Grand Prince Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh drove these Rostislavchi away.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to <b>these</b> <b>developments</b> in psychology, a {{philosophical}} behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
