5|$|Plots {{are often}} {{set in motion}} by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which {{frequently}} happen in the town. The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to vociferation. The boys are also frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E
5|$|The Chumscrubber is a 2005 American-German comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Arie Posin, starring an ensemble cast led by Jamie Bell. The plot, written by Posin and Zac Stanford, {{focuses on the}} {{chain of events that}} follow the suicide of a teenage drug dealer in an idealistic but superficial town. Some of the themes addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> the inauthenticity of suburbia. The titular Chumscrubber is a character in a fictional video game that represents the town and its inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Anna Mae had {{an older}} sister, Ruby Aillene. As young children, Anna Mae and Aillene were {{separated}} when their parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, {{to work at}} a defense facility during World War II. Anna went to stay with her strict, religious paternal grandparents, Alex and Roxanna Bullock, who were deacon and deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church, which was located on Woodlawn Road off Highway 19. After the war, the sisters reunited with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> moved with them to Knoxville. Two years later, the family returned to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove community, where Anna attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade. In 1889, her great-great uncle had sold the land on which the school was built to the school trustees.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{with large}} {{communities}} of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, {{where the majority}} speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 million), the United Kingdom (60 million), Canada (19 million), Australia (at least 17 million), South Africa (4.8 million), Ireland (4.2 million), and New Zealand (3.7 million). In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces. The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to {{other countries in the}} world.|$|E

5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E

A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Marie's eldest daughter, Princess Elisabeth, {{was engaged}} to Prince George of Greece, the eldest son of the deposed King Constantine I of Greece and Marie's cousin Sophia. After {{inviting}} George and his two sisters, the Princesses Helen and Irene, to lodge with them at Sinaia, Marie organised numerous activities for the young couple and was delighted {{at the prospect of}} marrying off her daughter, whose character was severely flawed. In October, reports of King Alexander's death came from Greece; the Greek princesses needed to be returned to their parents as soon as possible. The following day, news arrived that Marie's mother had died in her sleep in Zurich. Marie made arrangements for her departure to Switzerland, where she would take Helen and Irene to <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> arrange her mother's funeral. Meanwhile, George and Elisabeth would remain at Sinaia.|$|E
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E

The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer {{to pay for the}} trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman {{threatened}} to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at 4years {{of age in}} the wild and at 3years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present {{in the vicinity of the}} nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> travel with them until the next breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.|$|E
