25|$|Most wikis {{offer at}} least a <b>title</b> <b>search,</b> and {{sometimes}} a full-text search. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as PmWiki, use flat files. MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by Lee Daniel Crocker in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external search engines such as Google Search can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions {{in order to obtain}} more precise results.|$|E
25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of <b>title</b> <b>search</b> and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E

2500|$|The {{property}} {{lingered on}} the market until the Washington Club, a private women's club, bought the Patterson Mansion on January 11, 1951. The purchase price was not immediately disclosed, but later was discovered to be just $450,000 ($ in [...] dollars). After a <b>title</b> <b>search</b> was completed, the deed transferred on March 1, 1951. Included among the furnishings in the home were several Gobelins, Flemish, and French tapestries and {{a large amount of}} period furniture. After some renovations to bring the structure in line with current fire codes, the Washington Club occupied the building on November 8, 1951. The club rented out the second and third floor bedrooms and their associated suites of rooms to club members. The third reception room, once Felicia Gizycka's bedroom and known as the Countess Room, was renamed the [...] "Dorothy Betts Marvin Room" [...] in honor of Washington Club president Dorothy Marvin, wife of George Washington University president Cloyd H.

2500|$|Title {{insurers}} {{conduct a}} <b>title</b> <b>search</b> on public records before {{they agree to}} insure the purchaser or mortgagee of land. [...] Specifically, after a real estate sales contract has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home's title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, {{will be required to}} fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.|$|E
