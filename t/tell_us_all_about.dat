60|$|DORA. Now, the {{curtains}} are drawn, and the fire's bright and here's your arm-chair--and you're to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> what you promised.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She has, then,' {{said the}} doctor, looking at Sister Constance. 'I thought so. Now, {{be a good}} child, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must be so}} {{interesting}} to do good," [...] Louise said, artlessly. [...] "After dinner, Mr. Brooks, will you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Matteo {{has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it, Francis, and that he, and {{everyone}} else, owed their {{escape from the}} dungeons of Genoa entirely to your cleverness." ...|$|R
60|$|The stage Irishman {{is always}} doing the most {{wonderful}} things imaginable. We do not see him do those wonderful things. He does them when nobody is by and <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> them afterward: that is how we know of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's a good name," [...] said Oliver. [...] "How do {{you like}} 'Iceberg Castle'? Jonas was <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the icebergs the other evening; and I read a story, about a famous 'Ice Palace' in Russia; how {{do you like}} that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Conway," [...] Mr. Withers {{said when}} they had {{finished}} breakfast, [...] "please take pity on us and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{then it is}} all right,' said Reginald, 'and I {{found it}} out. Now, Marianne, {{there is a good}} girl, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. I {{shall be}} glad {{to be able to}} believe that there is some redeeming feature in this strange business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} glad to see you--my sister Ada and myself," [...] Miss Kingston said, shaking hands cordially with their visitor. [...] "Lucy has been <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> you; but we {{certainly}} expected, from what you had gone through, that you were older." ...|$|R
6000|$|After thus {{overwhelming}} us {{with the}} extent of his information he slipped out of the cabin. The mate observed regretfully that he [...] "could not account for that young fellow's whims." [...] What prevented him <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it at once, he wanted to know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, there's a bit for {{yourself}}, old boy. Sit {{down and}} enjoy yourself while Jack <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> {{his interview with}} royalty," [...] said Peterkin, handing a lump of tobacco to our guide, whose eyes glistened and white teeth gleamed as he received the much-prized gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fancy {{his coming}} back!" [...] said Mrs. Boxer, wiping her eyes. [...] "How did you escape, John? Where have you been? <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, dear father," [...] said he, {{the next}} evening, [...] "now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> some other little boy, who {{was destined to}} be a famous man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here," [...] said Nootka, {{holding out}} a piece of half-cooked blubber to the boy, [...] "sit down and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. What is the news?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he walked}} through the wood, and drew near the glade, he was dismayed to hear voices, and to see Peter Pierce leaning {{against the wall of the}} house, but Rusha came running up to him exclaiming, [...] "Oh! Stead, here is this good {{stranger}} that you met, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> brother Jeph." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{will not}} do, Mr. Pattieson," [...] {{continued}} the lady; [...] "you have, as I may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of {{work out of}} her hand. And {{if you do not}} redeem this gross error by <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} your {{position}} {{very clear to}} me," [...] said Holmes. [...] "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> now <b>all</b> <b>about</b> your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They sha'n't plague you any more, an' ef I'd 'a' {{known how}} you was feelin' I wouldn't 'a' said a word. Now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy's {{been the}} goods this trip! And, {{instead of sitting}} there as dumb as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I daresay Redgie and Marianne will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it,' said Phyllis, sighing. 'I should {{rather like}} to have seen it, but they will tell us.' ...|$|E
60|$|During that memorable passage, in the Sissie, {{which took}} about two days, he volunteered other hints--for {{you could not}} call it information--about his history. And Davidson was {{interested}}. He was interested not because the hints were exciting but because of that innate curiosity about our fellows which is a trait of human nature. Davidson's existence, too, running the Sissie along the Java Sea and back again, was distinctly monotonous and, in a sense, lonely. He never had any sort of company on board. Native deck-passengers in plenty, of course, but never a white man, so the presence of Heyst for two days {{must have been a}} godsend. Davidson was <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it afterwards. Heyst said that his father had written a lot of books. He was a philosopher.|$|R
5000|$|In Feminism is for Everybody, bell hooks expresses {{her enthusiasm}} for {{spreading}} feminist ideals to everyone to prevent stereotypes and give people new perspectives on feminism. Hooks argues that feminism {{needs to be}} shared through many sources of media so that the ideals of feminism are easily accessible to everyone. Feminist theory {{can be found in}} children's literature. Hooks states, [...] "There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics". Feminist children's literature provides one form of this easy to read media. It either acts to highlight females and educate people about the history of women, or it acts to subtly give ideas of reversed gender roles where a female character might have more power.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are holding}} an Inquest," [...] Lady Muriel said, {{advancing}} to meet us: [...] "and we admit you, as Accessories before the Fact, to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> you know <b>about</b> those flowers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you lads fix up a bit; {{then come}} out and meet my family and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> your adventure. By that time dinner will be ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{us have a}} look {{round and}} see what they are doing," [...] Harry said. [...] "Ah! here comes Hunting Dog. He will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{another voice}} said. [...] "Then {{we will take}} him with us. He is an officer, and {{will be able to}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> their strength.|$|E
6000|$|Giovio <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. Cantarella, {{he calls}} it--Cantharides. Why Cantarella? Possibly {{because it is}} a pleasing, mellifluous word that will help a {{sentence}} hang together smoothly; possibly because the notorious aphrodisiac properties of that drug suggested it to Giovio as just the poison to be kept handy by folk addicted to the pursuits which he and others attribute to the Borgias. Can you surmise any better reason? For observe that Giovio describes the Cantarella for you--a blunder of his which gives the lie to his statement. [...] "A white powder of a faint and not unpleasing savour," [...] says he; and that, as you know, is nothing like cantharides, which is green, intensely acrid, and burning. Yet who cares for such discrepancies? Who will ever question anything that is uttered against a Borgia? [...] "Cantarella--a white powder of a faint and not unpleasing savour," [...] answers excellently the steady purpose of supporting a defamation and pandering to the tastes of those who like sensations in their reading--and so, from pen to pen, from book to book it leaps, as unchallenged as it is impossible.|$|R
5000|$|Hallraker will {{be thought}} of as [...] "the other" [...] live Descendents LP. The Liveage! LP served as a sort of [...] "greatist hits" [...] album, as well as being an {{accurate}} documentary of the band in concert. But at the request of fans <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> of the songs we [...] "should have put" [...] on Liveage!, we decided to release another album with a completely different set of songs, giving people the entire view of the band, with nothing held back.|$|R
5000|$|Katalin Balog defends a {{constitutional}} account of phenomenal concepts, in which [...] "token experiences serve as modes of {{presentation of the}} phenomenal properties they instantiate." [...] For instance, the concept of pain is partly constituted by a token experience of pain. She claims this position helps resolve the explanatory gap because an a priori description alone doesn't suffice to express the concept; in addition, a direct experiential constitution is required. While it seems like physical/functional information <b>about</b> [...] <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> there is <b>about</b> it, we feel something more for phenomenality because we [...] "have a 'substantive' grasp of its nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell us more, tell us more!" [...] the men cried, {{when the}} uproar ceased. [...] "We have {{seven or eight}} hours to wait for food; <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is 'e? 'Nother Colonial rebel to be 'orribly disenfranchised, or a Cape Minister, or only a loyal farmer with {{dynamite}} in both boots. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it, Burjer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-night," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{would not}} be possible. General Dolinski is dining at Marlborough House, and De Broullae is in Paris. Now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Brott." ...|$|E
40|$|Observing the {{violation}} of Bell's inequality <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> something <b>about</b> <b>all</b> possible future theories: they must all predict nonlocal correlations. Hence Nature is nonlocal. After an elementary introduction to nonlocality and {{a brief review of}} some recent experiments, I argue that Nature's nonlocality together with the existence of free will is incompatible with the many-worlds view of quantum physics.

6000|$|... 'He {{sat down}} upon {{one of the}} seats, and took Fly on one knee and me on the other, though we were big for it--just like papa, you know--and made <b>us</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. Lady Rotherwood got the others {{out of the way}} somehow--I don't know how, for my back was that way, and I think Ivinghoe went after them, but there was some use in talking to Cousin Rotherwood; he has got some sense, and knows what one means, as if he was at the dear, nice playing age, and Ivinghoe was his stupid old father in a book.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Bart Ehrman {{concludes that}} {{historical}} evidence <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> nothing at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Jesus' sexuality—"certainly nothing {{to indicate that}} Jesus and Mary had a sexual relationship of any kind". Ehrman (a scholar of the Greek New Testament and Early Christianity) says that the question people ask him most often is whether Mary Magdalene and Jesus of Nazareth married each other: [...] "It is not true that the Dead Sea Scrolls contained Gospels that discussed Mary and Jesus. (...) Nor {{is it true that}} the marriage of Mary and Jesus is repeatedly discussed in the Gospels that didn't make it into the New Testament. In fact, it is never discussed at all—never even mentioned, not even once. (...) It is not true that the Gospel of Philip calls Mary Jesus' spouse." ...|$|R
