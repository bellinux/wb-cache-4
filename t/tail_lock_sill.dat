The selection of moving targets is considerably more difficult and error prone than traditional stationary target selection. In this paper, we introduce Comet <b>Tails</b> and Target <b>Lock,</b> two techniques that support the selection of moving targets. Our goal is to facilitate accurate and fast selection of moving targets. We compare our two techniques to unassisted selection in a controlled experiment. The results show that for moving target selection, Comet <b>Tails</b> and Target <b>Lock</b> can outperform unassisted selection, and result in fewer errors. According to post-experiment questionnaires, participants indicate a stronger preference for assisted target selection with Comet <b>Tails</b> and Target <b>Lock</b> than unassisted selection...|$|R

40|$|The {{signaling}} {{output of}} protein kinase C (PKC) is exquisitely controlled, with its disruption resulting in pathophysiologies. Identifying the structural basis for autoinhibition {{is central to}} developing effective therapies for cancer, where PKC activity needs to be enhanced, or neurodegenerative diseases, where PKC activity should be inhibited. Here, we reinterpret a previously reported crystal structure of PKCβII and use docking and functional analysis to propose an alternative structure {{that is consistent with}} previous literature on PKC regulation. Mutagenesis of predicted contact residues establishes that the Ca 2 +-sensing C 2 domain interacts intramolecularly with the kinase domain and the carboxyl-terminal <b>tail,</b> <b>locking</b> PKC in an inactive conformation. Ca 2 +-dependent bridging of the C 2 domain to membranes provides the first step in activating PKC via conformational selection. Although the placement of the C 1 domains remains to be determined, elucidation of the structural basis for autoinhibition of PKCβII unveils a unique direction for therapeutically targeting PKC...|$|R
50|$|The Warwick and Napton Canal and the Birmingham and Warwick Canal both faced stiff {{competition}} from the railways, and declared themselves bankrupt in the early 1850s. The companies were reconstituted by the receiver, and continued to trade. From 1917, they were managed jointly, and on 1 January 1929, were sold to the Regent's Canal, and with the Grand Junction Canal, {{became part of the}} Grand Union Canal. In order to effectively compete, the new company wanted to upgrade the canals so that wide barges could be used between London and Birmingham. Their aim was to accommodate barges 12.5 ft wide immediately, and ultimately to make the route suitable for 14 ft barges. 52 locks on the two Warwick canals were converted into weirs, and 51 new locks, each 83.5 by 15 ft were built. There was one less because the flight of six at Knowle was replaced by five. In order to give a depth of 5.5 ft, the height of weirs were raised or <b>lock</b> <b>sills</b> were lowered. As part of the work, the top two locks at Bascote were made into a staircase pair. Although the Duke of Kent performed an opening ceremony on 30 October 1934 at the top lock of the Hatton flight, to mark the completion of the project, work continued until 1937. One 12.5 ft boat was built, but without widening the bottom of the canal, there were many places where two such boats could not pass, and the new locks were used by pairs of narrow boats.|$|R

5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the <b>tail</b> <b>lock</b> and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|R

On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael López-Alegría. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.|$|R

Signal termination is achieved by the action of the arrestins, which bind to activated, phosphorylated G protein–coupled receptors. We describe here crystallographic studies of visual arrestin in its basal conformation. The salient features of the structure are a bipartite molecule with an unusual polar core. This core is stabilized in part by an extended carboxy-terminal <b>tail</b> that <b>locks</b> the molecule into an inactive state. In addition, arrestin is found to be a dimer of two asymmetric molecules, suggesting an intrinsic conformational plasticity. In conjunction with biochemical and mutagenesis data, we propose a molecular mechanism by which arrestin is activated for receptor binding...|$|R

Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies, a re-designed rudder assembly to increase rudder effectiveness, Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility; these changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires, this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.|$|R

5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock.

This cause was highlighted by an article in the December 1979 edition of the waterways magazine Waterways World, which showed the state of the navigation, and noted that the long-term aim of the local branch of the IWA was restoration to navigable standards for leisure traffic. Already the group had been clearing the towpath, and this led to the setting up of the Gipping Valley River Path, a footpath from Ipswich to Stowmarket which uses the towpath for most of its route. Between 1994 and 2004, members of the IWA worked on the reconstruction of first Bosmere and then Creeting locks.

Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch.

The Pontardawe Tin Plate Works was located immediately {{to the east of}} the canal between the locks, and by 1878 was served by railway sidings which crossed the river to reach the works. Approaching Trebanos, the canal re-emerges from its culvert, to reach Trebanos Lock and Green Lock. The Pheasant Bush Tin Works beside Trebanos Lock was disused by 1898. By Coedgwilym Park, the canal turns briefly to the west, to pass under the B4603 Pontardawe Road bridge, and then there is another short culverted section beneath a council depot, which was the location of a lock. You can walk around the council depot and the drop in level between each end is quite noticeable. There are suggestions that lock 6 is still intact underneath the depot {{at the point where the}} canal drops into the culvert through large metal grids. There was a short tramway from below the lock to Ynys-penllwch Graig-ola Colliery. Mond Lock was next, with the B4603 crossing the <b>tail</b> of the <b>lock.</b> Below the bridge is the Mond Nickel Works, set up in 1900 after the chemist Dr Ludwig Mond discovered a process for producing pure nickel. Nickel ore was imported from Canada, and the site was chosen because there were supplies of anthracite coal, water, transport links to Swansea, and an available labour force. The canal crosses the Lower Clydach River on an aqueduct, which discharges water into the river, and the watered section comes to an abrupt halt about 50 yd further on.|$|R
5000|$|Kori {{bustards}} {{engage in}} lek mating. All bustards have polygynous breeding habits, {{in which one}} male displays to attract several females, and mates with them all. Males display at regularly used sites, each male utilizing several dispersed leks or display areas. These displays usually {{take place in the}} mornings and evenings. The courtship displays of the males are impressive and elaborate, successfully advertising their presence to potential mates. The males hold their heads backwards, with cheeks bulging, the crest is held erect, the bill open and they inflate their gular pouches, forming a white throat [...] "balloon". During this display the oesophagus inflates to as much as four times its normal size and resembles a balloon. They also puff out their frontal neck feathers which are splayed upwards showing their white underside. The white may be visible up to 1 km away during display. Their wings are drooped and their tails are raised upwards and forwards onto their backs like a turkey, the retrices being held vertically and their undertail coverts fluffed out. They enhance their performance with an exaggerated bouncing gait. When displaying they stride about with their necks puffed out, their tail fanned and their wings planed and pointed downward. They also emit a low-pitched booming noise when the neck is at maximum inflation and snap their bills open and shut. Several males dispersed over a wide area gather to display but usually one is dominant and the others do not display in his presence and move away. The displaying males are visited by the females who presumably select the male with the most impressive display. Occasionally fights between males can be serious during the mating season when display areas are being contested, with the two competitors smashing into each other's bodies and stabbing each other with their bills. They may stand chest-to-chest, <b>tails</b> erect, bills <b>locked</b> and 'push' one another for up to 30 minutes.|$|R
