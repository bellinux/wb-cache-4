5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan was {{released}} in North America on June 4, 1982 by Paramount Pictures. It was a box office success, earning $97 million worldwide and setting a world record for its first-day box office gross. Critical reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan's character, the film's pacing, and the character interactions as strong elements. Negative reactions, however, focused on weak special effects {{and some of the}} acting. <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan is considered by some to be the best film in the Star Trek series, and is often credited with renewing substantial interest in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the chronicle}} Madala Panji, in 318 AD, the priests and servitors {{of the temple}} {{spirited}} away the idols to escape <b>the</b> <b>wrath</b> <b>of</b> the Rashtrakuta king Rakatavahu.

5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, Tantallon again saw {{military}} action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639.

5|$|At {{no point}} during <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens.

Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of John Steinbeck’s novel <b>The</b> Grapes <b>of</b> <b>Wrath</b> conducted using structuralism approach. The result shows that the meaning of family in <b>The</b> Grapes <b>of</b> <b>Wrath</b> has two supporting dimensions. First, a family is nuclear family consisting of a father, mother and children. They live as a household and in one house. Sometimes, they consider extended family particularly grandfather, grand-mother, uncles, and others. Second, a family {{is a group of}} people with same back-grounds and problems. In <b>The</b> Grapes <b>of</b> <b>Wrath,</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> family dramati-cally is gained from their family bond and togetherness at Route 66...|$|R

5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals.

She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{released}} <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan on VHS and Beta in 1983. The studio {{sold the}} VHS for $39.95, $40 below contemporary movie cassette prices. It needed to sell 60,000 tapes {{to make the}} film as profitable as other tapes, but sold 120,000. The successful experiment was credited with instigating more competitive VHS pricing, {{an increase in the}} adoption of increasingly cheaper VHS players, and an industry-wide move away from rentals to sales as the bulk of videotape revenue.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan {{opened on}} June 4, 1982 in 1,621 theaters in the United States. It made $14,347,221 in its opening weekend, {{at the time}} the largest opening weekend gross in history. It went on to earn $78,912,963 in the US, {{becoming}} the sixth highest-grossing film of 1982. It made $97,000,000 worldwide. Although the total gross of <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan was less than that of The Motion Picture, it was more profitable due to its lower production cost. The film's novelization, written by Vonda N. McIntyre, stayed on the New York Times paperback bestsellers list for more than three weeks. Unlike the previous film, Wrath of Khan was not promoted with a toy line, although Playmates Toys created Khan and Saavik figures in the 1990s, and in 2007 Art Asylum crafted a full series of action figures to mark the film's 25th anniversary. In 2009 IDW Publishing released a comic adaptation of the film, and Film Score Monthly released an expanded score.|$|E
