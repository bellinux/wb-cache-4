5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{signing of}} the Split Agreementa mutual defence agreementby Tuđman and the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović in Split on 22 July, {{permitting}} large-scale deployments of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Besides Tuđman and Izetbegović, the agreement was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Krešimir Zubak, and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Haris Silajdžić. It was mediated by Demirel. The agreement specifically stated that Croatia requested urgent military aid, especially for the Bihać area, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> to the agreement intended to coordinate their military activities. The full title of the Split Agreement, or Split Declaration, is Declaration on implementation of the Washington Agreement, joint defence against Serb aggression and achievement of a political solution {{in accordance with the}} efforts of the international community (Deklaracija o oživotvorenju Sporazuma iz Washingtona, zajedničkoj obrani od srpske agresije i postizanju političkog rješenja sukladno naporima međunarodne zajednice).|$|E

25|$|Hungry Jack's {{also argued}} that the Development Agreement {{included}} an implied term of good faith (that is, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> must act in good faith when exercising their rights under the contract), and that Burger King had breached this term by denying the financial and operating approval to new restaurants, leading to Hungry Jack's failing to meet the minimum stores requirement.

25|$|No final {{agreement}} was reached on July 19, but the electrical workers union agreed to admit two African American apprentices. The iron workers and sheet metal workers agreed to take similar action. The talks were productive enough <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> agreed to meet on July 20. At a six-hour session, attended by Slaiman and Cicero Scott of the U.S. Department of Labor, the plumbers union agreed to process 15 or 16 journeymen applications for craftsman membership. Plumbing contractor Smith & Oby agreed to hire at least two black journeymen as well.|$|E
25|$|Newspaper reports {{mention that}} Chang dealt {{exclusively}} with young women. One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note to pretty girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them and {{would like to have a}} quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant that he was able to build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> were invisible to each other.|$|E

25|$|In a 1988 status conference, it {{surfaced}} in a <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> had not resolved a disagreement {{about whether a}} separate court order was necessary for the arbitration to commence.

It {{turned out that the}} order had not specified the forum under which the arbitration was to take place. While the original contract had specified the NYSE, the McMahons responded to the order with a motion in state court to enjoin the arbitration and instead allow them to arbitrate the case before the American Arbitration Association (AAA), per the rules of the American Stock Exchange, instead.|$|E
25|$|These {{plans were}} scuttled {{by the death}} of Edward VII on 6 May 1910. Asquith and his ministers were {{initially}} reluctant to press the new king, George V, in mourning for his father, for commitments on constitutional change, and the monarch's views were not yet known. With a strong feeling in the country <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> should compromise, Asquith and other Liberals met with Conservative leaders in a number of conferences through much of the remainder of 1910. These talks failed in November over Conservative insistence that there be no limits on the Lords's ability to veto Irish Home Rule. When the Parliament Bill was submitted to the Lords, they made amendments that were not acceptable to the government.|$|E
25|$|After Kilroy-Silk's defection, UKIP's {{membership}} {{declined by}} a third and donations dropped by over a half. UKIP continued to be widely seen as a single-issue party and in the 2005 general election—when it fielded 496 candidates—it secured only 2.2% of the vote, and 40 candidates had their deposits returned. Electoral support for the BNP grew during this period, with academics and political commentators suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> were largely competing for the same voter base, a section of about 20% of the UK population. Given that the BNP had outperformed UKIP {{in most of the}} seats that they both contested, many UKIP members, including several figures on the NEC, favoured an electoral pact with them, a proposal that Farage strongly condemned.|$|E

25|$|While {{all five}} judges are {{properly}} seen {{as among the}} framers of the Constitution, it was Higgins J who had taken {{a leading role in the}} Constitutional Conventions for the federal government the power to make laws relating to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. As with the judgement of Isaacs J in Whybrow (No 1), Higgins J argues from the premise that the fundamental basis of the Australian legal system was that power was conferred on the Federal Parliament, not by the people of Australia but by the British parliament. Higgins J rejected the premise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> to the dispute needed to have taken a definite stand or made definite claims, but that an order or award could not be made except as against identified or identifiable parties.|$|E
25|$|The second {{approach}} {{fell into}} the category of conditional marriages, t'nai b'kiddushin, and was based in part on past approaches used by both the French and Turkish rabbinates—but, according to Rabinowitz—had improvements gleaned from lessons learned from those past experiences. The ketubah was not changed, but a separate pre-marital agreement was signed, and {{in the presence of the}} rabbinical court, the prospective groom read it, and the prospective bride stated that she agreed to it. The agreement was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> understood that if a civil divorce were ever granted, then a get must be delivered within six months of that date. A refusal to abide by that agreement would give the court no choice but to consider the original marriage, and the original declaration of the groom, so flawed that it would be as if that marriage never occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race.

They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as we have seen, that denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E
