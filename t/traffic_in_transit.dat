5000|$|The Quadrilateral <b>Traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> Agreement (QTTA) is {{a transit}} trade deal between China, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan for facilitating transit traffic and trade. Recently, Tajikistan has {{expressed}} interest in joining the deal. The initial work on this road project was initiated in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Kichmengsky Gorodok {{is located}} on the paved road which connects Kotlas and Veliky Ustyug in the north and Nikolsk and Manturovo in the south. Another, unpaved, road connects Kichmengsky Gorodok with Podosinovets in Kirov Oblast. There is bus <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> as well as local bus traffic {{originating}} from Kichmengsky Gorodok.|$|E
50|$|Monorails were {{developed}} to meet medium-demand <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> urban <b>transit,</b> and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a relatively {{small part of the}} overall railway field.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{engineering}} interdomain <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> large <b>transit</b> ASes is {{a difficult}} task due the opacity of BGP and the complex interactions between the BGP decision process and IGP routing. In this paper we propose Tweak-it, a tool that, based on the steady-state view of BGP routing inside the AS and the traffic demands of the AS, computes the BGP updates {{to be sent to}} the ingress routers of a transit AS to traffic engineer its interdomain traffic over time...|$|R
50|$|A tunnel broker {{provides}} IPv6 connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> IPv4 Internet <b>transit</b> links, typically using 6in4. This establishes IPv6 tunnels {{within the}} IPv4 Internet. The tunnels may be managed with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) or AYIYA. The first tunnel brokers were demonstrated in February 1999.|$|R
50|$|This {{vulnerability}} can {{be exploited}} {{through the use}} of a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker may be able to decrypt and modify <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted handshake to force the use of weak keying material. Successful exploitation could lead to a security bypass condition where an attacker could gain access to potentially sensitive information. The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client and server.|$|E
50|$|During the November 2015 {{visit of}} Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon to Pakistan, the Tajik premier also {{expressed}} his government's desire {{to join the}} Quadrilateral Agreement on <b>Traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> to use CPEC and Gwadar Port as a conduit for imports and exports to Tajikistan by circumventing Afghanistan; the request received political backing by the Pakistani Prime Minister. The Pamir Highway already provides Tajikistan access to Kashgar via the Kulma Pass. These crossings complement the CPEC project to provide Central Asian states access to Pakistan's seaports in Gwadar and Karachi by completely bypassing Afghanistan - a country which has been ravaged by civil war and political instability since the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The {{heads of}} various Central Asian republics have {{expressed}} {{their desire to}} connect their infrastructure networks to the CPEC project via China. During the August 2015 visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Kazakhstan, the Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov, conveyed Kazakhstan's desire to link its road network to the CPEC project. During the November 2015 visit of Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon to Pakistan, the Tajik premier also expressed his government's desire to join the Quadrilateral Agreement on <b>Traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> to use CPEC as a conduit for imports and exports to Tajikistan by circumventing Afghanistan; the request received political backing by the Pakistani Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 May 2001, {{in order}} to secure their future, the BLS and SBB agreed on a new task-sharing arrangement. This was largely {{implemented}} as part of the timetable changes made on 12 December 2004 when the BLS took over the running of the SBB's S-Bahn lines and with it, system responsibility for Bern's S-Bahn network, the second largest in the country. This was accompanied by the transfer of long-distance railway operations from the BLS to the SBB. Within the cargo sector the SBB assumed overall control for full-load <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland. <b>Transit</b> and block train traffic has been subject to competition since the signing of the 2001 agreement. The SBB became responsible for rail network management across Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|After 1990, most of {{the street}} {{buildings}} have undergone repair and restoration. Since 2008 the [...] "August Cieszkowski Street Residents Association" [...] organizes its annual festival [...] "U-Rodziny Augusta Cieszkowskiego" [...] (In the Family of August Cieszkowski), promoting cultural integration and bringing street residents and tourists. In 2011, the municipal council decided, {{as part of the}} revitalization plans, to build a parallel street, [...] "Nowomazowieckiej St.", which should relieve the heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>transit</b> <b>in</b> Cieszkowski Street.|$|R
5000|$|Traffic on the {{motorway}} {{has increased}} considerably since the 1950s and now creates a significant noise problem for some homes near the motorway and {{adds to the}} general noise <b>in</b> the valley. <b>Traffic</b> is now well above the level where noise mitigation would be required {{if this was a}} new motorway construction or above levels where noise mitigation would be required due to increased <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> other countries. <b>Transit</b> New Zealand has resisted noise mitigating using the dubious argument of [...] "existing use" [...] despite the significant traffic increase and most of the homes existing before the motorway opened.|$|R
50|$|The Pakistani {{government}} {{continued to}} be frustrated by Afghanistan's refusal to allow Pakistani goods access to Central Asian markets until Afghan exports were granted reciprocal access to Indian markets. Owing to this frustration, and ongoing construction of roadway projects to China under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Pakistani Government in February 2016 signalled its intention to completely bypass Afghanistan in its quest to access Central Asia by announcing its intent to revive the Quadrilateral Agreement on <b>Traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> so that Central Asian states could access Pakistani ports via Kashgar instead of Afghanistan, thereby allowing the Central Asian republics to access Pakistan's deep water ports without having {{to rely on a}} politically unstable Afghanistan as a transit corridor. However, the QTTA would not allow Pakistan access to Turkmenistan and Iran across Afghan territory as the APTTA does.|$|E
40|$|Careful {{examination}} of the composition and concentration of malicious <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> on the channels of the Internet provides network administrators with a means of understanding and predicting damaging attacks directed towards their networks. This allows for {{action to be taken}} to mitigate the effect that these attacks have on the performance of their networks and the Internet as a whole by readying network defences and providing early warning to Internet users. One approach to malicious traffic monitoring that has garnered some success in recent times, as exhibited by the study of fast spreading Internet worms, involves analysing data obtained from network telescopes. While some research has considered using measures derived from network telescope datasets to study large scale network incidents such as Code-Red, SQLSlammer and Conficker, there is very little documented discussion on the merits and weaknesses of approaches to analyzing network telescope data. This thesis is an introductory study in network telescope analysis and aims to consider the variables associated with the data received by network telescopes and how these variables may be analysed. The core research of this thesis considers both novel and previously explored analysis techniques from the fields of security metrics, baseline analysis, statistical analysis and technical analysis as applied to analysing network telescope datasets. These techniques were evaluated as approaches to recognize unusual behaviour by observing the ability of these techniques to identify notable incidents in network telescope dataset...|$|E
3000|$|To {{implement}} our jammer on an 802.11 legacy node in NS, we set the CCA threshold to a {{very high}} value (0 dBm). By this way, the device will ignore all the <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> over the wireless medium. NS tool, such as [...] "threshold,” {{has been used to}} find that packets always arrive at the jammer’s circuitry with power < 0 dBm even if the distances between the jammer and the legitimate transceivers are very small. We ensure the jammer continuously transmitting packets on the medium by developing a specified MAC layer utility. With this, the jammer continuously broadcasts UDP packets. Given that the backoff functionality is by default disabled in 802.11 for broadcast traffic, our specified utility can ensure that packets are sent as fast as possible. With such transmissions the jammer does not wait for any ACK packets. To summarize, our jammer utility consists of a specific NIC configuration that sets CCA[*]=[*] 0 and a specified utility for continuously generating and transmitting broadcast packets. In the following simulations, we implement two or ten randomly distributed jamming nodes in the network, respectively, each of which has a jamming range of 50 [*]m. The traffic-generating rates of the jammers are randomly from 0.2 to 0.8 Mbps. There are ten flows in the network with randomly selected sources and destinations. All the flows have the same traffic demand of 1 Mbp. And in the simulated MHWN, 100 wireless nodes are randomly deployed over a 1000 [*]×[*] 500 [*]m 2 region. Each node has a transmission range of 250 [*]m and an interference range of 350 [*]m.|$|E
30|$|Once {{the set of}} surrogates {{have been}} {{selected}} and end user to surrogate assignment has been completed, we compute content distribution paths among origin and surrogate servers, by using a shortest path algorithm taking into consideration capacity constraints of the underlying physical network. Communication demands in the physical network graph are defined by end-user request pattern (request rate and size) as well as cache misses. The selected content distribution paths determine also the set of servers {{to be used for}} relaying <b>traffic</b> (<b>transits)</b> <b>in</b> the resulting CDN.|$|R
40|$|International <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> persons {{is often}} {{facilitated}} by the movement of victims through one or more <b>transit</b> countries <b>in</b> order to reach a destination country where the victim will ultimately be subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour. Despite this recognized pattern, {{there has been a}} relative lack of attention paid to the response of <b>transit</b> countries <b>in</b> addressing their role in this transnational criminal activity and systematic human rights abuse. This working paper begins by identifying several characteristics common to transit countries, including: (1) geographic proximity by land, sea, or air to attractive destination countries; (2) insufficient legislation and weak enforcement against <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> persons and migrant smuggling; (3) liberal immigration policies; and (4) an operational criminal infrastructure to facilitate illegal entry to, and exit from, a country. The case study of Canada as a transit country to the United States is presented, both to better understand the nature of the problem between these two jurisdictions and to explore the responses that officials have provided to date. Transit countries face heightened challenges compared to origin and destination countries, particularly with respect to distinguishing between trafficked persons and smuggled migrants. By synthesizing the legal obligations in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air into terms that are relevant to transit countries, a comprehensive set of standards emerge to enhance their ability to prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers and protect victims. Policies and programs that have been adopted by some transit countries are then highlighted, demonstrating how these standards can be implemented to engage <b>transit</b> countries <b>in</b> a more comprehensive response to <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> persons. While Canada and the United States have undertaken important bilateral efforts to combat <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> persons, the following recommendations are proposed to improve their joint response, including: 1. Increase training and capacity of border officials to identify potential <b>trafficking</b> victims <b>in</b> transit; 2. Continue to cooperate in joint enforcement activities to disrupt illegal movement across the shared border; 3. Enhance mutual legal assistance and engage <b>in</b> cross-border human <b>trafficking</b> investigations and prosecutions to dismantle the entire network involved in identified cases; 4. Ensure victims of human <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> are afforded assistance and protection, including support made increasingly available through enhanced cross-border cooperation between governmental and non-governmental victim support organizations; 5. Build public awareness in border areas about human trafficking, the needs of victims, and information on where to report suspicious activity; and 6. Cooperate with major source countries as well as enhance trilateral cooperation between Canada, the United States, and Mexico to prevent human trafficking. Number of Pages in PDF File: 10...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{consensus}} algorithm with input constraints for <b>traffic</b> light signals <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> signal priority (TSP). TSP ensures control strategy of traffic light signals {{can be adjusted}} and applied according to the real-time traffic status, and provides priority for buses. We give the convergence conditions of the consensus algorithms with and without input constraints in TSP respectively and analyze the convergence performance of them by using matrix theory and graph theory, and PTV-VISSIM is used to simulate the traffic accident probability of three cases at intersections. Simulation results are presented that a consensus is asymptotically reached for all weights of priority; the algorithm with input constraints is more suitable for TSP than the algorithm without input constraints, and the traffic accident rate is reduced...|$|R
3000|$|Clausen and Voll [4] {{conclude}} that the North American railroads are able to move wagons through their networks relatively much cheaper than in Europe. They fail to develop or address the major contextual differences including ownership, governance, absence of intensive passenger traffic and the retention of many rail linked sidings, and spurs that can support a many-to-many set of routing options. Equally the absence of restricting international borders and longer sector lengths is passed over. Rail in North America is not particularly competitive or effective at sector lengths of less than 500 miles and has abandoned or been driven out of sector length flows of this distance or less. Movement costs are {{claimed to be a}} lower proportion of total costs in North America. The focus on individual car movement costs disaggregates the decision making process down but neglects the routine commercial position where wagons/freight cars are moved in groups or blocks from a common point to a common destination where this degree of detail, whilst useful, for management and commercial purposes can be irrelevant or unnecessary. The focus on individual car costs as the primary routing decision making item potentially drives routing solutions to constrained paths or routes which can then trigger issues of capacity and cargo priority. The reality of shipper revisions of <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> changes in routing preference, scheduling, equipment types {{and a host of other}} practical issues are not discussed yet they have a major bearing on the reality of moving rail freight. [...]. The deletion of the need to move wagons/freight cars through classification yards is an increasingly common trend with pre-formed blocks of wagons grouped into formations but is not discussed or elaborated upon.|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : Resource AllocationInternational audienceAs {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) applications (e. g. BitTorrent) impose {{high costs}} to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) {{due to the}} large volumes of inter-domain traffic generated, extensive research {{work has been done}} concerning locality-awareness approaches. Although such approaches are based on properties of the physical network topology, they take very little consideration of the real business relationships between ISPs (peering and transit agreements) {{as well as of the}} heterogeneous peer distributions among ISPs. In this paper, we propose an innovative way to exploit the business relationships between ISPs of either the same or different Tiers, by introducing new collaborative approaches for overlay traffic management on top of the locality-awareness ones. By means of simulations, we show that win-win situation (reduced transit traffic for ISPs and better performance for users) can mostly be achieved under certain complicated collaborative approaches. Also we show how the collaboration between the upper Tier ISPs can affect favorably both the inter-domain <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> the <b>transit</b> links, where charging applies, and the performance of their customers ISPs and how the latter can benefit from their collaboration with the transit ISPs...|$|R

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{can be used}} {{to represent}} a transit system: the line approach where all runs belonging to the same line are simulated in a single infrastructure line; the run approach where the single runs are explicitly simulated. Assignment models simulate how origin-destination demand flows affect link flows and resulting performance. <b>Traffic</b> assignment models <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> systems are generally made up by two different h 4.

In this paper the diachronic strategy approach for low frequency systems and the hyperpath approach are applied and compared in the extra-urban supply system of Reggio Calabria (extraurban administrative district of Reggio Calabria).

40|$|Network {{monitoring}} allows network {{managers to}} get a better insight <b>in</b> the network <b>traffic</b> <b>transiting</b> <b>in</b> a managed network. In order to make the tasks of a network manager easier, many network monitoring tools are made available {{for a wide range of}} purposes (e. g., traffic accounting, performance analysis, and so on) network managers may have. However, most of these tools lack to provide geographical information about network traffic. This paper presents a network monitoring tool prototype, called SURFmap, which provides network traffic information at a geographical dimension by using the Google Maps API. Through the use of the Google Maps API’s features, SURFmap provides different zoom levels when showing network information, which results in the creation of different levels of abstraction in the network data visualization. SURFmap has revealed to be more intuitive when showing network traffic information, which makes the network monitoring activity from the network manager’s perspective more interesting...|$|R
5000|$|Three of the Southern Pacific's {{electric}} lines {{met at the}} [...] "Colusa Wye": the Ninth Street line, the California Street line, and the Shattuck Avenue line. On {{the north}} side of this junction, the Southern Pacific constructed an electric sub-station whose legacy survives {{in the name of a}} small cul-de-sac behind the former site of the building (now demolished). The junction was also the terminus of the three lines, called [...] "Thousand Oaks Station". After the SP abandoned its electric trains in 1941, the rival Key System took over the tracks of the Shattuck Avenue line through the Northbrae Tunnel, but terminating at a stop east of The Alameda. The tracks on Solano were paved over and the catenary wires removed. Until the early 2000s, the trace of these tracks was still visible in the pavement on Solano adjacent to Colusa. After the Key System abandoned it's train service to San Francisco in 1958, and upon the opening of the Northbrae Tunnel to auto <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> 1963, AC <b>Transit</b> ran its F and 33 bus lines to the former Key System stop east of The Alameda, with alternate runs continuing down Solano to a terminus at San Pablo.|$|R

40|$|To {{simulate}} a transit system two approaches can be used: a line approach where all runs {{belonging to the}} same line are simulated in a single infrastructure line; a run approach where the single runs are explicitly simulated. Assignment models simulate how origin-destination demand flows affect link flows and resulting performances. <b>Traffic</b> assignment models <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> systems are generally made up by two different approaches: a frequency approach for high frequency services to simulate the user’s behaviour and considering line approach to simulate the supply; a schedule-based approach for low frequency services to simulate the user’s behaviour and considering run approach to simulate the supply. Recently the schedule-based approach has undergone great advances in terms of models, procedures and commercial software and with current performance {{it could also be}} used for simulating high frequency services. Currently, many practical applications are being developed using frequency approach, also for low frequency services. In this paper the shortcomings of the frequency approach using optimal strategy compared with the schedule-based approach are investigated <b>in</b> simulating extra-urban <b>transit</b> system <b>in</b> terms of user behaviour simulation and subsequently verifying a numerical application. The two approaches are applied to the extra-urban supply system of the province of Reggio Calabria. In the province there are about 570, 000 inhabitants and the supply has more than 1300 runs a day. The results obtained with the schedule-based approach are discussed and compared. Pros and cons of each approach are discussed...|$|R
