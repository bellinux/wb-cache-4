5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands. The breeding population had begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nest, with fatal results.|$|E

500|$|Most reviewers {{praised the}} risk of {{changing}} up the gameplay of Guitar Hero with the new controller design, contrasting to Rock Band 4s reliance on its established gameplay mechanics. Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the change a reinvention of the series, and though he had to relearn {{how to play the}} controller, enjoyed the experience and [...] "the increased emphasis on chords and fancy finger-work". Griffin McElroy of Polygon also praised the new controller, finding that the higher difficulties in the game present [...] "the most challenging fake guitar-playing" [...] that he's seen, and having to relearn the new playing style through the game's difficulties levels was a [...] "delight". Matt Miller of Game Informer found the six-button layout was not any better than the traditional five-button one, but [...] "nails a different dynamic" [...] as it feel like one was playing more realistic guitar chords. Though Game Revolutions Nick Tan was impressed with the challenge of the new controller, he felt the buttons themselves were too small and <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neck of the controller, and the new challenge may cause more casual players to forgo attempt to learn the new system and go back to Rock Band and the traditional layout.|$|E

60|$|In {{his last}} years, the Great Elector, worn out with labor, and harassed with such {{domestic}} troubles over and above, had evidently fallen much under his Wife's management; cutting out large apanages (clear against the GERA BOND) for her children;--longing probably for quiet {{in his family}} at any price. As to the poor young Prince, negotiated back from Cassel, he lived remote, and had fallen into open disfavor,--with a very ill effect upon his funds, for one thing. His father kept him somewhat <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> money-side, it is alleged; and he had rather a turn for spending money handsomely. He was also in some alarm about the proposed apanages to his Half-brothers, the Margraves above mentioned, of which there were rumors going.|$|E

60|$|The bugles blew for {{the death}} of the bull. Ordonez stood forth with the sword and the scarlet cloth. But the bull had changed again, {{and did not want to}} fight. Ordonez stamped his foot in the sand, and cried out, and waved the scarlet cloth. Then the bull charged, but without heart. There was no weight to the charge. It was a poor thrust. The sword struck a bone and bent. Ordonez took a fresh sword. The bull, again stung to fight, charged once more. Five times Ordonez essayed the thrust, and each time the sword went but part way in or struck bone. The sixth time, the sword went in to the hilt. But it was a bad thrust. The sword missed the heart and stuck out half a yard through the ribs on the {{opposite}} side. The audience hissed the matador. I glanced at John Harned. He sat silent, without movement; but I could see his teeth were set, and his hands were clenched <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railing of the box.|$|E
6000|$|After dinner {{there was}} a long and {{somewhat}} tedious interval of [...] smoking and story-telling in the dark, and we called upon Lacaita [...] to recite Italian poetry, which he did with much effect, pouring [...] out sonnet after sonnet of Petrarch, including that which my father [...] thinks the most beautiful in the Italian language, that which has [...] in it the 'Campeggiar del angelico riso.' This showed me how easy [...] it was to fall into the habits of a country. Gladstone is as [...] unoriental as any man well can be, yet his calling on Lacaita to [...] recite was really just the same thing that every Pasha does after [...] dinner, when he orders his tale-teller to repeat a story. The [...] ladies meanwhile were packed off to the harem for the night, Lady [...] Bowen acting as their interpreter. My L.H.C., his two [...] secretaries, his three aide-de-camps, Captains Blomfield and [...] Clanricarde, and the vice-consul, all slept in the same room, and [...] that not a large one, and we were packed <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, under [...] quilts of Brusa silk and gold, tucked up round us by gorgeous [...] Albanians.
