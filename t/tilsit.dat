5|$|Control of the Adriatic brought {{numerous}} {{advantages to}} the French Navy, allowing rapid transit of troops from Italy to the Balkans and Austria for campaigning {{in the east}} and giving France possession of numerous shipbuilding facilities, particularly the large naval yards of Venice. From 1807, when the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> precipitated a Russian withdrawal from the Septinsular Republic, the French Navy held naval supremacy in the region. The Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> also contained a secret clause that guaranteed French assistance in any war fought between the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. To fulfil this clause, Napoleon would have to secure his supply lines to the east by developing the French armies in Illyria. This required control of the Adriatic against increasingly aggressive British raiders. The Royal Navy determined to stop these troop convoys from reaching Illyria and sought to break French hegemony in the region, resulting in a six-year naval campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars, {{the name}} for a {{succession}} of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor Napoleon and his European opponents, were nine years old when the War of the Fifth Coalition ended in 1809. The Treaty of Schönbrunn that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the Illyrian Provinces. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole Adriatic Sea since the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> in 1807. In the Treaty of <b>Tilsit,</b> Russia had granted France control over the Septinsular Republic and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic. At Schönbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan France and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring Kingdom of Italy which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule. Thus, the Treaty of Schönbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, {{would allow him to}} transport troops and supplies to the Balkans. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the Ottoman Empire in conjunction with the Russians; the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at <b>Tilsit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexander faced {{pressure}} from his brother, Duke Constantine, {{to make peace}} with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at <b>Tilsit</b> caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of <b>Tilsit</b> at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of <b>Tilsit</b> of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at <b>Tilsit</b> in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was {{under pressure from the}} Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain on {{the relationship between the two}} nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at {{the savage}} and indecisive Battle of Eylau, which left behind between 30,000–50,000 casualties. Napoleon regrouped his forces {{after the battle}} and {{continued}} to pursue the Russians in upcoming months. The action in Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807, when the French mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent. It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco-Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the War of the Fifth Coalition in late 1809 had changed the political situation in the Adriatic, confirming French possession of the Illyrian Provinces and removing any threat to the Adriatic seaports from Austrian-held territory. It also freed the French Army to operate against the Ottoman Empire, as intended in the Treaty of <b>Tilsit.</b> It did not however affect the British frigates raiding in the Adriatic {{under the command of}} William Hoste, who was now launching coordinated raids against coastal convoys, towns and forts along the Italian coast.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the neighboring states. The Kingdom of Prussia acquired Białystok and the surrounding region during the third partition. The city became the capital of the New East Prussia province in 1795. Prussia lost the territory following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition as the resultant 1807 Treaties of <b>Tilsit</b> awarded the area to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} at <b>Tilsit</b> gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Since the War of the Third Coalition, the French had {{maintained}} client kingdoms in Italy and Naples that controlled the western {{shores of the}} Adriatic. Over the next four years, strategically important islands and territories had been seized in the treaties of <b>Tilsit</b> and Schönbrunn, giving Napoleon direct command of the eastern shore. With these treaties, France had seized not only several important fortress islands, most notably Corfu, but also many important shipyards and harbours. Maintaining control of the Adriatic was however even harder than seizing it had been, the threat of attack by Austrian, Russian or Ottoman armies and the mountainous terrain of the Balkans forcing the development of garrisons that could be effectively resupplied only by sea.|$|E
5|$|The Gediminid dynasty {{began its}} ascent in Lithuania {{during this time}} with the {{emergence}} of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (<b>Tilsit)</b> and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point at which it was poised for expansion.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{garrison}} on Corfu, augmented with {{a powerful}} naval squadron, effectively blocked French use of the Adriatic by sealing the entrance through the Straits of Otranto. French military concerns were also directed further north at this time, resulting in the War of the Fourth Coalition during 1806 and 1807 that saw Napoleon's armies overrun Prussia and force the Russians to sign the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> on July 7, 1807. One of the minor clauses of this treaty transferred the Septinsular Republic back into French hands, the Russians withdrawing completely from the Adriatic. This withdrawal supported a hidden clause in the treaty that guaranteed French support in the continuing Russian war with the Ottomans in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. To protect these gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports {{in an effort to}} rebuild their Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} developed {{following the}} Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> in 1807, {{in which the}} Russian Navy agreed {{to withdraw from the}} Adriatic. For the next seven years, the Royal Navy sought to disrupt French and Italian military and commercial sea traffic, as well as the movement of troops and supplies to the Illyrian Provinces. Command of the Adriatic partially rested on control of the Ionian Islands, which lie outside the Straits of Otranto but could be used to blockade the passage if properly garrisoned. To this end, the French heavily fortified the island of Corfu, but were unable to consistently maintain an effective naval squadron to dispute British operations in the Adriatic. Exploiting French weakness at sea, British cruisers were able to defeat successive French squadrons sent to reinforce the region and exerted total dominance in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1808, Napoleon was ceremonially {{presented}} {{the keys to}} the city at the Brühler-Tor before going to meet Tsar Alexander I on the road to Weimar to re-enter the city with the tsar. Between 27 September and 14 October 1808, Napoleon hosted the Congress of Erfurt in the principality, intended to reaffirm the alliance with the Tsar, which had been concluded the previous year with the Treaties of <b>Tilsit</b> {{at the end of the}} War of the Fourth Coalition. The meeting became a great conference involving an array of kings, princes, dukes, barons and notables from all over Europe, including the kings of Saxony, Bavaria, Württemberg and Westphalia (the last being Napoleon's brother Jérôme). The resulting convention recognised the Russian conquests of Finland from Sweden and the Danubian Principalities from the Ottoman Empire and stated that, should France go to war again with Austria, Russia should , though the tsar's support in the War of the Fifth Coalition was minimal.|$|E
25|$|The embassy of Gardanne to Persia soon {{lost one}} of the main reasons for its {{original}} dispatch. In a final reversal, Napoleon I finally vanquished Russia at the Battle of Friedland in July 1807, and France and Russia became allied at the Treaty of <b>Tilsit.</b> General Gardanne arrived in Tehran in Persia after the Treaty of <b>Tilsit,</b> in December 1807.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's {{overwhelming}} {{victory was}} enough to convince the Russian political establishment that peace was necessary. Friedland effectively ended the War of the Fourth Coalition, as Emperor Alexander I reluctantly entered peace negotiations with Napoleon. These discussions eventually culminated in the Treaties of <b>Tilsit,</b> by which Russia agreed to join the Continental System against Great Britain and by which Prussia lost almost half of its territories. The lands lost by Prussia were converted into the new Kingdom of Westphalia, which was governed by Napoleon's brother, Jérôme. <b>Tilsit</b> also gave France control of the Ionian Islands, a vital and strategic entry point into the Mediterranean Sea. Some historians regard the political settlements at <b>Tilsit</b> as the height of Napoleon's empire {{because there was no}} longer any continental power challenging the French domination of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers, {{the second}} war of Poland is started; the first {{finished}} in <b>Tilsit.</b> In <b>Tilsit,</b> Russia swore eternal alliance in France and war in England. It violates its oaths today. Russia is pulled by its fate; its destinies must be achieved! Does it thus believe us degenerated? Thus {{let us go}} ahead; let us pass Neman River, carry the war on its territory. The second war of Poland will be glorious with the French Armies like the first one.|$|E
25|$|Persia however {{lost the}} main {{motivation}} for the alliance, the recovery of Georgia and Azerbaijan over Russia, which had not even been addressed at the Treaty of <b>Tilsit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Voigt {{was born}} in <b>Tilsit,</b> Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). In 1863, aged 14, {{he was sentenced to}} 14 days in prison for theft, which led to his {{expulsion}} from school. He learned shoemaking from his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} Prussian Eastern Railway {{linked the}} city to Breslau, Thorn, Insterburg, Eydtkuhnen, <b>Tilsit,</b> and Pillau. In 1860 the railway connecting Berlin with St. Petersburg was completed and increased Königsberg's commerce. Extensive electric tramways were in operation by 1900; and regular steamers plied to Memel, Tapiau and Labiau, Cranz, <b>Tilsit,</b> and Danzig. The completion of a canal to Pillau in 1901 increased the trade of Russian grain in Königsberg, but, like much of eastern Germany, the city's economy was generally in decline. By 1900 the city's population had grown to 188,000, with a 9,000-strong military garrison. By 1914 Königsberg had a population of 246,000; Jews flourished in the culturally pluralistic city.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{negotiations}} at <b>Tilsit</b> featured plenty of pageantry and diplomatic niceties, {{they were not}} spared from ruthless politics. Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, {{to make peace with}} Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at <b>Tilsit</b> caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic Era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, <b>Tilsit</b> at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days. His arrival was greeted with huge celebrations in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The Russian fleet {{captured}} {{the islands of}} Curzola and Lissa, while the Austrians were persuaded to surrender Cattaro to them. As {{a result of these}} operations, the French were prevented from taking hold of the Ionian Islands. However, the fruits of Senyavin's activity were thrown away by the tsar who would conclude the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> with Napoleon the following year.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} between France and the Ottoman Empire was maintained, and a peace settlement was brokered between Russia and the Ottomans, but the territories the Ottomans {{had been promised}} (Moldavia and Wallachia) through the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> were never returned, although the Ottomans themselves had complied with their part of the agreement by moving their troops south of the Danube.|$|E
25|$|In 1807 the County of the Mark {{passed from}} Prussia to France in the Treaties of <b>Tilsit.</b> In 1808 Napoleon then gave Mark to the {{elevated}} Grand Duchy of Berg, which {{was divided into}} four departments {{along the lines of}} Napoleonic France. Mark was in the Ruhr Department until the collapse of French power in 1813, when it returned to Prussia.|$|E
25|$|The synagogue is {{composed}} of two buildings: one with a facade overlooking on the quai <b>Tilsit</b> and with a 160 square-meter area, {{and the other with}} a 550 square-meter area separated from the first building by a small 120 square-meter courtyard. The access to the building is by the courtyard, through a porch located below the first building, enclosed by a wrought iron gate.|$|E
25|$|Following Russia's {{declaration}} of war against Great Britain in 1807 following the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> between Napoleon and Alexander I of Russia, the British government issued an embargo against all Russian ships then found in British ports. Surveillante was one of 70 British vessels present at Portsmouth, at the detaining of the 44-gun frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy) and the Wilhelmina (Vilgemina), which were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin’s squadron in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|At {{the meeting}} of 14 January 2008, the City Council awarded a grant of 90,197 euro, which corresponded to 50% of roofing and 50% of repairs to the facade on the rue <b>Tilsit.</b> This {{resolution}} was confirmed by {{the meeting of}} 23 June 2008, which approved the agreement on objectives and resources and defined the respective obligations of the City of Lyon and the Association of Jewish worship {{as well as the}} procedure for granting the subsidy.|$|E
25|$|To secure his own {{domination}} and {{to render the}} rest of Europe virtually powerless, Napoleon established an alliance with Russia by concluding the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> in 1807. Russia undertook to aid Napoleon in his war against Britain; in turn, the Emperor of Russia would receive the Ottoman territories of Moldavia and Wallachia. If the Sultan refused to surrender these territories, France and Russia were to attack the Empire, and the Ottoman domains in Europe were to be partitioned between the two allies.|$|E
25|$|In 1908–1909, {{the society}} resumed the {{tradition}} of organizing concerts and theater performances at various rural locations of Lithuania Minor. For example, it organized an Easter concert in Katyčiai in 1909. Initially it {{enlisted the help of}} a choir from Tauragė, but soon reestablished its own choir (1909–1912), directed by Albert Johann Niemann. However, the events were not as popular or well executed as those of the Lithuanian Choir of <b>Tilsit.</b> Vilniaus žinios in particular harshly criticized the performance of Ponas ir mužikai in 1908.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Russian forces {{also moved}} on Galicia, {{trying to prevent}} the Poles from gaining too much {{strength}} and hoping to take some Austrian-held territories with no intent of returning them after the war. The Russian forces were, in theory, honouring a stipulation in the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> which called for Russia to join France {{in the event of}} an Austrian breach of the peace, but Russian and Austrian forces still considered each other de facto allies. The commander in the theatre, Sergei Golitsyn, had instructions to aid the Polish as little as possible.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{news about}} the Treaty of <b>Tilsit,</b> Senyavin {{was reported to have}} been overcome with tears (12 August). All his conquests had to be forfeited after the international situation had been reversed dramatically: Napoleon was considered Russia's ally and Britain was Russia's foe. On 14 August he and Lord Collingwood reluctantly parted ways. Eight days later, {{a large part of the}} Russian squadron (5 battleships, 4 frigates, 4 corvettes, 4 brigs) was ordered to return to Sevastopol. Senyavin was to lead the remaining fleet to the Baltic, where the Finnish War with Sweden was already brewing.|$|E
25|$|By the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, Corfu was ceded to the French, who {{occupied}} it for {{two years}} as the département of Corcyre, until they were expelled by a joint Russian-Ottoman squadron under Admiral Ushakov. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the Heptanesos ("Seven Islands"), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor François-Xavier Donzelot, and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands.|$|E
25|$|In European policy, Alexander I {{switched}} Russia {{back and}} forth four times in 1804–1812 from neutral peacemaker to anti-Napoleon to an ally of Napoleon, winding up in 1812 as Napoleon's enemy. In 1805, he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon, but after the massive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz he switched and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of <b>Tilsit</b> (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System. He fought a small-scale naval war against Britain, 1807–12. He and Napoleon could never agree, especially about Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945, {{the army}} {{became part of}} the 3rd Belorussian Front, {{fighting}} in the Insterburg–Königsberg Offensive, part of the East Prussian Offensive. Between 20 and 23 January, the division captured <b>Tilsit,</b> Heinrichswalde, and Labiau. The 263rd then fought in the Battle of Königsberg, taking in part in the capture of the city on 9 April. After the fall of the city, the 43rd Army and the division joined the 2nd Belorussian Front in East Prussia. At {{the end of the war}} the 263rd was still with the 43rd Army's 54th Rifle Corps near the German Baltic coast.|$|E
25|$|An {{attack on}} the Empire, however, {{did not come to}} pass, and the {{alliance}} concluded at <b>Tilsit</b> was dissolved by the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Following Napoleon's defeat by the Great Powers in 1815, representatives of the victors met at the Congress of Vienna, but failed to take any action relating to the territorial integrity of the decaying Ottoman Empire. This omission, together with the exclusion of the Sultan from the Holy Alliance, was interpreted by many as supportive of the position that the Eastern Question was a Russian domestic issue that did not concern any other European nations.|$|E
