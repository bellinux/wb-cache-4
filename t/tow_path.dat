5|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in inland waterways {{following the end of}} the Second World War has resulted in the <b>tow</b> <b>path</b> alongside the canal becoming part of the Itchen Way long-distance footpath, and is a popular route for walkers. The Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed in the 1970s, but progress was slow. A joint venture between the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust in 2005 {{led to the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust, and two years later, they obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, funding the creation of the Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, which has sought to conserve and interpret the remains. The route provides habitat for a diverse flora and fauna, which has resulted in it being designated as a European Special Area of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

This survey was undertaken to determine levels of use and attitudes of users to each other; to determine the change in levels of use and user attitudes after opening the <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> to unrestricted cycle use; to establish whether the new facilities encourage new visitors; to establish whether the <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> functions {{as part of a}} wider leisure path network; to obtain users' views on the new facilities. Main Topics : Group size, age, sex; origins, distance travelled, destinations, purpose of visit, frequency of visits; method of transport; use of local footpaths and country roads; how visitors heard of site, attractions of site, attitudes to other users, difficulties in using the <b>towing</b> <b>path.</b> In addition to the interview data, observation data was collected for different types of user for forty minutes per hour between 10 a. m. and 6. 40 p. m. on each survey date for 1 mile stretches of <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> centred on the survey points...|$|R

2500|$|The {{flat-bottomed}} canal boats had blunt bows, square sterns, and a {{draft of}} [...] [...] A <b>tow</b> <b>path</b> adjacent to the excavated portions of the canal enabled horses to tow the canal boats while the boatmen steered with poles. [...] Canal boats using the lakes had a removable keel and two short hinged masts capable of supporting sails or being folded down for passage through the excavated canal. [...] Cargos included lumber, masts, barrel hoops and staves, boxmaking shook, and firewood from the interior to Portland. [...] Apples were an important agricultural product of the area; and Oriental Powder Company mills adjacent to the canal in Windham manufactured nearly 25% of the Union gunpowder supply for the American Civil War. [...] Canal boat passengers were charged one-half cent per mile. [...] A wide variety of manufactured goods moved inland through the canal from Portland. [...] The south end of Long Lake is locally known as Brandy Pond because a barrel of brandy was lost from a canal boat during passage through {{that part of the}} waterway.|$|E
60|$|Before the trekschuyt {{had gone}} far, after it {{commenced}} its voyage, a great ship was seen {{coming on the}} canal. She {{was coming from the}} Helder. It was a ship that had come from the West Indies, and was going to Amsterdam. The wind was contrary for her, and they could not use their sails, and so they were drawing her along by horses. There were two teams of horses, eight in each team. The view of these teams, walking along the <b>tow</b> <b>path,</b> with the immense ship following them in the canal, presented a very imposing spectacle.|$|E
60|$|The ferry boat, by this time, {{began to}} {{approach}} the shore. It entered into a little opening in the land, which formed a sort of harbor. Here the passengers were landed at a wharf, which was surrounded by small buildings. Thence they ascended what was evidently a large dike. When they {{reached the top of}} the dike they saw below them, on the other side of it, the beginning of the canal. It lay several feet lower than the water of the harbor in which they had left the ferry boat; but it was quite wide, and it was bordered by broad dikes with avenues of trees upon them, on either side. On one side, under the trees, was a <b>tow</b> <b>path,</b> and on the other a broad and smoothly gravelled road.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{artificial}} canals, {{most of them were}} constructed with towpaths suitable for horses. Many rivers were improved by artificial cuts, and this often gave an opportunity to construct a <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> at the same time. Even so, the River Don Navigation was improved from Tinsley to Rotherham in 1751, but the horse <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> was not completed on this section until 1822. On the River Avon between Stratford-upon-Avon and Tewkesbury, a towpath was never provided, and bow-hauling continued until the 1860s, when steam tugs were introduced.|$|R
60|$|So he {{concluded}} {{to go at}} once to the boat, according to the arrangement which he had made with the captain. He was afraid {{that he might have}} to wait some time before the captain would see him; but he did not. The captain saw him immediately, and sent a man to row him ashore. Two men came, in fact, the commissioner being one of them. But Rollo did not pay any particular attention to this circumstance. He did not even observe that it was the same man that had come on board with him. Rollo could not talk to the oarsman on the way, but on landing he gave him a little money,--about what he thought was proper,--and then went up into the road with a view to go home. The commissioner, in order not to awaken any suspicions in Rollo's mind that he was following him, turned away as soon as he landed, and walked along the <b>tow</b> <b>path</b> down the stream.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George, all the time, stood {{quietly on}} the deck, {{looking at the}} canal, and at the country around. He could see the canal extending, in a winding direction, across the country; but the view of it was soon lost, as the winding of its course brought the dikes {{on the sides of}} it in the way so that they {{concealed}} the water. He could, however, trace its course for some distance, by the masts and sails of vessels which he saw at different distances rising among the green trees. Along the dike, on one side, was a high road, and on the other, a <b>tow</b> <b>path.</b> Different boats were coming and going in the part of the canal that was near. They were drawn by long and slender lines, that were fastened to a tall mast set up near the bows of the boat. Some were drawn by men, and some by horses.|$|E
60|$|The {{hotels and}} inns, {{even in the}} {{smallest}} villages, are very nice and elegant in all their interior arrangements. These small villages consist usually of a crowded collection of the most quaint and queer-looking houses, or rather huts, of stone, with an antique and venerable-looking church {{in the midst of}} them, looking still more quaint and queer than the houses. The hotels, however, in these villages, or rather on the borders of them,--for the hotels are often built on the open ground beyond the town, where there is room for gardens and walks, and raised terraces around them,--are palaces in comparison with the dwellings of the inhabitants. And well they may be, for the villagers are almost all laborers of a very humble class--boatmen, who get their living by plying boats up and down the river; vinedressers, who cultivate the vineyards of the neighboring hills; or hostlers and coachmen, who take care of the carriages and of the horses employed in the traffic of the river. A great number of horses are employed; for not only are the carriages of such persons as choose to travel on the Rhine by land, or to make excursions {{on the banks of the}} river, drawn by them, but almost all the boats, except the steamboats that go up the river, are towed up by these animals. To enable them to do this, a regular <b>tow</b> <b>path</b> has been formed all the way up the river, on the left bank, and boats of all shapes and sizes are continually to be seen going up, drawn, like canal boats in America, by horses--and sometimes even by men. Once I saw some boys drawing up a small boat in this way. It seems they had been going down the stream to take a sail, or perhaps to convey a traveller down; and now they were coming up again, drawing their boat by walking along the bank, the current being so rapid that it is much easier to draw a boat up than it is to row it. The boys had a long line attached to the mast of their boat, and both of them were drawing upon this line by means of broad bands, forming a sort of harness, which were passed over their shoulders.|$|E
