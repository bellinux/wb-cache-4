5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing global challenges, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> sought {{to improve its}} accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency. In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General. On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> also drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> six {{principal}} organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions {{for peace}} and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the UN Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by Portuguese António Guterres since 2017. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies {{to participate in the}} UN's work.|$|E

5000|$|Although the U.S. {{had first}} opposed itself to colonial empires, the Cold War {{concerns}} about Soviet {{influence in the}} Third World caused it to downplay its advocacy of popular sovereignty and decolonization. France thus had a free hand in the First Indochina War (1946-54) and in the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62). Decolonization itself was a seemingly unstoppable process. In 1960, after a number countries gained independence, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>had</b> reached 99 members states: the decolonization of Africa was almost complete.

25|$|The Sudanese {{government}} {{has been accused of}} suppressing information by jailing and killing witnesses since 2004, and tampering with evidence, such as covering up mass graves. The Sudanese {{government has}} also arrested and harassed journalists, thus limiting the extent of press coverage of the situation in Darfur. While the United States government has described the conflict as genocide, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> not recognized the conflict as such. (see List of declarations of genocide in Darfur).|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income per capita (per person), (gross domestic product) per capita, life expectancy, the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> developed the Human Development Index (HDI), a compound indicator of some above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available.

25|$|Long-term global {{population}} growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011, while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.|$|E

In his maiden speech as President, following his appointment, he had the honour of admitting the Bahamas and both East and West Germany into the United Nations. The admission of the two halves of Germany was an important moment as <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>had</b> been formed as a reaction to World War II which had been initiated by Nazi Germany. This brought the total number of nations in <b>the</b> <b>U.N.</b> to 135 and at the time the prospective candidates were North and South Korea.|$|R

25|$|Current {{human rights}} {{violations}} include the killing of 100 peaceful protestors by direct government gunfire in the Oromo and Amhara regions in 2016. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> called for UN observers {{on the ground in}} Ethiopia to investigate this incident, however the EPRDF-dominated Ethiopian government has refused this call. The protestors are protesting land grabs and lack of basic human rights such as the freedom to elect their representatives. The TPLF-dominated EPRDF won 100% in an election marked by fraud which has resulted in Ethiopian civilians protesting on scale unseen in prior post-election protests.|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2006, the Israeli army {{reported}} that it had completed its withdrawal. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> said Israel has withdrawn the bulk of its troops from Lebanon, fulfilling a key condition of the UN ceasefire ending war with Hezbollah, but that some Israeli troops remained in Ghajar. The IDF confirmed its forces were still operating near Ghajar, a village split in two by the border. Because of the volatile nature of the place, Israel says it will maintain a presence in Ghajar until a security agreement is reached with the UN and the Lebanese army.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the plan}} has gained little {{traction}} among member states. The UN did not require that {{the remainder of the}} funds allocated to the MINUSTAH be repurposed for Cholera reparations, which resulted in many member nations taking back their contributions. As of July 2017, the UN had raised just $9.22 million of the promised $400 million total. Advocates have voiced their displeasure with these results, and the public outcry has grown more forceful as of late; <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> announced the MINUSTAH mission will be ending in October 2017, and many are calling for the new approach to be funded {{by the time of the}} mission's departure.|$|E

25|$|Specialized {{agencies}} are autonomous organizations {{working with the}} United Nations and {{each other through the}} coordinating machinery of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at the intergovernmental level, and through the Chief Executives Board for coordination (CEB) at the inter-secretariat level. Specialized agencies {{may or may not have}} been originally created by the United Nations, but they are incorporated into the United Nations System by the United Nations Economic and Social Council acting under Articles 57 and 63 of the United Nations Charter. At present <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> in total 15 specialized agencies that carry out various functions on behalf of the UN. The specialized {{agencies are}} listed below.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> played various roles {{during the}} {{conflict}} and peace process: a military role through its observer mission (UNOMIG); dual diplomatic roles through the Security Council and {{the appointment of a}} Special Envoy, succeeded by a Special Representative to the Secretary-General; a humanitarian role (UNHCR and UNOCHA); a development role (UNDP); a human rights role (UNHCHR); and a low-key capacity and confidence-building role (UNV). The UN’s position has been {{that there will be no}} forcible change in international borders. Any settlement must be freely negotiated and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multiethnic population has returned. According to Western interpretations the intervention did not contravene international law since Georgia, as a sovereign state, had the right to secure order on its territory and protect its territorial integrity.|$|E
25|$|October 2010 – presently, Haiti and Dominican Republic: Late in October 2010, an {{outbreak}} {{was reported in}} Haiti. As of November 16, the Haitian Health Ministry reported the number of dead to be 1,034, with hospitalizations for cholera symptoms totaling over 16,700. The outbreak was blamed on a camp of Nepalese United Nations peacekeepers, this was disputed then acknowledged by the United Nations. The outbreak started on the upper Artibonite River; people first contracted the disease from this river. In addition, some scientists think the hurricane and weather conditions in Haiti worsened {{the consequences of the}} outbreak, and damaged sanitation systems allowed it to spread. By November 2010, the disease had spread into the neighboring Dominican Republic. As of August 2016, the epidemic has officially sickened at least 790000 people and killed more than 9,000 in Haiti, but the real burden is probably much higher. In the neighboring Dominican Republic, there have been at least 32,000 suspected cases and 500 related deaths. In Haiti, the outbreak was worsened by Hurricane Matthew, which hit the southern portion of Haiti in fall 2016. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>has</b> acknowledged its role in the epidemic. In August 2016, the UN pledged to fight the disease and provide assistance for victims through a $400 million fund; But, as of April 2017, member states had contributed a meagre $10 million of the $400 million pledged.|$|E
