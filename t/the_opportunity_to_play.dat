The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, {{the head of the}} company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers to have <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the part.

5|$|When Georgian {{football}} formed leagues {{independent of}} Soviet competition in 1989, {{a family friend}} arranged for Kinkladze to move to Mretebi Tbilisi, the first openly professional club in the Soviet Union.

Kinkladze made his professional debut aged 16, and immediately became a first team regular. In 1991 Kinkladze's Mretebi won the Pirveli Liga, and won promotion to the highest division following a play-off.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} novella, Mansfield was {{intrigued}} by <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a dual role. He secured the right to adapt the story for the stage in the United States and the United Kingdom, and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted in Boston in May 1887, and a revised version opened on Broadway in September of that year. Critics acclaimed Mansfield's performance as the dual character. The play was popular in New York and on tour, and Mansfield was invited {{to bring it to}} London. It opened there in August 1888, just before the first Jack the Ripper murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Despite significant press coverage, the London production was a financial failure. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play on tours of the U.S. until shortly before his death in 1907.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not have had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Bb4+, a move whose advisability {{depends on}} White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White {{is forced to}} take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates {{the loss of the}} bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the recurring role.|$|E
