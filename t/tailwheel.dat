5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial <b>tailwheel</b> undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the <b>tailwheel</b> opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tailwheel</b> {{configuration}} {{offers several}} advantages over the {{tricycle landing gear}} arrangement, which make <b>tailwheel</b> aircraft less expensive to manufacture and maintain.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydraulically}} operated main-wheel units {{were similar to}} those of the Lancaster, had single Dunlop wheels and retracted rearward into the inboard engine nacelles. The twin <b>tailwheels</b> retracted rearward into the fuselage and were enclosed by twin longitudinal doors.|$|R
25|$|The biplane G-ABKW flew {{first on}} 10 June 1932 and the {{monoplane}} G-ABKV on 4 October 1932. The biplane {{turned out to}} be heavy to fly and with unreliable brakes making taxying difficult. <b>Tailwheels</b> were quite new at the time and the aircraft was troubled by shimmy. The monoplane posed fewer problems.|$|R
50|$|Lala-1 - A {{research}} prototype with an open-frame rear fuselage, twin {{tail and}} twin <b>tailwheels</b> supported by struts under {{the rear of}} the fuselage pod. An Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engine was fitted in {{the rear of the}} fuselage pod for use as a development model for the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor agricultural aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The {{alternative}} is the wheel landing. This requires the pilot {{to land the}} aircraft on the main wheels while maintaining the <b>tailwheel</b> {{in the air with}} elevator to keep the angle of attack low. Once the aircraft has slowed to a speed that can ensure control will not be lost, but above the speed at which rudder effectiveness is lost, then the <b>tailwheel</b> is lowered to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} designed was a cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed <b>tailwheel,</b> {{powered by}} the de Havilland Gipsy Major 1D inline engine.|$|E
50|$|A tailstrike is {{physically}} possible only on an aircraft with tricycle landing gear; with a taildragger configuration, the tail {{is already on}} the ground. Some aircraft which require a high angle of attack on takeoff are fitted with small <b>tailwheels</b> (Concorde and the Saab Draken) or tailskids (Diamond DA20) {{to mitigate the effect}} of tailstrikes.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} cross-section fuselage was an all-metal semi-monocoque structure, of 10 ft diameter, fitted with kapok-filled {{inner and outer}} skins above floor level.The hydraulically operated main-wheel units {{were similar to those}} of the Lancaster, had single Dunlop wheels and retracted rearward into the inboard engine nacelles. The twin <b>tailwheels</b> retracted rearward into the fuselage and were enclosed by twin longitudinal doors.|$|R
5000|$|Belford D. Maule (1911-1995) {{designed}} {{his first}} aircraft, the M-1 starting at age 19. He founded the company Mechanical Products Co. in Jackson, Michigan to market his own starter design. In 1941 the B.D. Maule Co. was founded, and Maule produced <b>tailwheels</b> and fabric testers. In 1953 he began design work, and started aircraft production with the [...] "Bee-Dee" [...] M-4 in 1957.|$|R
25|$|The Tudor was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with four}} engines, a single fin and rudder and a retractable <b>tailwheel</b> undercarriage (in its original configurations).|$|E
25|$|The CG-4A was {{constructed}} of fabric-covered {{wood and metal}} and was crewed by a pilot and copilot. It had two fixed mainwheels and a <b>tailwheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{development}} of the MH.52 was the sole MH.53 Cadet which had a fixed <b>tailwheel</b> landing gear and a lower powered 135hp (101kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major 10 engine.|$|E
50|$|Production Yak-11s were {{heavier than}} the prototypes, with later batches fitted with non-retractable <b>tailwheels</b> and revised propellers. A 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun was {{sometimes}} fitted instead of the UBS, while some were fitted with rear-view periscopes above the windscreen. In total, Soviet production amounted to 3,859 aircraft between 1947 and 1955. with a further 707 licence-built by Let in Czechoslovakia as the C-11.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to various}} long {{distance}} trips {{undertaken by the}} aircraft to participate in airshows and events, the engines are more modern {{than those in the}} original aircraft types. The original wooden tailskids have been replaced with <b>tailwheels</b> in order to operate from paved runways, and the main wheels have been equipped with modern disc brakes. In addition, modern radio equipment and flight instruments have been installed in each aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{working under}} Grigorovich and Polikarpov, {{as well as}} at the TsKB (Central Construction Bureau) and OKB-30, Nikitin {{designed}} and built aircraft that carried his name despite not having an OKB. Inspired by racing aircraft in the USA, Nikitin designed and built the NV-1 <b>tailwheeled</b> monoplane sporting aircraft. The wooden wing was braced to the fuselage and fixed spatted main undercarriage with streamlined steel struts. The fuselage was built up with welded steel tubing and a duralumin tail unit, all covered with fabric.The flying controls were operated by push-pull rods throughout.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{fuselage}} the empennage was steel framed and fabric covered. The tailplanes were mounted just below the top of the fuselage, each braced from below with a single strut and carrying a balanced elevator. A curved, deep, balanced rudder, mounted on a small fin and slightly pointed on top, worked in elevator cut-outs. The airliner had a fixed <b>tailwheel</b> undercarriage. The two mainwheels were mounted independently on V-struts from the lower fuselage with near-vertical oleo struts to the wing roots. The mainwheels had brakes and the <b>tailwheel</b> was steerable.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{increased}} propeller clearance on <b>tailwheel</b> aircraft less stone chip damage will result from operating a conventional geared aircraft on rough or gravel airstrips, making them well-suited to bush flying.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>tailwheel</b> fails on landing, {{the damage}} to the {{aircraft}} will be minimal. This is not the case {{in the event of a}} nosewheel failure, which usually results in a prop strike.|$|E
25|$|As designed, the R.II {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Power was to be supplied by three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of <b>tailwheels.</b> The fueslage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{date and}} time for the raid was settled on October 30 {{for the next day}} at 11:30 a.m. As a final preparation, the {{aircraft}} and crews involved in the raid gathered at the airbase at Swanton Morley at 8:00 a.m. {{on the day of the}} attack for a final briefing. When the fighter planes from 315 (Polish) Squadron landed, it was discovered that four of them had broken <b>tailwheels,</b> so it was decided to proceed with just the remaining eight. At 8:40 a.m., take off began in pairs, and at 9:20 a.m., all 33 were in the air.|$|R
5000|$|Version {{with longer}} nose and radome {{moved to the}} ventral {{position}}. Lookout position in tail. Dorsal turret and two more 20 mm cannons in nose. Twin retractable <b>tailwheels.</b> One aircraft, WB833, originally ordered as a MR 1 was built as a MR 2 prototype and first flew on 17 June 1952 [...] The last ten MR.1s on the production line were completed as MR.2s and orders for 80 new-build aircraft were placed; the last 21 were completed as MR.3s and {{the total number of}} MR.2s built was 69. The first aircraft entered service with 42 Squadron at RAF St Eval in January 1953.|$|R
25|$|Because {{of the way}} {{airframe}} loads {{are distributed}} while operating on rough ground, <b>tailwheel</b> aircraft {{are better able to}} sustain this type of use {{over a long period of}} time, without cumulative airframe damage occurring.|$|E
25|$|Single-seat fighter aircraft, {{equipped}} with folding wings, a retractable <b>tailwheel,</b> self-sealing fuel tanks, {{a very small}} dorsal fin, powered by a 2,100hp (1,566kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-34W Double Wasp radial piston engine, armed with four 0.50in (12.7mm) machine guns, 658 built.|$|E
25|$|A naval {{version with}} <b>tailwheel</b> landing gear, the XFL-1 Airabonita, was ordered as a {{competitor}} to the Vought F4U Corsair and Grumman XF5F Skyrocket. It first flew 13 May 1940, {{but after a}} troublesome and protracted development and testing period, it was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|The R.I {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Power was supplied by three 112-kW (150-hp) Benz Bz.III engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of <b>tailwheels.</b> The rear fuselage structure [...] was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft. The entire structure was of wire-braced wood, covered in fabric.|$|R
5|$|The RLM {{considered}} {{setting up}} production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until {{the buildings and}} factories could be furnished with the machine tools. These tools were also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would only produce another 25 machines per month {{at a time when}} demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt another blow when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of <b>tailwheels</b> and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{generally}} high thrust line (aft propeller/ ground clearance), a low wing pusher layout may suffer pitch changes with power variation (pitch/power coupling). Pusher seaplanes with especially high thrust lines and <b>tailwheels</b> {{may find the}} vertical tail masked from the airflow, severely reducing control at low speeds, such as when taxiing.The absence of prop-wash over the wing reduces the lift and increases takeoff roll length.Pusher engines mounted on the wing may obstruct sections of the wing trailing edge, reducing the total width available for control surfaces such as flaps and ailerons.When a propeller is mounted {{in front of the}} tail, changes in engine power alter the airflow over the tail and can give strong pitch or yaw changes.|$|R
