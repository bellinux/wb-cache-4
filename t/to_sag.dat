40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} {{that result in}} end-stage organ damage cause inflammation, which can reveal sequestered self-antigens (SAgs) in that organ and trigger autoimmunity. The thymus gland deletes self-reactive T-cells against ubiquitously expressed SAgs, while regulatory mechanisms in the periphery control immune responses <b>to</b> tissue-restricted <b>SAgs.</b> It is now established that T-cells reactive <b>to</b> <b>SAgs</b> present in certain organs (e. g., lungs, pancreas, and intestine) are incompletely eliminated, and the dysregulation of peripheral immuneregulation can generate immune responses <b>to</b> <b>SAgs.</b> Therefore, chronic diseases can activate self-reactive lymphocytes, inducing tissue-restricted autoimmunity. During organ transplantation, donor lymphocytes are tested against recipient serum (i. e., cross-matching) to detect antibodies (Abs) against donor human leukocyte antigens, which {{has been shown to}} reduce Ab-mediated hyperacute rejection. However, primary allograft dysfunction and rejection still occur frequently. Because donor lymphocytes do not express tissue-restricted SAgs, preexisting Abs against SAgs are undetectable during conventional cross-matching. Preexisting and de novo immune responses <b>to</b> tissue-restricted <b>SAgs</b> (i. e., autoimmunity) {{play a major role in}} rejection. In this review, we discuss the evidence that supports autoimmunity as a contributor to rejection. Testing for preexisting and de novo immune responses <b>to</b> tissue-restricted <b>SAgs</b> and treatment based on immune responses after organ transplantation may improve short- and long-term outcomes after transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{codes and}} {{standards}} such as the (Eurocode 4, 2004) deal with the characterisation of steel–concrete composite joints in building structures, mainly under hogging bending moments in the beam. However, in sway composite frames or when the composite structure is subjected to an accidental/exceptional event such as earthquake or column loss, the beam-to-column joint may be subjected <b>to</b> <b>sagging</b> bending moment, a loading situation which is not yet covered by the codes. This paper deals with the behaviour of composite beam-to-column external joints under sagging bending moments, mainly focusing on the specific joint component “concrete slab in compression”. Indeed, if reference is made to Eurocodes, the method recommended to characterise structural joints is the component method and the “concrete slab in compression” component {{has been identified as}} the missing component to be able to apply this method to composite joints subjected <b>to</b> <b>sagging</b> bending moment. In this article, the finite element method is used to model the slab using VecTor 2 software. Through the performed numerical simulations, the behaviour of the slab is studied in detail and an analytical model is proposed. With the proposed model, it is possible to characterise the concrete slab in compression component and so, to apply the component method to predict the mechanical properties of composite joints subjected <b>to</b> <b>sagging</b> bending moment.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of modelling sags with discrete fault-clearing instants on the behaviour of adjustablespeed drives (ASDs) subjected <b>to</b> <b>sags</b> caused by faults. The effects are {{compared with those of}} sags modelled with simultaneous fault clearance in all faulted phases (i. e. abrupt fault clearance; the most common approach <b>to</b> voltage <b>sag</b> modelling). In many cases, abrupt fault clearance is far more severe than discrete fault clearance. Thus, if an ASD rides through a more severe case of an abrupt fault clearance test, it will likely ride through a discrete fault clearance sag. As current protocols for testing the immunity of ASDs <b>to</b> voltage <b>sags</b> only consider abrupt fault clearance, {{it is not necessary to}} consider the more complicated discrete fault clearance in equipment sag-testing methodology if more severe abrupt clearance sags are properly chosen and tested.

25|$|Platformers {{remained}} a vital genre, {{but they never}} recaptured the popularity they once held. In 1998, platform games had a 15% share of the market, and even higher during their heyday, but only four years later that figure had dropped to 2%. Even the much acclaimed Psychonauts experienced modest sales at first, leading publisher Majesco Entertainment to withdraw from high budget console games, even though its sales in Europe were respectable, and franchises like Tomb Raider began <b>to</b> <b>sag.</b> Other forms of third-person action games have cut into the sales of platformers, while genres such as RPGs and first-person shooters have continued to grow in popularity.

25|$|The light {{construction}} and hollow {{nature of the}} structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but {{the contents of the}} buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half. It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been {{standing in the way of}} the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely. The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors <b>to</b> <b>sag,</b> pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.|$|E
25|$|After {{the planes}} struck the {{buildings}}, {{but before the}} buildings collapsed, the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections. Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel. As a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining plastic and creep deformation from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by {{the heat of the}} fires, and as the floors began <b>to</b> <b>sag</b> they pulled the exterior walls inwards. In the case of 2 WTC, this caused the eastern face to buckle, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse. In the case of 1 WTC, the south wall later buckled in the same way, and with similar consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look {{as if it had been}} standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared <b>to</b> <b>sag.</b> The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E
