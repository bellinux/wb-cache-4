5|$|The {{only time}} the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short time after <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> branch north of Fort Totten {{opened in the}} early 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was completed.|$|E
5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> near Berwyn Heights, Maryland {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} Lake Artemesia. In 1976, WMATA removed sand and gravel needed for construction from open space adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> In exchange, WMATA paid to develop the area as a lake surrounded by a park.|$|E

5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds to complete <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line,</b> forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation {{had created a}} $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> be sped up.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} {{two steps}} to secure completion of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee {{negotiations with the}} various entities involved with the siting of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched {{back to the original}} route.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> {{is one of}} the six heavy rail subway {{lines that}} make up the Washington Metro rapid transit system in the Washington, D.C., {{metropolitan}} area. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> consists of 21 stations, with termini at Branch Avenue and at Greenbelt. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> runs through Prince George's County, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. It was the last line in the original Metrorail plan to be constructed, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington. It shares nine stations with the Yellow Line, one station with the Blue, Silver and Orange lines, and two stations with the Red Line.|$|E

5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E

5|$|Just {{four days}} later, Metro, D.C. and Prince George's County officials, and advocates {{of both the}} Branch Avenue and Rosecroft routes reached an {{agreement}} to begin construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia, pending resolution of the line's final route by December 6, 1984. The agreement called for construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> to Waterfront Station in the summer, siting of the tunnel under the Anacostia River by June 28, and the holding of public hearings on the remaining route between July 18 and August 3. The U.S. federal district court approved the agreement on March 7. Following the ruling, Metro {{announced that it would}} build the Anacostia Station on Howard Road between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Freeway, as well as a new Metro station at the Washington Navy Yard, and would open <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> by 1990. Metro asked and won approval from the court to build the Navy Yard and Anacostia stations and the tunnel in June 1984.|$|E
5|$|The District of Columbia {{government}} {{responded by}} threatening to veto any further Metro subway construction unless construction of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was made Metro's highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes. Construction began on the Waterfront Station, and the station was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated {{the cost of building}} <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia opened as {{scheduled}} on December 28, 1991. Ridership expanded rapidly on <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> In the first workweek of the year, more than 8,000 riders a day boarded {{at the three}} stations in Southeast D.C. (more than 5,000 of them at Anacostia), exceeding WMATA's estimates, and nearly 10,000 riders were boarding each day at the three stations by {{the third week of}} January.|$|E

5|$|The first WMATA budget which {{contained}} funds for operating <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed in December 1989. The budget presumed a December 1, 1990, opening for the Mt. Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations, and requested funds {{to test the}} soon-to-open Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station. The budget also projected that <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station would open in 1991, and that new Metrobus service will be added in Prince George's County to bring commuters to the new station.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> is {{near the}} intersection of Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) and Auth Road just inside the Capital Beltway near Andrews Air Force Base. The route goes northwest through a park to join {{the right of way}} of the Suitland Parkway. It veers southeast along Southern Avenue and then north on 13th Street SE to rejoin Suitland Parkway. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> crosses the Anacostia River and tunnels under the Washington Navy Yard and travels west under M Street SE. It then joins the Yellow Line in a tunnel under 7th Street SW. The tunnel bends west along Florida Avenue and U Street NW and then turns north under 14th Street NW. The tunnel turns northeast under New Hampshire Ave NW, and cut across Fort Totten Park where it intersects the Red Line. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> runs east through the Fort Circle Parks and tunnels under Queens Chapel Road to emerge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad right of way to Greenbelt adjacent to the Capital Beltway.|$|E
