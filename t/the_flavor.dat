5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others have described <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve <b>the</b> <b>flavor.</b> One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as {{there have been}} poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At times, Beecher's has {{encountered}} challenges in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, the cows there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves {{to fight off}} bacteria, but changed <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of the milk.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better <b>the</b> <b>flavor.</b> For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
30|$|The {{sweet and}} salty flavor was {{compared}} with the original non-flavor to understand if Chinese consumers prefer original pistachio to <b>the</b> <b>flavored</b> alternatives. <b>The</b> original <b>flavor</b> is significantly preferred to <b>the</b> sweet <b>flavor,</b> {{as suggested by the}} negative coefficient of <b>the</b> Sweet <b>Flavor</b> variable. Though <b>the</b> salty <b>flavor</b> is not significantly preferred to <b>the</b> original <b>flavor,</b> both salty- and original- flavored are more attractive than <b>the</b> sweet <b>flavored</b> pistachios.|$|R

Also sold is Mentos KIDZ, a bag with 12 boxes containing 10 miniature candies, in <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> strawberry, orange, lemon, apple and blueberry.|$|R
5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used {{in order to prevent}} the mechanical breakdown of the product and to preserve <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> as far as is possible. The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, cubeb {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} spices during the Middle Ages. It was ground as a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes cubeb in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several spices. As an aromatic confectionery, cubeb was often candied and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with cubeb, cumin and garlic, was used for meat marinades in Poland during the 14th century. Cubeb can still be used to enhance <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of savory soups.|$|E
5|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} is edible, and {{is collected}} {{for sale in}} Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The taste is described as mild, and the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist David Arora claims <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> to be inferior to Craterellus. Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.|$|E

50|$|Large-scale {{manufacturers}} have also started using <b>the</b> <b>flavoring</b> in their products. Calbee makes snack {{foods such as}} potato chips that are flavored as yuzukoshō, but they are found in only certain locations. Ezaki Glico makes PRETZ with <b>the</b> <b>flavoring,</b> and Meiji makes a curly corn chip that is sold only in Kyushu. Kameda makes fried mochi chips and senbei as well. However, as snacks must not have any moisture in them, <b>the</b> <b>flavoring</b> is created by combining yuzu powder and chili powder, and real yuzukoshō is not used. In Kyushu, Kit Kats with yuzukoshō flavor are sold.|$|R
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} grilled, {{but they can}} be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled in an attempt to {{replicate}} <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). <b>The</b> <b>flavor</b> of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E

5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is to add to <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of the cake changing, and a painting {{given to him by}} Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E
5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E

5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not <b>the</b> <b>flavor</b> of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
