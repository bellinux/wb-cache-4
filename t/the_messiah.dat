5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E

Among other {{recurring}} characters are Hiroko, a rebellious temple knight; Beth, {{a woman from}} the center who vows to always stay by Hawk's side; Daleth, who claims to be <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> and fights Hawk multiple times; Zayin, a temple knight; and Gimmel, {{a man from the}} Arcadia forest, who knows Hawk from somewhere.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Jewish history Jews have {{compared}} these passages (and others) to contemporary events {{in search of}} signs of <b>the</b> <b>Messiah's</b> imminent arrival, continuing into present times.

If a {{champion}} was pinned by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning Flash to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's Deja Vu, Flash and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held. Due to the double pinfall, Flash won the Iron Man Championship, while Pain retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} comprises first-person {{exploration of}} dungeons and battles against demons; the player can also choose {{to speak to}} the demons, and attempt to recruit them to their party. By fusing multiple allied demons together, the player can create more powerful demons. The story is set decades after the first Shin Megami Tensei, in the encapsulated city Tokyo Millennium, which is ruled by the religious Messians from a unit called the Center. The player takes the role of a gladiator who is told that he is <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> and is sent on missions around Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare for the Thousand-Year Kingdom. The plot is influenced by choices the player makes throughout the game, determining their moral alignment.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} demon Nadja, Aleph travels through the underground, finding a brainwashed Hiroko in a {{concentration}} camp. Her cell is guarded by Zayin, who admits to having {{doubts about the}} Center's action and lets Aleph free Hiroko; she refuses to leave, but Nadja frees her from the brainwashing by fusing with her. On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be allowed {{to live in the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone else would be abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens to cut off the air supply to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to wait any longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Early English composers in {{classical}} music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel became a British subject and {{spent most of}} his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, <b>The</b> <b>Messiah,</b> Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest, composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The gospel Epiphanius {{attributed}} to the Ebionites is a valuable source of information that provides modern scholars with insights into the distinctive characteristics of a vanished branch of Jewish Christianity. However, scholars disagree on whether the information contained within the seven fragments preserved by Epiphanius accurately reflects {{the traditions of the}} second-century Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus, or if their belief system changed, perhaps greatly, over a span of 200 years compared to this early group. The Ebionites known to Irenaeus (first mentioned in Adversus Haereses 1.26.2, written around 185) and other Church Fathers prior to Epiphanius were described as a Jewish sect that regarded Jesus as <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> but not as divine. They insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites and they used only the Jewish–Christian gospel. The Ebionites rejected the epistles of Paul of Tarsus, whom they regarded as an apostate from the Law.|$|E
50|$|His {{followers}} {{would teach}} {{of his previous}} identification with Jeremiah, and how this affected his present life. In his later days he yearned {{so much for the}} coming of <b>the</b> Jewish <b>Messiah</b> and <b>the</b> rebuilding of the Temple, that he wore his Shabbat clothing the entire week, anticipating <b>the</b> <b>Messiah's</b> arrival. He died on July 17, 1841.|$|R

25|$|Throughout Hasidic history, {{there have}} also been {{numerous}} cases of Rebbes that have been identified by their Hasidim as worthy of being <b>the</b> <b>Messiah.</b> These figures were not thought of having been the actual Messiah, since the criteria that must be fulfilled by <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> have been clearly stipulated by Maimonodes. Followers hoped that it would be their leader who would be <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> and occasionally spoke of him as <b>the</b> <b>Messiah.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} The Rebbe, <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference (2008) {{reported}} the belief disconfirmation occurred to the Chabad Orthodox Jewish congregation {{who believed that}} their Rebbe (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was <b>the</b> <b>Messiah.</b> Yet, when {{he died of a}} stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact, and chose to continue believing that Schneerson was <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> and soon would return from the dead.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} his admirers hoped {{that he would}} be {{revealed}} as <b>the</b> <b>Messiah.</b> Admirers pointed to traditional Jewish theology which teaches that in every generation there is one person who is worthy of being <b>the</b> <b>Messiah,</b> and if God deems the times right, he will be revealed by God as such. Chabad followers also pointed to a tradition that in every generation there is one person who is considered <b>the</b> <b>Messiah</b> of the generation.|$|E

25|$|Schneerson {{was criticized}} for his passion and desire to raise {{awareness}} of the coming of <b>the</b> <b>Messiah.</b> Detractors criticized a children's song with the words “We want moshiach (<b>the</b> <b>messiah)</b> now / We don't want to wait,” that Schneerson commended.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} Christ in Christianity {{originated}} from the concept of <b>the</b> <b>messiah</b> in Judaism.

It is not a magical book; Shimoda explains that one can do this with any sort of text. <b>The</b> <b>Messiah's</b> Handbook was released as its own title by Hampton Roads Publishing Company.
