The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of the fax software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business had also improved, as the firm's cost of sales was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's gross profits.|$|E

Summary The Australian Government {{has asked the}} Commission to undertake a study into <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business in <b>the</b> dairy product manufacturing industry. (In the same terms of reference, the Commission has also been asked to undertake a study into <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business in <b>the</b> retail trade industry, and a separate issues paper has been prepared for that study.) In relation to the dairy product manufacturing industry, the Commission has been asked to: 	undertake a case study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> structures <b>of</b> businesses operating in the Australian dairy product manufacturing industry 	where relevant, identify areas <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> advantage and disadvantage for these businesses compared to international competitors.

25|$|The Sleaford Navigation, which canalised a 12.5 mile {{stretch the}} River Slea, opened in 1794. It {{facilitated}} {{the export of}} agricultural produce to the midlands and the import of coal and oil. Mills sprang up along the river's course and the Navigation Company's wharves were built near its office on Carre Street. In 1827, the River Witham Navigation committee investigated {{the possibility of a}} railway allowing Ancaster stone to be transported to the Sleaford Navigation. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so and competition from other quarries meant that their plans came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|Talent {{did take}} a {{position}} on the ballot-initiative in Missouri, called Proposition B, that would raise the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 per hour, or {{to the level of the}} federal minimum wage if that is higher, with subsequent adjustments for inflation. He said he believed it was a state issue, but stated he supports minimum wage increases if they are coupled with tax breaks for small businesses.

25|$|By comparison, {{the most}} {{efficient}} randomized primality test for general integers, the Miller–Rabin primality test, requires O(k n2 log n log log n) bit operations using FFT multiplication for an n-digit number, where k {{is the number of}} iterations and is related to the error rate. For constant k, this is in the same complexity class as the Lucas-Lehmer test. In practice however, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> many iterations and other differences leads to worse performance for Miller–Rabin. The most efficient deterministic primality test for any n-digit number, the AKS primality test, requires Õ(n6) bit operations in its best known variant and is dramatically slower in practice.|$|E
25|$|Coordination {{games have}} been studied in {{laboratory}} experiments. One such experiment by Bortolotti, Devetag, and Ortmann was a weak-link experiment in which groups of individuals were asked to count and sort coins {{in an effort to}} measure the difference between individual and group incentives. Players in this experiment received a payoff based on their individual performance as well as a bonus that was weighted by the number of errors accumulated by their worst performing team member. Players also had the option to purchase more time, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so was subtracted from their payoff. While groups initially failed to coordinate, researchers observed about 80% of the groups in the experiment coordinated successfully when the game was repeated.|$|E
25|$|The island remains privately owned, and Turtle Island {{only has}} {{remnants}} of structures still standing. In February 2002, {{the owner of}} the island attempted to build three new buildings on the island with the reported intent of using them for summer vacation rentals. Authorities in Monroe County issued a decree to stop the construction, because the owner failed to get the building permits to build on the Michigan side of the island. The decree was ignored, but the structures were never completely finished before they were mostly destroyed by large ice packs during the winter of 2009. Erie Township, which has jurisdiction over the Michigan half of Turtle Island, has planned to remove the now-destroyed structures from the island and clean up the remaining debris. This action has not taken place yet, because <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so would be too expensive. The township has continually debated on {{what to do with the}} island.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> classical molecular dynamics (MM) {{in the most}} straightforward case scales O(n2), where n {{is the number of}} atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n2). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ab initio calculations typically scale O(n3) or worse (restricted Hartree–Fock calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n2.7)). To overcome the limit, {{a small part of the}} system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.|$|E
500|$|In the UK, the House of Lords has {{considered}} {{the relevance of}} the availability of financial resources to a public authority's decision. In R. v.

For instance, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that [...] "needs for services cannot sensibly be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providing them.

500|$|The {{agreement}} {{was not enough}} to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. [...] The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian dollar, led the Winnipeg Jets to relocate to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996, becoming the Coyotes one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver, Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche. Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada, and citing <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars, the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in 1996. [...] The Hartford Whalers became the third former World Hockey Association team to relocate in 1997, moving to Raleigh, North Carolina, to become the Carolina Hurricanes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> inter- and intra-regional {{diversification}} {{have been}} widely discussed in the existing international business literature, but the findings are mixed. Explanations for the mixed findings have important managerial implications, because business managers have to estimate accurately <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business within and across regions before they make their internationalization decisions. To explain the existing mixed findings, this study differentiates between liabilities of foreignness at the country and regional levels, and explores the joint effects of liability of country foreignness (LCF) and liability of regional foreignness (LRF) {{on the performance of}} internationalizing firms. Using data from 167 Canadian firms, we find that LCF may not necessarily be negatively correlated with intra-regional diversification, but LRF is positively correlated with inter-regional diversification. LCF moderates the relationship between LRF and inter-regional diversification, and also mediates the relationship between intra-regional diversification and firm performance. LRF mediates the relationship between inter-regional diversification and firm performance. Missing {{one or more of these}} variables may result in different <b>cost</b> estimates. Identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships between these variables helps to improve the accuracy <b>of</b> estimating <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business aboard...|$|R
40|$|Decisions by {{institutional}} review boards (IRBs) are pre-sumed {{to reflect the}} norms and standards of the scientific community.
