The purity of cathode materials is crucial for <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The Ba content significantly increases on the surface layers of oxide cathodes down to several tens of nanometers in depth, after the cathode activation process.

We observe that a 7835 power amplifier vacuum tube has historically provided about one and one-third years service in the Linac.

Taking into account the expected <b>tube</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> the statistical fluctuations on this number, and the amount of time it takes for the manufacturer to make good tubes, we require about 14 tubes either operating, ready as good spares or being manufactured, in order to have sufficient spares to run the Linac.

50|$|Mercury vapors {{are used}} for {{applications}} with high current, e.g. lights, mercury-arc valves, ignitrons. Mercury is used because of its high vapor pressure and low ionization potential. Mercury mixed with an inert gas is used where the energy losses in the tube have to be low and the <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime</b> should be long. In mercury-inert gas mixtures, the discharge is initially carried primarily by the inert gas; the released heat then serves to evaporate enough mercury to reach the desired vapor pressure. Low-voltage (hundreds volts) rectifiers use saturated mercury vapor in combination {{with a small amount}} of inert gas, allowing cold start of the tubes. High-voltage (kilovolts and more) rectifiers use pure mercury vapor at low pressure, requiring maintenance of maximum temperature of the tube. The liquid mercury serves as a reservoir of mercury, replenishing the vapors that are used up during the discharge. Unsaturated mercury vapor can be used, but as it can not be replenished, the lifetime of such tubes is lower. The strong dependence of vapor pressure on mercury temperature limits the environments the mercury-based tubes can operate in. In low-pressure mercury lamps, there is an optimum mercury pressure for the highest efficiency. Photons emitted by ionized mercury atoms can be absorbed by nearby nonionized atoms and either reradiated or the atom is deexcited nonradiatively, too high mercury pressure therefore causes losses of light. Too low mercury pressure leads to too few atoms present to get ionized and radiate photons. The optimum temperature for low-pressure mercury lamps is at about 42 °C, when the saturated vapor pressure of mercury (present as a drop of about 1 mg of liquid mercury in the tube, as a reservoir compensating for losses by clean-up) reaches this optimum. In lamps intended for operation at higher ambient temperatures, and at a wider temperature range, mercury is present in the form of an amalgam with e.g. bismuth and indium; the vapor pressure above amalgam is lower than above liquid mercury. Mercury is used in fluorescent tubes as a source of visible and ultraviolet light for exciting the phosphor; in that application it is usually used together with argon, or in some cases with krypton or neon. Mercury ions deionize slowly, limiting the switching speed of mercury-filled thyratrons. Ion bombardment with mercury ions of even relatively low energies also gradually destroys oxide-coated cathodes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - Worldwide, {{advanced}} {{coal-fired power}} generation systems are being introduced that offer significant {{economic and environmental}} advantages over pulverised fuel (pf) firing. Many of these systems are combined cycles based on fluidised bed combustion and/or gasifica-tion.

40|$|The {{temperature}} distribution on solar trough absorber tubes determines thermal losses and hotspots {{can lead to}} material stress and limit absorber <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The concentrated solar radiation, however, {{makes it difficult to}} determine the temperature on solar absorbers. Temperature sensors that require contact to the measurement object are not appropriate and even pyrometry fails, when external light sources interfere. Only solar-blind pyrometry offers reliable temperature readings without perturbation through reflected solar radiation. This paper presents two concepts for a pyrometric solar-blind measurement on solar trough absorber tubes. One solar-blind approach is a spectral measurement range in regions, where the solar spectrum shows gaps due to the discrete absorption of the atmosphere. Another possibility for a solar-blind pyrometric temperature measurement results from the optical behavior, i. e. the distinct angle dependence of the directional reflectance and emittance of a typical selective trough absorber coating.

Fast start-ups/shut downs and rapid load variations have become priority objectives because they guarantee high profits {{in the short term}} but cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. To this purpose, in the present work, an innovative procedure, able to predict the power plant dynamic behaviour during load variations, identify the most stressed components and estimate their lifetime reduction is presented and tested. Being combined cycles the most efficient, flexible and widespread technologies, the selected test case is a 380 MW combined cycle unit.

One advantage of using Ca as the molecule-forming reagent is that spectral interferences are extremely unlikely in the spectral range of its strongest absorption. Another advantage is that Ca acts both as molecule forming reagent and chemical modifier, so that no other reagent has to be added, making the method very simple. The only disadvantage is that Ca has a somewhat negative influence on the graphite <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The limit of detection was found to be 0. 16 mgL− 1 F, corresponding to 1. 6 ng F absolute, and the calibration curve was linear in the range between 0. 5 and 25 mgL− 1 with a correlation coefficient of R= 0. 9994.

40|$|Simultaneous Multi-Element Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (SIMAA 6000) {{has been}} used to {{determine}} groups of elements (up to four) simultaneously, by using 2 -operating and 4 -operating modes. A direct, simple, fast and accurate methodology for the simultaneous multi-element determination have developed. Compromised conditions (e. g. temperature program and use of universal modifier) for the multi-element mode have been determined. The temperature program has been carefully optimized for the multi-element mode taking into account all analytes to be determined. The optimization depends on the elements to be determined simultaneously and the matrix. Also, a universal powerful matrix modifier {{has been used}} in order to increase the stability of the elements (especially the volatile elements). This has permitted the use of a common temperature program including volatile and less volatile elements. The Pd+Mg mixture modifier has stabilized the high and mid volatile elements. For less volatile elements, the modifier had no stabilization effect on these elements. But the modifier in this case has prevented the formation of refractory compounds which increase the volatilization process of these elements. Ir coating of the tube or platform has extended significantly the <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime.</b> The sensitivity values for the multi-element determination were comparable to those of the single-element. The decreasing in sensitivity values is a result of using higher atomization temperature in the multi-element mode and/or decreasing the lamp intensities. The detection limits values of the multi-element determination were higher than those of the single-element which is mainly as a result of decreasing the lamp intensities in the multi-element mode compared to the single-element mode. Another effect which could cause the higher detection limits is the use of higher atomization temperature. The operational conditions (the temperatures, use of modifier, and the operating mode) have affected the absorption signals of the elements.

40|$|In {{solar tower}} plants {{absorber}} tubes {{are the main}} components of various solar receivers, e. g. steam, salt, pressurized air receivers. The solar radiation on the absorber tube causes an inhomogeneous temperature distribution because most of the solar radiation along the tube circumference is one-sided. The resulting internal stresses of the <b>tube</b> decrease the <b>lifetime</b> and the maximum fluid temperature significantly, especially when heat transfer coefficients are low. Within the projects SOLHYCO and FUTUR a profiled multilayer tube (PML) is currently under development in order to reduce this problem. It consists of three metallic layers: a high temperature nickel-based alloy at the outer side, a copper layer as intermediate layer and another high temperature nickel-based alloy at the inner side of the tube. The outer layer provides the structural strength while the copper is used to conduct the heat from the irradiated side to the opposite side. The inner layer protects the copper from corrosion and oxidation at high temperatures. In addition, a wire coil is inserted (profiled) to increase the heat transfer on the inside. The PML is manufactured in a hydro-forming process by deforming the tube composite with water under high pressure. To demonstrate the performance and to determine the heat transfer, the pressure loss and the temperature distribution, a test loop was built to simulate the different loads under laboratory conditions. The thermo hydraulic measurements and finite element calculations show that the temperature gradient and the maximum temperature can be reduced significantly. Based on these studies the advantages of the PML in comparison to common tubes will be presented as well as several possibilities for future improvements...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the dynamic processes within the gun barrel during the firing process in exploitation. It generally defines {{the basic principles of}} constructing tube elements, and shows the distortion of the basic geometry of the tube interior due to wear as well as the impact it causes during exploitation. The article also defines basic empirical models as well as a model based on fracture mechanics for the calculation of a use-life of the barrel, and other elements essential for the safe use of the barrel as the basic weapon element. Erosion causes are analysed in order to control and reduce wear and prolong the lifetime of the gun barrel. It gives directions for the reparation of barrels with wasted resources. In conclusion, the most influential elements of tube wear are given as well as possible modifications of existing systems, primarily propellant charges, with a purpose of prolonging lifetime of gun barrels. The guidelines for a proper determination of the lifetime based on the barrel condition assessment are given as well. INTRODUCTION The barrel as the basic element of each weapon is described as well as the processes occurring during the firing that have impulsive character and are accompanied by large amounts of energy. The basic elements of barrel and itheir constructive characteristics are descibed. The relation between Internal ballistics, ie calculation of the propellant gas pressure in the firing process, and structural elements defined by the barrel material resistance is shown. In general, this part of the study explains the methodology of the gun barrel structural elements calculation, ie. barrel geometry, taking into account the degrees of safety in accordance with Military Standards.   TUBE WEAR AND DEFORMATIONS The weapon barrel gradually wears out during exploitation due to which it no longer satisfies the set requirements. It is considered that the barrel has experienced a lifetime when it fails to fulfill the most important requirements of Military Standards (muzzle velocity, caliber size and shooting accuracy). In studies of barrel wear, there are numerous theories that explain barrel wear as thermal, mechanical and chemical effects of the projectile and propellant gas on the inner tube surface. It was found that barrel wear is a result of simultaneous effects of all factors mutually linked and very complex, so that, theoretically speaking, they cannot be uniformly determined. The extent of effects of particular factors in the wear process depends on the type of weapon systems and exploitation conditions (mode of fire, intensity and mode of barrel cooling, maintenance, storage conditions, etc.). It is considered that, for small arms, the main factor of wear is the effect of projectiles on the barrel while for artillery weapon barrels it is the erosive effect of powder gases. A life-death barrel which is determined by "ballistic death," is not necessary to be discarded, ie reparation can be done by "new calibration". The procedure of barrel reparation is economically acceptable and gives the possibility of extension of working lifetime and modification of the gun barrel. METHODS OF BARREL LIFE-TIME CALCULATION The conditions for calculating the gun barrel lifetime are described. Since the barrel lifetime depends primarily on the exploitation regime, the usage procedure (shooting program in the military terminology) Is prescribed for each individual weapon in particular. T he lifetime empirical calculation method s discussed here comprise the methods of French and Russian scientists, i. e. Justrov, Linte, Gabo and Orlov. They are mainly based on empirical constants and elements of the barrel, bullet, projectile velocity and mode of fire. These methods are only partially reliable and cannot predict with certainty the barrel lifetime, - for example, some expression s state that lifetime increases with the increase in initial velocity and barrel caliber, which is incorrect and contrary to the results of the exploitation in practice. As far as modern methods are concerned, the principles of fracture mechanics according to the Paris expression and the modified expression of Smith-O'Braski are discussed. A reference value is the crack dimensions, i. e. material fatigue, and, due to the regime of exploitation, temperature, material, pressure, etc. are also taken into account. For the purpose of controlled wear and extension of the barrel lifetime, the following means for wear reduction are used: agents for lowering the tube surface temperature; so-called "cold" gunpowders; less erosive propellant charges; reduction of the leading ring stress using so-called "inert" materials which provide the necessary rotation of projectiles and reliable sealing of propellant gases along the tube and the use of improved types of barrel materials or the use of coatings and layers (liners) resistant to three main causes of erosion. The application of these barrel materials significantly increases the barrel lifetime (Tables 2 and 3). CONCLUSION The problem of tube wear and the definition of a method for predicting <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime</b> is very complex and multidisciplinary. This problem requires a team work of experts that would cover the following fields: mechanics of weapons, internal and external ballistics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, strength of materials, fracture mechanics, metallurgy, physical chemistry, maintenance and diagnostics. Since diagnostics, i. e. the determination of the tube technical conditions,  precedes a prognosis of the tube service lifetime, it is logical that the first step towards solving this complex problem is to estimate the conditions, which should serve as a good basis for a proper evaluation of the <b>tube</b> <b>lifetime.</b>  </p...|$|E
