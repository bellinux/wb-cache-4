The Cadet Program Update (CPU) brings new teaching materials and incorporates more contemporary educational and youth development methods. Similar updates to the Sea and Army Cadet programs rationalize the connectivity {{between the three}} programs and more efficiently provides the training that is common to all three elements.|$|E

After completing his college career in 1981, Larson was tired of swimming and quit, only to return to competition a year later because he missed the focus. Larson continued his training with <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>that</b> coach Randy Reese had created for post-college swimmers in Gainesville, Florida.|$|E

The Bush administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>that</b> began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.|$|E
