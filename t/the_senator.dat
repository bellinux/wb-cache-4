5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> {{was still}} uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much less attention than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media.

5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks {{briefly to}} Sen. Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that <b>the</b> <b>Senator</b> was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

[...] Previous media predictions of where <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> would end up ranged from fourth in the conference to out of the playoffs. The Hockey News had placed <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> ninth in <b>the</b> conference, while ESPN's John Buccigross predicted <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> would end up in eleventh.

5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} Stanley Cup play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many Stanley Cups <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> were Stanley Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were champions in 1910. In both seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were <b>the</b> undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.|$|R

Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with <b>the</b> <b>senator,</b> who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months.

50|$|In hist {{first season}} as head coach, Kleinedorst lead <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> to a fifth place finish in the East Division.

Once the Ottawa papers {{found out about the}} court case, the secret was out. The two sides quickly settled to minimize the publicity.|$|R

5|$|The {{avalanche}} of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment. The general considered asking retired Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts {{to evaluate the}} legality of the Fund, but time constraints ruled him out. Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse to audit the Fund's records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> should leave the ticket.|$|E

50|$|In the 2012-13 offseason, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> {{made several}} moves in free agency, {{including}} bringing back former player Andre Benoit {{to be the}} Senators' captain.
