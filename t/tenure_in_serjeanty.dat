5000|$|The sovereign's domestics {{were his}} {{officers}} of state, and the leading dignitaries {{of the palace}} were the principal administrators of the kingdom. The royal household itself had, in its turn, grown out of an earlier and more primitive [...] "thegnhood", and among the most eminent and powerful of the king's thegns were his [...] "dishthegn," [...] his [...] "bowerthegn," [...] and his horsethegn or staller. In Normandy {{at the time of}} the Conquest a similar arrangement, imitated from the French court, had long been established, and the Norman dukes, like their overlords the kings of France, had their seneschal or steward, their chamberlain and their constable. After the Norman Conquest, the ducal household of Normandy was reproduced in the royal household of England; and since, in obedience to the spirit of feudalism, the great offices of the first had been made hereditary, the great offices of the second were made hereditary also, and were thenceforth held by the grantees and their descendants as holder of <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> grand <b>serjeanty</b> of the crown.|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the returns to {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector, but no significant return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation <b>tenure.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the strong return to formal sector tenure, we find significant returns to potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
