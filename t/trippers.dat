5|$|The {{concert hall}} {{had its own}} {{in-house}} orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier's revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by day <b>trippers.</b> A top-deck entrance {{was added to the}} hall in 1932. The pier's central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing onto the beach. The pilot sustained head injuries. The Typhoon was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight.|$|E
5|$|To allow steamers {{to bring}} day <b>trippers</b> to Weston-super-Mare from ports {{on both the}} English and Welsh side of the Bristol Channel, a landing jetty was {{extended}} {{on the west side}} of the island. The Severn Estuary has the second highest tidal range in the world second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day <b>trippers,</b> 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of Manor Farm {{and the local}} woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931. Park Wood was sold for £28,100 with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip. King's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day <b>trippers</b> from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new buildings were constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In many {{application}} domains, {{there is}} a need for learning algorithms that generate accurate as well as comprehensible classifiers. In this paper, we present TRIPPER- a rule induction algorithm that extends RIPPER, a widely used rule-learning algorithm. <b>TRIPPER</b> exploits knowledge in the form of taxonomies over the values of features used to describe data. We compare the performance of <b>TRIPPER</b> with that of RIPPER on benchmark datasets from the Reuters 21578 corpus using WordNet (a human-generated taxonomy) to guide rule induction by <b>TRIPPER.</b> Our experiments show that the rules generated by <b>TRIPPER</b> are generally more comprehensible and compact and in the large majority of cases at least as accurate as those generated by RIPPER. 1...|$|R

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are 2.4 million day <b>trippers</b> annually. While businesses appreciate the tourism, it creates a parking problem for the city. There are 1,780 paved parking spaces and 607 spaces on the streets downtown, near the beach.|$|E

In 1831 the Victory and Lady of the Lake made daily sailings from the Chain Pier to the same destinations. The lowest fare to Largo was 2 shillings. Stagecoach connections were available from there to Anstruther and St Andrews.|$|E
25|$|Waiheke is {{a popular}} holiday spot, and during the main summer season, {{especially}} around Christmas and Easter, its population increases substantially due {{to the number of}} holiday homes being rented out, corporate functions and dance parties at vineyards and restaurants, the Wine Festival and the Jazz Festival and weekend <b>trippers</b> from around the country and the world. The population increases significantly, rents go up, almost all homes and baches are full and a festive atmosphere exists.|$|E
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to foresee, {{in the spring of}} 1944, the present cult of the English country house.

So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity. Brideshead today would be open to <b>trippers,</b> its treasures rearranged by expert hands and the fabric better maintained than it was by Lord Marchmain.|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the railway {{connection}} to the Welsh valleys in 1878 came the regular influx of day <b>trippers,</b> often hundreds of them at weekends and bank holidays. The developing summer holiday trade was supported by a large number of quality hotels that provided nearly two thousand bedspaces. The biggest and grandest of the hotels were the Esplanade Hotel on the seafront built in 1887, The Marine Hotel {{at the mouth of the}} docks, The Royal Hotel at the top of Arcot Street, The Washington Hotel opposite the library and The Glendale and Lansdowne hotels on Plymouth Road. Apart from the major hotels, accommodation was also available at the smaller Dock Hotel, Penarth Hotel, Ship Hotel, Westbourne Hotel, Plymouth Hotel, Windsor Hotel, Railway Hotel and dozens of mariners' lodging houses at the top end of the town. All have now closed with the exception of the Glendale and a handful of small and more recent bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E
25|$|The major {{economic}} {{activity in the}} parish is agriculture and the parish encompasses several large farms. Most agriculture centres around dairying, with arable crops such as potato and cauliflower being farmed {{as well as some}} raising of pigs and sheep. As with much of Cornwall, fishing is an important source of income and employment. Many smaller crabbers and landline fishermen operate from the various coves and harbours on the rocky shore. Before its closure {{at the turn of the}} millennium the transatlantic telephone cable station, and telecommunications educational facility, run by Cable and Wireless at Porthcurno provided further employment opportunities in the neighbouring parish of St Levan. Its central location in west Penwith and proximity to popular tourist attractions such as the Minack Theatre, Land's End and the Blue Flag beach at Sennen Cove, mean that St Buryan enjoys a healthy income from visitors, both day <b>trippers</b> and those renting accommodation, during the summer months.|$|E

500|$|Many {{disasters}} have befallen {{the residents}} of the East End, both in war and in peace. In particular, as a maritime port, plague and pestilence have disproportionately fallen on {{the residents of}} the East End. The area most afflicted by the Great Plague (1665) was Spitalfields, and cholera epidemics broke out in Limehouse in 1832 and struck again in 1848 and 1854. Typhus and tuberculosis were also common in the crowded 19th century tenements. The [...] was a passenger steamer crowded with day <b>trippers</b> returning from Gravesend to Woolwich and London Bridge. On the evening of 3 September 1878, she collided with the steam collier Bywell Castle (named for Bywell Castle) and sank into the Thames in under four minutes. Of the approximately 700 passengers, over 600 were lost.|$|E
500|$|The 1927 New York Yankees team is {{considered}} one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderer's Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round <b>trippers.</b> Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2–2 tie. [...] "Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted [...]356, drove in 164 runs and slugged [...]772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, [...] "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team." ...|$|E
