5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> a result of signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results {{in the production of}} peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E

40|$|To {{delineate}} possible {{factors influencing}} {{the magnitude of}} <b>the</b> GH <b>response</b> to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), eight young healthy men participated in seven 16 -h studies involving saline infusions or injections of 0. 3 Mg/kg GHRH at various times of day and stages of sleep. GH <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> quantified by deconvolution, a procedure allowing for secretory rates to be estimated from peripheral levels. While <b>the</b> plasma <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> monophasic, deconvolution revealed that <b>the</b> secretory <b>response</b> to GHRH generally included several distinct bursts in rapid succession. The intersubject variability of GH <b>responses</b> <b>was</b> very wide, but for a given subject, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> quite reproducible (mean ± SEM coefficient of variation, 21 ± 3 %). When GHRH was given during the waking period, the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> {{directly related to the}} amount of spontaneous GH secretion, negatively correlated with circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and was not influenced by time of day. When GHRH was given during slow wave sleep, the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> enhanced. When GHRH was given during rapid eye movement sleep, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>was</b> similar to that observed during wake. Awakenings during sleep consistently inhibited <b>the</b> secretory <b>response</b> to GHRH, and resumption of sleep was associated with a reappearance of the secretory process. Thus, in normal men of similar age and body weight, <b>the</b> GH <b>response</b> to GHRH <b>is</b> dependent on the sleep or wake condition, circulating levels of IGF-I, and, possibly, genetic and lifestyle factors.

25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to gluten proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} gluten sensitivity. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E

An earlier phasic <b>response</b> <b>was</b> observed after fast-increase stimulations in two subjects.

40|$|Characteristics {{of sensory}} responses. Even though sensory <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> diverse and occur in {{different}} complex environments, {{it is possible}} to derive some characteristics common to all responses: 1) For a given subject <b>the</b> sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> unusual and abnormal because two conditions must be respected: the individuality of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> and <b>the</b> blind presentation of the samples. 2) When it hasn't <b>been</b> learned, <b>the</b> sensory <b>response</b> <b>is,</b> more or less, specific to the subject who gives <b>the</b> <b>response.</b> 3) <b>The</b> sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> not only a mechanical translation of events produced at the receptor level; it is an event which is largely cognitive. 4) <b>The</b> sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> changeable and unstable in time {{because of the nature of}} the nervous system and the conditions of taking the samples. 5) <b>The</b> sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> often obtained by means of verbal expression and the words may imperfectly translate the perception.

For coyotes, the prairie dogs move to the entrance of a burrow and stand outside the entrance, observing the coyote, while those prairie dogs that were inside the burrows will come out to stand and watch as well. For domestic dogs, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>is</b> to observe, standing in place where they were when the alarm was sounded, again with the underground prairie dogs emerging to watch.|$|E

25|$|Child {{partitions}} do {{not have}} direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of virtual devices.

If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will {{gain access to the}} physical devices. Parent partitions run a Virtualization Service Provider (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a Virtualization Service Client (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent to the guest OS.|$|E
