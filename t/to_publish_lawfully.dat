40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to know whether brand image, {{motivation}} <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscript, affiliation with School of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University, and prior publication experience in journals of the School of Medicine influenced the interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> in those journals. The higher the numbers of respondents showing interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> in the journals, the better are chances to select high quality manuscripts with potentially more citations and broader readership. A sample survey was conducted involving 120 respondents, who may send their manuscripts to the journals. Questionaires for data collection were adapted from Shukla (2010) to measure the interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscript, from Sondoh et al. (2007) for perception on brand image, and from Miller and Bedeian (2010) for motivation <b>to</b> <b>publish.</b> The questionaires were distributed to respondents and selfadministered before being handed to the researcher. Results of the study suggest that perception on brand image is the strongest predictor of interest <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> manuscripts in journals catered by the School of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University. Motivation <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> only weakly predicts interest <b>to</b> <b>publish,</b> and is not significant statistically. Affiliation and prior publication do not seem to be associated with interest <b>to</b> <b>publish.</b> Efforts <b>to</b> improve brand awareness, recognition, and perceived associations with positive attributes of the journals would increase manuscript submission, citations and readership among loyal readers and writers. Brand image is a useful feature in marketing theories which can be applied in the improvement of manuscript submission to academic journals...|$|R
