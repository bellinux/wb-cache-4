5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

If so, <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became supernovae, releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium.

5|$|The large convoys of East Indiamen {{were among}} the {{principal}} targets for any French raider. <b>These</b> <b>huge</b> ships sailed from Britain with general cargo, or often military stores and troops, to India or other ports in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, or China. There they would sell their cargoes and take on spices, tea, silk and other luxury goods before making the return journey to Britain. A round trip took over a year and an East Indiaman sailing to Britain would routinely carry {{hundreds of thousands of}} pounds worth of trade goods; one large convoy that sailed from Canton in January 1804 was worth over £8 million. East Indiamen were well-protected, armed with up to 30guns, and generally travelled in large convoys in which the ships could provide one another with mutual protection. Such convoys often had a Royal Navy escort, usually including a ship of the line.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive boa constrictors are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live boa constrictors were imported into the United States. <b>These</b> <b>huge</b> numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on some wild populations. Boa constrictors have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, boa constrictors are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they {{have an important role}} in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable periods of Malta's history is the temple period, {{starting}} around 3600 BC. The Ġgantija Temple in Gozo {{is one of the}} oldest free-standing buildings in the world. The name of the complex stems from the Maltese word ġgant, which reflects the magnitude of the temple's size. Many of the temples are in the form of five semicircular rooms connected at the centre. It has been suggested that these might have represented the head, arms and legs of a deity, since one of the commonest kinds of statue found in these temples is a fat woman — a symbol of fertility. The Temple period lasted until about 2500 BC, at which point the civilization that raised <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> monoliths seems to have disappeared. There is much speculation about what might have happened and whether they were completely wiped out or assimilated.|$|E

500|$|When {{compared}} to the common Eurasian models {{of the development of}} civilization, Norte Chico's differences are striking. A total lack of ceramics persists across the period. The BBC observes that Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art. In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: [...] "In the Norte Chico we see almost no visual arts. No sculpture, no carving or bas-relief, almost no painting or drawing—the interiors are completely bare. What we do see are <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> mounds—and textiles." ...|$|E

Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication.

500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate <b>these</b> <b>huge</b> hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt." [...] At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen Paul Martin, Johnny Oduya and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries.|$|E

This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. <b>These</b> <b>huge</b> pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
