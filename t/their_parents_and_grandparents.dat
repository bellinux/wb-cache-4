25|$|Many Armenians {{still had}} {{nationalist}} sentiments, {{even though they}} were discouraged from expressing them publicly. On April 24, 1965, tens of thousands of Armenians flooded the streets of Yerevan to remind the world of the horrors that <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandparents</b> endured during the Armenian Genocide of 1915. This was the first public demonstration of such high numbers in the USSR, which defended national interests rather than collective ones. In the late 1980s, Armenia was suffering from pollution. With Mikhail Gorbachev's introduction of glasnost and perestroika, public demonstrations became more common. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan because of the USSR's inability to address simple ecological concerns. Later on, with the conflict in Karabakh, the demonstrations obtained a more nationalistic flavour. Many Armenians began to demand statehood.|$|E
25|$|Cappadocian, {{also known}} as Cappadocian Greek or Asia Minor Greek, is a mixed {{language}} spoken in Cappadocia (Central Turkey). The language originally diverged from the Medieval Greek of the Byzantine Empire following the Seljuq Turk victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. As {{a result of the}} population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, all Cappadocian Greeks were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard Modern Greek and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandparents.</b> The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard Modern Greek. A survey of Cappadocian speakers and language use is currently in preparation.|$|E

The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations.

40|$|There exists convincing {{evidence}} to support the view that parenting style is important to child development. There has been increasing attention paid to the antecedents of parental behaviour {{and the extent to which}} previous experience of being parented influences subsequent parenting. This is an area dominated by quantitative research. Evidence suggests the transgenerational transmission of attachment style, and modelling of behaviour has also been implicated in the process oftransmission. In addition, several mediating factors have qeen identified. However, across the spectrum of adaptive and problematic parent-child relations, there has been a failure to clarify which factors determine transgenerational continuity or discontinuity of parenting. Whilst theoretical models emphasise the reciprocal nature of parent-child relations, there has been a lack of empirical validation oftransactional models. There has been a lack of attention paid to parents' perspectives regarding factors that influence <b>their</b> <b>parenting.</b> The present study adopted a qualitative methodology in order to explore parents' and grandparents' experiences of <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> the extent to which the parents were influenced by the way in which they were parented.

At first, no doubt, they begged in earnest hope of getting some baiocchi; but, by and by, perceiving that we had determined not to give them anything, they made a joke of the matter, and began to laugh and to babble, and turn heels over head, still keeping about us, like a swarm of flies, and now and then begging again with all their might. There were as few pretty faces as I ever saw among {{the same number of}} children; and they were as ragged and dirty little imps as any in the world, and, moreover, tainted the air with a very disagreeable odor from their rags and dirt; rugged and healthy enough, nevertheless, and sufficiently intelligent; certainly bold and persevering too; so {{that it is hard to}} say what they needed to fit them for success in life.

Yet these people kept their houses over their heads; had firesides in winter, I suppose, and food out of their little gardens every day; pigs to kill, chickens, olives, wine, and a great many things to make life comfortable. The children, desperately as they begged, looked in good bodily ease, and happy enough; but, certainly, there was a look of earnest misery in the faces of some of the old women, either genuine or exceedingly well acted.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{project is}} a two part effort, {{including}} a creative project with a research paper as a supplement. The title of my project "Facing Poverty" is a very literal translation of the message this project conveys. The drawing depicts one child's face to emphasize the issue of facing poverty. The face in the drawing is a child {{living in the city}} of Quito, Ecuador. The shaded background is an outline of the country of Ecuador. Children living in third world countries are not only deprived of food and proper health care (as generally assumed by the definition of poverty) but are also deprived of the opportunity to have a better life through education. How can the cycle of poverty be broken if there is no education to foster growth and development in a country that so desperately needs it? For these reasons, the project is called "Facing Poverty" because with or without making the choice, this child and many others in her generation, will follow in the path of <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>grandparents,</b> <b>and</b> great <b>grandparents</b> in a seemingly never-ending cycle of poverty.
