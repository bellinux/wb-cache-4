5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> plexus, trachea, esophagus and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cardiac</b> glycosides are {{powerful}} drugs from medicinal plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and digitoxin which support {{the beating of}} the heart, and act as diuretics.|$|E
50|$|Coronary {{circulation}} is {{the circulation}} {{of blood in the}} blood vessels of the heart muscle (myocardium). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are the coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein, <b>the</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> vein, <b>the</b> small <b>cardiac</b> vein, <b>the</b> smallest <b>cardiac</b> veins, and <b>the</b> anterior <b>cardiac</b> veins.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cardiac</b> {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. <b>The</b> <b>cardiac</b> skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> muscle â€“ a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. <b>The</b> <b>cardiac</b> muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E

50|$|Coronary {{circulation}} is {{the circulation}} {{of blood in the}} blood vessels of the heart muscle (myocardium). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein, <b>the</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> vein, <b>the</b> small <b>cardiac</b> vein and <b>the</b> anterior <b>cardiac</b> veins.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein usually ascends to the {{anterior}} interventricular sulcus and turns leftward in the coronary sulcus to transition into the coronary sinus. We present a rare {{case in which}} <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein drained directly into {{the boundary between the}} superior vena cava and the right atrium. <b>The</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein originated from the apex cordis at the distal 1 / 3 of the interventricular sulcus, ascended along {{the anterior}} interventricular sulcus and drained directly into the boundary between the superior vena cava and the right atrium. In this case, the coronary sinus existed and the oblique vein of the left atrium was absent. In addition, there was no communicating branch between <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein and <b>the</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> vein. These findings suggest a possible relationship between the course and drainage of <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein and <b>the</b> absence of the oblique vein of the left atrium. Moreover, we speculate that the drainage of <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein and <b>the</b> existence of a communicating branch between <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein and <b>the</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> vein is a related from of the coronary sinus...|$|R
5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction.

5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from <b>the</b> great <b>cardiac</b> vein (receiving <b>the</b> left atrium and both ventricles), <b>the</b> posterior <b>cardiac</b> vein (draining <b>the</b> back of the left ventricle), <b>the</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> vein (draining <b>the</b> bottom of {{the left and right}} ventricles), and small <b>cardiac</b> veins. <b>The</b> anterior <b>cardiac</b> veins drain <b>the</b> front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|R
5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. <b>The</b> <b>cardiac</b> action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E

It was claimed by Ginger himself in an interview with Kerrang! magazine, that the audition for Wildhearts bassist Danny McCormack consisted of taking LSD and attending a <b>Cardiacs</b> concert. <b>The</b> link with <b>the</b> <b>Cardiacs</b> continued with <b>the</b> group's guitarist Jon Poole playing bass on Black Leather Mojo.|$|R
50|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> plexus.|$|E
5|$|The mediastinal {{surface of}} the right lung is {{indented}} {{by a number of}} nearby structures. The heart sits in an impression called <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> impression. Above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close {{to the top of the}} lung is a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. There is a groove for the esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> middle <b>cardiac</b> nerve (great <b>cardiac</b> nerve), <b>the</b> {{largest of}} <b>the</b> three <b>cardiac</b> nerves, {{arises from the}} middle {{cervical}} ganglion, or from the trunk between the middle and inferior ganglia.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, they {{released}} their self-titled album (sometimes erroneously {{referred to as}} Tree Tops High) on cassette, available only through <b>the</b> <b>Cardiacs</b> fanclub. It was eventually released commercially on CD in 1995.|$|R
50|$|It {{is noted}} for hosting a gig by Britpop band Blur in June 1995, where 27,000 fans saw the band {{supported}} by The Boo Radleys, Sparks, John Shuttleworth, Dodgy and <b>The</b> <b>Cardiacs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the betaâ€“1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus <b>the</b> <b>cardiac</b> action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
