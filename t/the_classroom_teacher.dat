5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher,</b> whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

The goal of this education was to present the knowledge and skills of an older generation to the new generation of students, and to provide students with an environment in which to learn. The process paid little attention (beyond <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher)</b> to whether or not students learn any of the material.|$|E

2500|$|According to Dewey, this {{propensity}} {{and passion}} for intellectual {{growth in the}} profession {{must be accompanied by}} a natural desire to communicate one’s knowledge with others. [...] “There are scholars who have [...] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. [...] To the ‘natural born’ teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35). [...] For Dewey, it is not enough for <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.|$|E
2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> has the mental propensity {{to overcome the}} demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers {{must be aware of}} how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> “is possessed by {{a recognition of the}} responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils” (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.37). [...] For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 & Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. [...] As Dewey notes, “this further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.34).|$|E

2500|$|Dewey {{believed}} that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. [...] For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one’s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. [...] "No one," [...] according to Dewey, [...] "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [...] who does not retain [...] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [...] entire career" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.34). [...] According to Dewey, {{it is not that}} the “teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,” rather, “a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: [...] history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35). [...] <b>The</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> {{does not have to be}} a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{emphasis}} is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is “impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now” (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.25). [...] However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. [...] While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a “lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill and character” (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.242) of the nation’s workforce. [...] As Dewey notes, {{there is a lack of}} these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. [...] According to Dewey, the profession of <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> is to produce the intelligence, skill and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.|$|E
2500|$|For many, education’s {{purpose is}} to train {{students}} for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed {{to meet the needs}} of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). [...] For Dewey, the school and <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher,</b> as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. [...] Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. [...] It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. [...] If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} differences and similarities of judgment between art <b>teachers</b> and <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> concerning <b>the</b> art curriculum in the elementary school and to bring these differences and similarities into focus. This study involved art <b>teachers</b> and <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> at two elementary schools in Anderson, Indiana during the Fall quarter of the 1974 - 75 school year. Fifteen art <b>teachers</b> and twenty-four <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> responded to <b>the</b> questionnaire used in the study. The questionnaire was designed to determine if there are differences between the perceptions of art and non-art teachers of the objectives of art in the elementary school curriculum and in their respective opinions concerning specific aspects of elementary art education. Identical questionnaires were distributed to <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> in an inner city school and in an upper middle class school in Anderson, Indiana. The same questionnaire was given to all art teachers in the Anderson school system. The questionnaires were distributed on February 3, 1975 and were to be returned to the researcher by February 10, 1975. The questionnaire consisted of thirty-two items. Fifteen items related to the objectives of art education in the elementary school and seventeen items elicited the opinions of teachers concerning specified aspects of art education. Fifty-five questionnaires were distributed. Of these questionnaires, seventeen were given to art teachers and thirty-eight were given to <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> Of <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers,</b> twenty-four responded while fifteen art teachers responded. There was a sixty-three percent response from <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> and an eighty percent response from the art teachers. Both the art and the non-art teachers were generally in accord with the objectives and opinions presented in the questionnaire. Both groups felt elementary art instruction should have the objectives of providing the students with an avenue of personal expression and provide an atmosphere which nurtures a child's self-confidence. The two groups also felt that the art teacher should have the same privileges and responsibilities as <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> This attitude was reflected in the responses which indicated that both groups felt that art teachers should have time for advanced planning and preparation and should have a fully equipped art classroom to work in. The two groups differed somewhat on the objectives of elementary art education in teaching aesthetic qualities. A larger percentage of art <b>teachers</b> than of <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> expressed agreement with <b>the</b> objectives. <b>The</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> also indicated that they preferred to have some voice in the choice of materials selected for use in the elementary art class rather than permitting the art teacher to have complete control of this area. Although both groups of teachers agreed that there should be regularly scheduled art instruction geared to the degree of difficulty the child can master, they did not agree on the amount of structure the elementary art program should contain. <b>The</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers</b> were in favor of a more rigidly structured art program while the art teachers preferred more freedom in the art program. Both the art and non-art teachers are going to find it necessary to communicate to each other their ideas of the role and the need for the professional art instructor in the elementary school as well as work together to develop an art curriculum acceptable to both groups. Further studies are needed to discover methods of opening the lines of communication between the art instructors and <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers.</b> Both groups have many of the same basic objectives and opinions and must learn to cooperate with one another in order to develop an adequate elementary art curriculum acceptable to all.
