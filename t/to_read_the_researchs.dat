Recent reports summarizing this research have focused educators and others across the country on what works best in teaching children <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>The</b> <b>research</b> has shown that three important aspects of beginning reading instruction are alphabetic principles, fluency, and comprehension. • Alphabetic principles include phonemic awareness and phonics instruction, {{both of which are}} key for beginning readers. • Reading fluency—reading with accuracy, speed, and proper expression—is the result of learning alphabetic principles and sight words/phrases to the point of automaticity. Fluency is built by extensive reading practice across a wide range of text types. • Reading comprehension is promoted by instruction in vocabulary, text awareness, reading strategies, and by successful teacher preparation.

This project {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} deficient vocabulary instruction {{in the middle and}} high school grades. This deficiency is mostly caused because content-area teachers tend to focus more on content and not reading comprehension and vocabulary skills. This project aimed to provide content-area teachers <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> on both <b>the</b> importance of vocabulary instruction and effective strategies to teach academic language in content area classrooms. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> provided evidence of the dangers of limited vocabulary development in early childhood. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> pointed at <b>the</b> vocabulary gap theory that framed the discussion of my project. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>research</b> proved <b>the</b> strong relationship between reading comprehension and vocabulary knowledge. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>research</b> developed <b>the</b> premise of this project, a curriculum supplement for secondary Social Studies classrooms that is founded in research and proven effective strategies. The curriculum guide provides a user-friendly option to supplement existing curriculum with research-proven explanations and strategies that work for a wide-range of teaching scenarios. Each lesson and unit is focused on primary source readings that discuss important, standards-based topics and walk the teacher through word selection, before, during and after reading activities. This project adds to the existing literature regarding the need for increased vocabulary development. Like the literature discussed, I believe that with concentrated, thoughtful instruction of vocabulary in both incidental and explicit manners, students who are struggling with word knowledge and consequently reading comprehension, will improve their literacy. One {{of the best ways to}} achieve this goal is to develop mini-lessons in a thematic manner that incorporates effective reading and vocabulary strategies. This project has developed such a supplement that can be used by a secondary level Social Studies teacher or any teacher who wishes to use it as a model for their own practice.

Tutkimustulokset osoittivat, että suomalaislapset oppivat nopeasti peruslukutaidon. Sen sijaan luetun ymmärtämisen taidot vaatisivat enemmän harjoittelua. Pitkittäisseurannassa tunnistettiin kolme erilaista lukijaryhmää. Kompetentit lukijat lukivat sujuvasti ja ymmärsivät lukemaansa. Tekniset lukijat lukivat yhtä sujuvasti kuin kompetentit lukijat, mutta heillä oli ongelmia luetun ymmärtämisessä. Heikot lukijat olivat edellisiä heikompia peruslukemisessa ja yhtä heikkoja kuin tekniset lukijat luetun ymmärtämisessä. Kansainvälisistä tutkimuksista poiketen Lerkkanen havaitsi, ettei ns. Matteus-efekti (hyvät paranevat ja heikot heikkenevät) toteutunut suomalaisten lasten kohdalla, vaan myös heikot aloittajat oppivat lukemaan ja siirtyivät taitavampiin ryhmiin. Suomessa on myös hyvin harvinaista jäädä täysin lukutaidottomaksi. The {{purpose of}} the present thesis was to {{investigate}} the critical factors in learning <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>The</b> <b>research</b> questions were: (1) what are the antecedents for the development of skilled reading performance; (2) what are the prospective relationships between phonemic awareness and <b>reading</b> performance during <b>the</b> first grade; (3) what are the prospective relationships between reading performance and writing performance during the first grade; and (4) what kinds of developmental trajectories can be identified in children’s <b>reading</b> performance during <b>the</b> first and the second grade. Four studies based on the same dataset were the outcome. The sample size was 114. First, initial reading-related skills were assessed. Word reading and reading comprehension were assessed four times during the first grade and twice during the second grade. Spelling and productive writing were also assessed four times and phonemic skills were assessed three times during the first grade. The results revealed that: (1) <b>the</b> development of <b>reading</b> performance was predicted by different antecedents depending on <b>the</b> phase of <b>reading</b> acquisition a child had reached; (2) letter knowledge, listening comprehension and visual-motor ability predicted word reading whereas initial reading skill and listening comprehension predicted reading comprehension; (3) a reciprocal relationship between phonemic awareness and reading performance existed during the first grade; (4) reciprocity between reading and spelling existed in the beginning phases of reading instruction whereas by the end of <b>the</b> first grade <b>reading</b> performance predicted spelling in a unidirectional manner; (5) productivity of writing predicted <b>the</b> development of <b>reading</b> performance during <b>the</b> first grade; (6) Competent, Technical and Poor Reader groups were identified; (7) Poor readers frequently moved to more skilled groups {{during the course of the}} first and second grades; (8) learning paths were individually constructed; and (9) progressive and regressive reading curves, in relative terms, existed among the seven typical learning paths.

Much research on complex <b>reading</b> skills remains <b>to</b> be done, especially regarding postsecondary education. The present study is designed to contribute to this research by exploring what kinds of reading skills are being taught and how students are being instructed to use these skills. The study examines features found in seven introductory composition textbooks representing six thematic approaches to composition instruction: reader, rhetoric, argument textbook, cultural studies textbook, writing-across-the-curriculum textbook, and reading-oriented textbook. Using quantitative and qualitative methodology, the study reports findings on an axis of reading instruction treatment that includes what the focus is regarding <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> treatment and what the manner is in which students are asked <b>to</b> treat <b>the</b> <b>reading.</b> <b>The</b> <b>research</b> uncovers four different foci being used in the textbooks: form, content, context, and process. It also uncovers nine different manners of instruction: imperative, explicative, directive, attentive, expressive, interpretive, evaluative, projective, and comparative used in either general reading instruction, which entails broad guidance in reading, or applied reading instruction, which entails instruction that pertains only to particular texts or “readings” in the textbooks. Most of <b>the</b> applied <b>reading</b> instruction is focused on content, while general reading instruction shows a more balanced representation between the four foci.

The result shows, (1) there is a positive correlation between students’ grammatical competence and reading comprehension (rx 1 y = 0. 64); (2) there is a positive correlation between students’ schemata and reading comprehension (rx 2 y = 0. 60), and (3) there is a positive correlation between students’ grammatical competence and schemata <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension simultaneously (Ry 12 = 0. 80). It means that the improvement of students’ grammatical competence and schemata will be in line with the improvement of students’ reading comprehension. Keywords: Grammatical competence, Schemata and Reading Comprehension...|$|R

This media is designed as an extra learning material. The population {{in this study was}} 30 blinded students between 4 th- 6 th grades who were able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Braille language. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> was conducted during the second semester in 2012 at The Bangkok School for the Blind. The method in choosing the population in the study was purposive sampling. The methodology of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> includes collecting data related to visually impaired people, the production of the tactile texture media, human anatomy and Thai traditional massage from literature reviews and field studies. This information was used for analyzing and designing 14 tactile texture pictures presented to experts to evaluate and test the media...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} comprises of four {{parts and}} an appendix, which together form a comprehen-sive report of my graduation project. Note {{this is not}} a formal thesis report. It does contain two research questions and quick answers in text and diagrams, but the final product is the design proposal in the shape of drawings and diagrams, and not a written thesis. PART 1, called the thesis plan, as it sets out the direction of <b>the</b> <b>research,</b> contains an intro-duction to the situation in the Baixa de Maputo and should be read at least partly {{in order to understand the}} context. If one is already familiar with the context, it will suffice <b>to</b> <b>read</b> only <b>the</b> <b>research</b> questions. Some of the data, information and statements in this part follow from the analysis document, which was made in the spring of 2011, following the first visit to Maputo. PART 2 briefly explains possible answers to the questions, following <b>the</b> <b>research</b> which itself is more extensively explained in the reflection chapter (part 4). The themes of <b>the</b> two <b>research</b> questions form <b>the</b> basis of the design proposal. PART 3 is the architectural core of the project and can be seen as a summary of the final design proposal, without giving attention to the process. If only interested in the urban and architec-tural design, the reader should focus on this part of the document. To limit the length of this part...|$|R

This <b>research</b> focuses on: (1) What are the forms of cooperation of teachers-parents in supporting students 2 ̆ 7 learning of <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> Quran at the Integrated Islamic Primary School SDIT Nurul Ishlah, Banda Aceh; (2) How is {{the effectiveness of the}} cooperation of teacher-parents in supporting students 2 ̆ 7 learning of <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> Quran at the school? (3) What are the obstacles encountered in the implementation of the cooperation of teachers and parents? This is by nature mixed research. Observations, interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis were used in collecting data. The data were analyzed descriptively. The results show that there have been many kinds of collaborative efforts of teacher-parents, such as meeting of teacher-parents, seminars of parenting, monitoring book of the students 2 ̆ 7 tahsīn/tahfīẓ of the Quran, personal communication, and parents 2 ̆ 7 participation in learning <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Quran at home. All these have been effective. Nevertheless, some constraints exist in the implementation of the cooperation, including the lack of attention and concern of some parents, and the lack of facilities and infrastructure that support the programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these lecture notes is to provide readers, who have some {{mathematical}} background but little or no exposure to quantum mechanics and quantum computation, with enough material <b>to</b> begin <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> literature in quantum computation and quantum information theory. This paper is a written version {{of the first of}} eight one hour lectures given in the American Mathematical Society (AMS) Short Course on Quantum Computation held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the AMS in Washington, DC, USA in January 2000, and will appear in the AMS PSAPM volume entitled "Quantum Computation. " Part 1 of the paper is an introduction the to the concept of the qubit. Part 2 gives an introduction to quantum mechanics covering such topics as Dirac notation, quantum measurement, Heisenberg uncertainty, Schrodinger's equation, density operators, partial trace, multipartite quantum systems, the Heisenberg versus the Schrodinger picture, quantum entanglement, EPR paradox, quantum entropy. Part 3 gives a brief introduction to quantum computation, covering such topics as elementary quantum computing devices, wiring diagrams, the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm. Many examples are given. A table of contents as well as an index are provided for readers who wish to "pick and choose.

40|$|In most {{professional}} (applied) disciplines, research findings {{take a long}} time to filter into practice, if they ever do at all. The result of this is under-utilisation of research results and sub-optimal practices. There are a number of reasons for the lack of knowledge transfer. On the "demand side", people working in professional practice have little time available to keep up with <b>the</b> latest <b>research</b> in their field. In addition, <b>the</b> volume of <b>research</b> published each year means that the average practitioner would not have time <b>to</b> <b>read</b> all <b>the</b> <b>research</b> articles in their area of interest even if they devoted all their time to it. From the "supply side", academic research is primarily focused on the production rather than distribution of knowledge. While they have highly developed mechanisms for transferring knowledge among themselves, there is little investment in <b>the</b> distribution of <b>research</b> results be-yond <b>research</b> communities. <b>The</b> World Wide Web provides a potential solution to this problem, as it provides a global information infrastructure for connecting those who produce knowledge (researchers) and those who need to apply this knowledge (practitioners). This paper describes two projects which use the World Wide Web to make research results directly available to support decision making in the workplace. The first is a successful knowledge management project in a health department which provides medical staff with on-line access to <b>the</b> latest medical <b>research</b> at <b>the</b> point of care. The second is a project currently in progress to implement a similar system to support decision making in IS practice. Finally, we draw some general lessons about how to improve transfers of knowledge from research and practice, which could be applied in any discipline. <br...|$|R
40|$|Theatre in Britain {{operates}} {{in a market}} economy with finance from {{both private and public}} sectors. Since 1945, and the founding of the Arts Council of Great Britain, increasing amounts of state support have been provided for activities judged to provide universal public benefits. Yet these were, for many centuries, considered beyond the remit and purpose of government, and thus reliant almost entirely on private finance. As Britain’s economic foundations remain firmly liberal, that public finance has been integrated into long-standing market mechanisms such that public and private finance have become symbiotically interconnected across the activities that define <b>the</b> industry. This <b>research</b> examines these interconnections while defining the passage of finance between the sectors and noting some of the intentions, motivations and implicit values that lie behind the decisions of those operating in each. This {{is not a question of}} comparative artistic value or any judgement of quality, although many will be tempted <b>to</b> <b>read</b> both into <b>the</b> <b>research</b> outcomes; rather it is a description of how public and private finance are now employed in the creation and presentation of theatre in Britain...|$|R
