40|$|Abstract. An {{approach}} to road recognition and ego-state tracking in monocular image sequences of traffic scenes is described. The main contribution {{of this paper}} is the adaptive recognition scheme, which deals with competitive road hypotheses, and its application in several processing steps of an image sequence analysis system. No manual initialization of the <b>tracked</b> <b>road</b> is required and the change of the road type is allowed. The road parameters to be recognized are the road width, road lane number and road curvature. For exact estimation of road curvature the translational and rotational velocities of the ego-car are assumed to be available. The estimated ego-state parameters are the camera orientation (which is derived due to vanishing point tracking) and the camera position relative to the road center line...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient approach towards road sign detection, and recognition. The proposed system {{is divided into}} three sections namely: Road Sign Detection where Colour Segmentation of the road traffic signs is carried out using HSV colour space considering varying lighting conditions and Shape Classification is achieved by using Contourlet Transform, considering possible occlusion and rotation of the candidate signs. Road Sign Tracking is introduced by using Kalman Filter where object of interest is tracked until it appears in the scene. Finally, Road Sign Recognition is carried out on successfully detected and <b>tracked</b> <b>road</b> sign by using features of a Local Energy based Shape Histogram (LESH). Experiments are carried out on 15 distinctive classes of road signs to justify that the algorithm described in this paper is robust enough to detect, track and recognize road signs under varying weather, occlusion, rotation and scaling conditions using video stream...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNonlinear normal {{vibration}} modes (NNMs) are a {{generalization of}} the normal vibrations in the linear systems. In conception of NNMs by Kauderer-Rosenberg all position coordinates can be defined from any one of them. In conception of NNMs by Lyapunov-Shaw-Pierre all phase coordinates can be defined from two selected ones. Curvilinear trajectories of NNMs in a configuration space, or in a phase space, can be obtained as power series. The NNMs theory is used to study vibrations of some linear structure connected with the single-DOF nonlinear absorber. An essentially nonlinear oscillator, a snap-through truss with three equilibrium positions, and a vibro-impact oscillator are chosen as absorbers. Construction and stability analysis of the NNMs are presented. If the localized mode is stable, and the non-localized vibration mode is unstable, the vibration energy is concentrated in the absorber. Free damped oscillations of the double <b>tracked</b> <b>road</b> vehicle with a nonlinear response of the suspension can be considered by the NNMs theory too. The 7 -DOF nonlinear model is {{used to analyze the}} suspension dynamics with smooth characteristics. The quarter-car model is considered for a case of the non-smooth characteristic of the shock absorber...|$|E
