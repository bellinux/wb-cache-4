5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held {{to determine whether there}} was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 photographs that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> prepared as evidence.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of the (still current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to {{organize}} demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> charged.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} the death penalty for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> sought the death penalty for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of his father to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E
5|$|The February 1974 {{election}} {{proved to}} be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by {{the time of his death}} was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> {{showed his}} {{fingerprints}} {{were on a}} Western Union money order of 38,000 Francs sent to the bomber Ait Ali Belkacem. Ramda claims {{that he did not}} know Belkacem, although he admits that it was his fingerprints on the money order. He claims that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> given a false interpretation of this evidence. Further evidence submitted by <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> concerns wiretaps of phone communications between Ramda and the bombers in France, a short time before and after the bombings. According to Ramda, he has not been allowed to listen to these wiretaps, and he doubts they exist. He denied having phoned the bombers and knowing them.|$|R

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
25|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> {{sought the}} death sentences, {{but due to}} his old age, he was given two {{consecutive}} life sentences (to be served concurrently) and fined Rs 2 lakhs.|$|E
5000|$|Sredoje Lukić's defence team filed {{a notice}} of appeal and its appeal brief. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> also filed a motion of appeal and its appeal briefs, {{requesting}} that Lukić's sentence be reviewed and lengthened.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> {{depended}} {{heavily on}} the investigative work of James McParland who, acting as an operative for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, had helped convict the Molly Maguires three decades earlier, and felt confident that it would convict all three.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence - Anyone charged is {{innocent}} until proven guilty. The burden of proof falls on <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> If no one “flips,” or if there isn’t a smoking gun, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> a harder time proving guilt. This may result in prosecution moving away from criminal charges, and instead choosing to pursue civil charges.|$|R
50|$|In between, Feyenoord and {{chairman}} Jorien van den Herik {{were found to}} be not guilty in 2002. The prosecutor, however appealed, but in 2005, after three years of investigations, the results stayed the same. Still, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> not given up the caseyet.|$|R
50|$|In this respect, affirmative {{defenses}} {{differ from}} ordinary defenses of right, alibi, infancy, necessity, and (in some jurisdictions, e.g., all U.S. states except Ohio) self-defense (which is an affirmative defense at common law), which <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> burden of disproving {{beyond a reasonable}} doubt.|$|R
25|$|The defence {{stated in}} their summary that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> failed to prove beyond {{reasonable}} doubt that Einem {{was guilty of}} murder and also weren't able to establish the exact cause of Kelvin's death, so therefore the jury must give Einem {{the benefit of the}} doubt.|$|E
25|$|The jury deliberated {{for more}} than two hours before they {{returned}} with their decision in the sentencing phase of the trial: Gacy was sentenced to death for the twelve counts of murder upon which <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> sought this penalty.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>had</b> {{originally}} intended to try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due {{to the findings of}} a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which had concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in his own defense.|$|E
