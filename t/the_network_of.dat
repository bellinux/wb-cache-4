5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{results of}} the concept of {{territorial}} capital suggest that the Hungarian regional economic development is defined by <b>the</b> coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Altogether three Hungarian coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> SMEs were found and analyzed longitudinally embracing 127 entrepreneurs thus 127 interviews and 127 questionnaires were conducted as well. Since <b>the</b> coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> enterprises have territorial extension, <b>the</b> advanced methods <b>of</b> <b>network</b> science and spatial econometrics were combined. The key findings show that focal firm plays outstanding role in redistributing market information, organizing mutual transportation and guarantees robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coopetitive <b>networks.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> SMEs determine significantly the new jobs creation and pay raise, in general, the accumulation of territorial capital at regional scale as well...|$|R

However, where Estes {{planned to use}} <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>of</b> conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
