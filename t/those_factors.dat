5|$|In {{addition}} to the star's diameter, questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse's extended atmosphere. The mass that makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed, and red supergiants are major contributors, yet {{the process by which}} mass is lost remain a mystery. With advances in interferometric methodologies, astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum. In July 2009, images released by the European Southern Observatory, taken by the ground-based Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), showed a vast plume of gas extending 30AU from the star into the surrounding atmosphere. This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse's surrounding atmosphere. Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse. Solving the mystery of mass loss in the late stages of a star's evolution may reveal <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the geographic rivalry between the two teams, the controversies surrounding Lane Kiffin, and the performances of the players on each team. Virginia Tech played in the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2006, losing to Georgia 31-24, and the 2009 game was its fourth appearance in the game. It was Tennessee's fifth appearance in the game, and the Volunteers had most recently lost to Clemson in the 2004 contest, 27-14. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Virginia Tech was 0-2 in games held in Atlanta during 2010, it had lost four consecutive games to SEC foes, and it had never won back-to-back bowl games (Tech won the 2009 Orange Bowl). Despite <b>those</b> <b>factors,</b> Virginia Tech was an early 4.5-point favorite and was listed as a 5.5-point favorite by spread bettors {{on the day before}} the game.|$|E

The route had the riders go through rough roads that were heavy with dust and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{some aspects of}} North Korean economy through her import behavior. We have found that for North Korean economy some {{non-market}} factors are important determinants of the import behavior. <b>Those</b> non-market <b>factors</b> are the country's political situations, its political relation with two communist superpowers, and its relation with the Western industrialized countries especially through foreign debt problems with the Western countries.

25|$|Various {{scientific}} disciplines have developed taxonomic classification systems to describe natural phenomena or individuals, like for example, plants or animals. These systems {{are based on}} specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction. Differently, in landslide classification, there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable; usually being characterised by different causes, movements and morphology, and involving genetically different material. For this reason, landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors, sometimes very subjective. In the following write-up, factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups: {{the first one is}} made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined. The second one is formed by <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions.|$|E

This school has focused on the historical evidence from ancient and medieval society in India, during the Muslim rule between the 12th and 18th centuries, and the policies of colonial British rule from 18th century to the mid-20th century.|$|E

25|$|Planetary {{habitability}} is {{the measure}} of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to have habitable environments hospitable to life, or its ability to generate life endogenously. A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable, and habitable environments {{do not need to}} contain life. Life may develop directly on a planet or satellite or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as panspermia. As the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing—in particular <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures.

25|$|Some {{critical}} psychiatrists {{criticize the}} practice of defining {{one and the same}} belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.|$|E
