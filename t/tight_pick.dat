5000|$|We {{say that}} an element, a, from T is tight if [...] The {{main part of}} the {{algorithm}} consists of a loop: As long as there is a set in S that contains an element from T which is not tight, the price of this set is increased as much as possible without violating the invariant above. When this loop exits, all sets contain some <b>tight</b> element. <b>Pick</b> all the <b>tight</b> elements to be the hitting set.|$|R

5000|$|A 10-7 {{win over}} Atlanta {{followed}} {{and set up}} the annual battle with the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers had worn the title of [...] "Team of the Decade" [...] for the 1980s and were the primary stumbling block for an otherwise resurgent Saints franchise during Jim Mora's tenure as head coach. The Sunday night, prime-time audience saw a tight contest throughout. With the Niners leading 16-10, the Saints faced first-and-goal at the San Francisco 2-yard line. Saints guard Derek Kennard was flagged for holding and, on the next play, a pass into <b>tight</b> coverage was <b>picked</b> off by 49ers cornerback Eric Davis. It was the Saints' sixth consecutive home game against the Niners decided by seven points or less.|$|R
5000|$|On April 28, 2016, the Rams {{selected}} quarterback Jared Goff from California, {{with the}} 1st overall {{pick in the}} 1st round, along with tight end Tyler Higbee and wide receiver Pharoh Cooper in the 4th round with the 110th and 117th <b>picks,</b> <b>tight</b> end Temarrick Hemingway, linebacker Josh Forrest, and wide receiver Mike Thomas in the 6th round with the 190th, 193th, and 206th picks.In June 2016, {{it was reported that}} the Rams had sold 63,000 season tickets, which was short of their goal of 70,000. Later on July 12, 2016, it was reported that they had sold 70,000 tickets, reaching their goal. In July 2016, the Rams signed a three-year agreement with UC Irvine to use the university's facilities for training camp, with an option to extend it to two more years. On July 29, 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that the Rams would host their first training-camp practice and [...] "Rams Family Day" [...] on Saturday, August 6 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which was open to the public.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} an adaptive, automatic, correlation- and clusteringbased method for greatly reducing the degree of picking inconsistency in large, digital seismic catalogs and for quantifying similarity within, and discriminating among, clusters of disparate waveform families. Innovations in the technique include (1) the use of eigenspectral methods for cross-spectral phase estimation and for providing subsample pick lag error estimates in units of time, as opposed to dimensionless relative scaling of uncertainties; (2) adaptive, cross-coherency-based filtering; and (3) a hierarchical waveform stack correlation method for adjusting mean intercluster pick times without compromising <b>tight</b> intracluster relative <b>pick</b> estimates. To solve the systems of cross-correlation lags we apply an iterative, optimized conjugate gradient technique that minimizes an L 1 -norm misfit. Our repicking technique not only provides robust similarity classification–event discrimination without making a priori assumptions regarding waveform similarity {{as a function of}} preliminary hypocenter estimates, but also facilitates high-resolution relocation of seismic sources. Although knowledgeable user input is needed initially to establish run-time parameters, significant improvement in pick consistency and waveform-based event classification may be obtained by then allowing the programs to operate automatically on the data. The process shows promise for enhancing catalog reliability {{while at the same time}} reducing analyst workload, although careful assessment of the automatic results is still important...|$|R
5000|$|The Man Who Walked Between The Towers {{follows the}} French street {{performer}} Philippe Petit in an illustrated children's book made by author Mordicai Gerstein. Philippe Petit {{had an idea}} to walk a wire between the twin towers and acted upon it with much planning and setting up. He had once walked a wire on the Notre Dame where he lived in Paris, France. Early on an August morning, since the towers were not quite finished, Philippe Petit and his friend dressed up as a construction worker and went up the south tower. They got a 440 lbs of cable into the elevator. Took {{it to the top}} 10 floors and waited until nightfall. Then they carried everything up 180 stairs into the roof. At midnight, two more friends came to help and tied a line through an arrow and shot it across to Philippe 140 feet away. It missed and landed on a ledge who crawled down the ledge of the tower to get the arrow. To the line he attached a stronger line, whom his friends pulled back and he tied it to a cable that was 5/8 of an inch thick. The cable was so heavy that it took them 3 hours to secure the line from across the two towers. By past dawn of August 7, 1974, they had tightened it between the towers. Philippe then put on his black shirt and <b>tights</b> and <b>picked</b> up his 28-foot balancing pole and started walking on the wire. He felt, [...] "Alone and absolutely free", as author Mordecai Gerstein writes. The bystanders notice someone walking between the two towers and quickly notify the police. Officers rushed to the roof of the towers and yelled to Philippe, [...] "You're under arrest!" [...] For almost an hour Philippe walked, danced, and leaped {{back and forth between the}} wire. He even laid down to rest. When he felt completely satisfied, he walked towards the tower and held out his wrists towards the handcuffs. They brought Philippe to court and the judge sentenced him to perform in the park for the children of the city. This he did happily. Though during his performance some kids jerked his wire and Philippe fell but caught himself. Now the towers are gone but the memory remains of August 7, 1974 when a man walked between the towers.|$|R
50|$|The Bears traded the third-overall pick, a 2017 third-round pick (No. 67) overall, a 2017 fourth-round pick (No. 111) and a 2018 third-round pick to the 49ers in {{exchange}} for their second-overall pick. Moving up a spot in the draft order, the Bears used it on North Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky; although he only started for one full season, Trubisky threw for 30 touchdowns and just six interceptions in 2016, including completing 68 percent of his passes and an average of 8.4 yards per pass. In the second round, the Bears traded the 36th-overall pick and a seventh-round selection (No. 211) to the Cardinals {{in exchange}} for their 45th-overall pick, a fourth- (No. 119) and sixth-rounder (No. 197), and a fourth-rounder in 2018. With the new second-round <b>pick,</b> <b>tight</b> end Adam Shaheen of the Ashland Eagles was selected; in 2016, Shaheen recorded 16 touchdown receptions, the most in a season by a tight end in NCAA Division II history. After trading their third-rounder to the 49ers, the Bears did not have a pick in that round, instead waiting until the next round to use the 112th-overall pick on Alabama safety Eddie Jackson; {{over the course of his}} college career, Jackson had nine interceptions, 12 pass breakups and five touchdowns (three on interception returns), including restricting opposing quarterbacks to a combined 38.3 passer rating when throwing his way in 2016. Also a punt returner, he averaged 23 yards on punt returns, but broke his leg on a return during a game last October. The second fourth-round pick, the 119th-overall from Arizona, was used to select North Carolina A&T running back Tarik Cohen. The , 160 lb running back attracted Internet attention in 2015 when a video surfaced of him performing a backflip and catching two footballs at the same time. With the Aggies, Cohen was named Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year during his freshman year and was the MEAC Offensive Player of the Year three times as he recorded 5,619 rushing yards during his tenure. A second Division II player, Kutztown Golden Bears offensive lineman Jordan Morgan, was drafted with Chicago's final pick (a fifth-rounder and the 147th-overall selection); the first Kutztown player to be drafted since Andre Reed in 1985, Morgan started 43 of 44 games with the Golden Bears, winning the 2016 Gene Upshaw Award and being named the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division Offensive Athlete of the Year, the first lineman to receive the honor.|$|R
