40|$|SummaryProgenitors in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> {{central nervous}} system acquire neural {{potential}} and proliferate to expand the pool of precursors competent to undergo neuronal differentiation. The formation and maintenance of neural-competent precursors are regulated by SoxB 1 transcription factors, and evidence that their expression is regionally regulated suggests that specific signals regulate neural potential in subdomains of <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> nervous system. We show that the frizzled (Fz) transmembrane receptor Xfz 5 selectively governs neural potential in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> Xenopus retina by regulating the expression of Sox 2. Blocking either Xfz 5 or canonical Wnt signaling within <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> retina inhibits Sox 2 expression, reduces cell proliferation, inhibits the onset of proneural gene expression, and biases individual progenitors toward a nonneural fate, without altering the expression of multiple progenitor markers. Blocking Sox 2 function mimics these effects. Rescue experiments indicate that Sox 2 is downstream of Xfz 5. Thus, Fz signaling can regulate the neural potential of progenitors in <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> nervous system...|$|R
