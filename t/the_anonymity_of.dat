5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} concern about <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and privacy in electronic services. Many web sites store and process personal data of users {{in order to provide}} a better service. Users prefer not to give away personal information if this can be avoided. This paper introduces a model, based on Shannon’s definition of entropy, with which <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> a set of users grouped in several subsets can be quantified in an objective way. This model is applied to a practical case in which users are associated to profiles, and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> achieved by those users, is measured under different conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{requirements}} for secure communication in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) are anonymous authentication with source non-repudiation and integrity. The existing security protocols in VANETs do not differentiate between <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> different vehicles and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided by these protocols {{is the same}} for all the vehicles in a network. To provide high level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> <b>the</b> resource requirements <b>of</b> security protocol would also be high. Hence, in a resource constrained VANET, it is necessary to differentiate between <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> different vehicles and to provide <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> to a vehicle as per its requirement. In this paper, we have proposed a novel protocol for authentication which can provide multiple levels <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in VANETs. <b>The</b> protocol makes use of identity based signature mechanism and pseudonyms to implement anonymous authentication with source non-repudiation and integrity. By controlling the number of pseudonyms issued to a vehicle and the lifetime of each pseudonym for a vehicle, the protocol is able to control <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided to a vehicle. In addition, the protocol includes a novel pseudonym issuance policy using which the protocol can ensure the uniqueness of a newly generated pseudonym by checking only a very small subset of the set of pseudonyms previously issued to all the vehicles. The protocol cryptographically binds an expiry date to each pseudonym, and in this way, enforces an implicit revocation for the pseudonyms. Analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol...|$|R
25|$|Tor {{can also}} provide {{anonymity}} to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} this concept had on church music was threefold: first, it bred a highly {{conservative}} attitude to musical composition; secondly, it stabilized the melodic tradition of certain hymns; and thirdly, it continued, for a time, <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the composer. For if a chant is of heavenly origin, then the acknowledgment received by man in transmitting it to posterity {{ought to be}} minimal. This is especially true when he deals with hymns that were {{known to have been}} first sung by angelic choirs—such as the Amen, Alleluia, Trisagion, Sanctus and Doxology. Consequently, until Palaeologan times, it was inconceivable for a composer to place his name beside a notated text in the manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} more complicated case is {{presented by the}} anonymous play sometimes known as The First Part of Richard II. This play, which exists in one incomplete manuscript copy (at the British Museum) is subtitled Thomas of Woodstock, and it is by this name that scholars since F. S. Boas have usually called it. This play treats the {{events leading up to}} the start of Shakespeare's play (though the two texts do not have identical characters). This closeness, along with <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the manuscript, has led certain scholars to attribute {{all or part of the}} play to Shakespeare, though many critics view this play as a secondary influence on Shakespeare, not as his work.|$|E

25|$|Ghettoisation among Indian Muslims {{began in}} the mid-1970s when first {{communal}} riots occurred. It got heightened after the 1989 Bhagalpur violence in Bihar and became a trend after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Soon several major cities developed ghettos, or segregated areas, where the Muslim population moved in. This trend however, did not help for the anticipated security <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> ghetto was thought to have provided. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, several such ghettos became easy targets for the rioting mobs, as they enabled the profiling of residential colonies. This kind of ghettoisation {{can be seen in}} Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and many cities of Gujarat where a clear socio-cultural demarcation exists between Hindu-dominated and Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods.|$|E
25|$|Once {{she started}} experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started {{stitching}} into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and other fabrics {{allowed her to}} use thread to highlight {{certain aspects of the}} photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E
25|$|The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) {{published}} {{a paper in}} 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating {{the spread of the}} HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize sexual education as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{rigorous}} methodology for quantifying <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided by Tor against a variety of structural attacks, i. e., adversaries that compromise Tor nodes and thereby perform eavesdropping attacks to deanonymize Tor users. First, we provide an algorithmic approach for computing <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> impact <b>of</b> such structural attacks against Tor. The algorithm is parametric in the considered path selection algorithm and is, hence, capable of reasoning about variants of Tor andalternative path selection algorithms as well. Second, we present formalizations of various instantiations of structural attacks against Tor and show that <b>the</b> computed <b>anonymity</b> impact <b>of</b> each of theseadversaries indeed constitutes a worst-case <b>anonymity</b> bound for <b>the</b> cryptographic realization of Tor. Third, we use our methodology to conduct a rigorous, large-scale evaluation of Tor 2 ̆ 7 s anonymity which establishes worst-case anonymity bounds against various structural attacks for Tor and for alternative path selection algorithms such as DistribuTor, SelekTOR, and LASTor. This yields <b>the</b> rst rigorous <b>anonymity</b> comparison between dierent path selection algorithms. As part of our analysis, we quantify <b>the</b> <b>anonymity</b> impact <b>of</b> a path selection transition phase, i. e., {{a small number of}} users decides to run an alternative algorithm while the vast majority still uses the original one.
