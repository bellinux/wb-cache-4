5|$|A writer {{tends to}} find her {{characters}} in her self, so I can <b>tell</b> <b>you...</b> <b>that</b> Nixon, Pat, Mme. Mao, Kissinger and the chorus were all 'me.' And the inner lives of Mao and Chou En-Lai, who I couldn't find in myself at all, were drawn {{from a couple of}} close acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|And, {{at the end}} of the day, that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there are plenty of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship {{and we have the}} crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E

Your doctor <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and gives you levodopa, a 60 -year-old {{treatment}} that temporarily relieves your symptoms. But over time, the medication makes you impulsive, {{and after a few}} years, your symptoms return. The doctor <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have developed resistance to your medicine and that nothing else is likely to work—your condition continues to degenerate. Sadly, this is the reality for millions of Americans suffering from Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease...|$|R

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
25|$|I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> in Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

25|$|To {{some people}} the golden era of Hip Hop was ’94. Ask someone {{a little older}} and they’ll tell you Hip Hop’s renaissance was back in ’88. Ask one of our revered pioneers and they’ll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the golden era came and went three decades ago, before most of today’s Hip Hop heads were born. Whatever the case these {{so-called}} golden eras weren’t only defined by the music or the fashion - they were characterised by something less tangible - an atmosphere, a movement.|$|E
25|$|In other words, don't {{spend the}} money unless you're sure you're {{going to have the}} legal {{environment}} to go forward. Don't {{spend the money}} unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.|$|E
5000|$|When a judge {{calls an}} {{argument}} [...] "ridiculous" [...] or [...] "frivolous," [...] {{it is absolutely}} the worst thing the judge could say. It means that the person arguing the position has absolutely {{no idea of what}} he is doing, and has completely wasted everyone's time. It doesn't mean that the case wasn't well argued, or that judge simply decided for the other side, it means that there was no other side. The argument was absolutely, positively, incompetent. The judge is not <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were [...] "wrong." [...] The judge is <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are out of your mind.|$|R

25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Mr Chifley has died. I don't {{want to try to}} talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
