5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|Released in North America on September17, 1999, American Beauty was {{positively}} received by critics and grossed over $356million worldwide. Reviewers praised most {{aspects of the}} production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey, and Ball; criticism focused on <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film's chances of Academy Award success; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for the direction, writing, and acting.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E

25|$|Angel Beats! {{is set in}} a {{world after}} death, which acts as a limbo where the dead learn to give up any {{lingering}} attachments from life before passing on. Those in this limbo can eat, feel pain, and can even die again, only to awaken later with no injuries. Objects not originally present in this world can be created from dirt depending on <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> it when alive. In the case of weapons, this can range from simple melee weapons to more complex firearms and explosives. In addition, computer programs can be used to create a mixed reality, as when Kanade creates her supernatural powers via a program called Angel Player.|$|E
25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do know the answer, when presented with questions they feel they should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|From the {{contemporary}} point of view, {{the importance of}} Schaeffer's musique concrète is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found {{it was possible to}} remove <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as tape looping and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage. The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices. Schaeffer {{was among the first to}} use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of electronic and experimental instruments in a manner similar to Luigi Russolo, whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} in the Roswell Daily Record, American {{journalist}} Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called The Marriages one of Lessing's more accessible books because, in his opinion, her tendency to philosophise works better in fantasy {{than in other}} formats. Author Lucille deView was more critical of book. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, she complained that The Marriages is not as romantic a novel as it could have been. She said that {{the fate of the}} book's mismatched lovers did not interest her, and felt that their love came across as forced instead of passionate. What could have been an emotionally charged romance became [...] "a calculated intellectual game". deView also criticised Lessing's characters, saying that they [...] "have <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> childhood fairy tales with a little Walt Disney thrown in".|$|E

500|$|Saint-Saëns {{composed}} {{more than}} sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He {{was proud of his}} connection with British choirs, commenting, [...] "One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio." [...] He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{periodic}} table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32-column form by reinstating the footnoted f-block elements into their natural position between the s- and d-blocks. Unlike the 18-column form this arrangement results in [...] "no interruptions {{in the sequence}} of increasing atomic numbers". The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the {{periodic table}} also becomes easier to see. Jensen advocates a form of table with 32 columns {{on the grounds that}} the lanthanides and actinides are otherwise relegated in the minds of students as dull, unimportant elements that can be quarantined and ignored. Despite these advantages the 32-column form is generally avoided by editors on account of its undue rectangular ratio (compared to a book page ratio), and <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> chemists with the modern form (as introduced by Seaborg).|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a mixed review, {{granting}} it {{two and a}} half stars out of five. Though he praised the score, he stated that it is [...] "more fascinating for its ambitions than for what it accomplishes" [...] and criticised the main characters for being [...] "too shallow" [...] and unengaging. Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticised the [...] "weak plot, forgettable dialogue and sloppy politics" [...] and called the lead characters [...] "empty-headed blanks". Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle called McNairy and Able a [...] "semi-interesting" [...] pair, but disliked the lack of monsters in the film, the dialogue, and <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> the story. Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post called the film [...] "a less-than-compelling relationship drama", criticising it for being unoriginal and predictable, and that hiding the monsters made them less frightening.|$|E
40|$|A new {{direction}} in social perception research is developed. The present research explored <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and time on social perception processes based on cognitive neuroscience models, social categorization models, and memory consolidation constructs. Familiarity was manipulated within an exposure task and time was manipulated by testing participants both 2 - 6 hr and 48 hr after the exposure task. Experiment 1 investigated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and {{time on the}} argument of the automaticity of social categorization and associated stereotypes by testing the argument with two separate tasks. Experiment 1 a tested <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and time on associated stereotypes and found that, with familiarity and time, participants responded to individualizing information faster than to stereotypic information. Experiment 1 b tested <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and time on social categorization and found further support for the automaticity of social categorization. Experiment 2 further investigated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and time on social perception by embedding cognitive loads within a categorization task. Experiment 2 found little support for <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> and time on social categorization and cognitive loads. The current research is discussed for its relevance to models of social perception. ...|$|R

[...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, <b>the</b> <b>familiarity</b> <b>of</b> the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is never {{going to be the same}} again".

500|$|The plot of {{the game}} was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who praised it as horrifying, compelling, and [...] "dark". 1UP.com praised the titular room as constantly maintaining a sense of unease for the player.
