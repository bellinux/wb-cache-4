50|$|A {{steering}} wheel is a wheel that turns {{to change the}} direction of a vehicle. A <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> is one that is neither a drive wheel, nor a steer wheel. Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear wheels as trailer wheels.|$|E
50|$|Instead of panniers, some riders {{prefer a}} bicycle trailer. Trailers {{are easy to}} use and allow touring with bikes on which it is {{impossible}} to attach racks. However, double wheeled trailers decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other hand, single wheel trailers are extremely maneuverable, with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.|$|E
50|$|Already in 1934 {{it became}} obvious that Renault had been right in advising to select a {{different}} suspension type. The standard one proved to be much too flimsy and especially the oil shock dampers were very maintenance intensive. Both the three vehicles built in 1935 and the two rebuilt prototypes were therefore fitted with an improved AMR 35 suspension type with rubber cylinders. Prototype 79758 had been used to test three different systems: the first with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> touching the ground, the second with five road wheels and the last was the one selected. The second type would form the basis for the Renault ZB, a lengthened export version, destined for China.|$|E

40|$|Wheel {{detachment}} from plant trailers used on public highways represents a significant {{health and safety}} hazard and major financial risk, especially for construction and utility companies that rely on these type of trailers to transport machinery such as mini excavators or road rollers. This study uncovers the antecedents of plant <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> detachment and suggests pragmatic guidance for mitigating this risk. A case study using elements of action research studies {{the problem in the}} field through direct observation and stakeholder interviews. Analysis of resulting qualitative data conceptualizes antecedents on which guidance is formulated. Risks are found to result from a combination of physical failure underpinned by inadequate human interventions and poor risk management. The primary contributions of the study are that it describes entirely novel research on <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> detachment, produces new safety guidance for businesses and practitioners that operate plant trailers, and resultantly contributes to lowering the risks identified.

40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of splash and spray around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as brakes, wheel bolts and wheel cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study. Possible containment strategies would include using flow structures to 'focus' particles into regions away from passing cars or surface treatments to capture small drops...|$|E

The results show that the train is safe running on high speed line...|$|E
50|$|A {{side dump}} truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the <b>trailer's</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>Trailers</b> that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> by dumping their loads further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.|$|R

50|$|An {{articulated}} dumper is an all-wheel drive, off-road dump truck. It has a hinge {{between the}} cab and the dump box, but is distinct from a semi-trailer truck in that the power unit is a permanent fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via hydraulic cylinders that pivot the entire tractor {{in relation to the}} trailer, rather than rack and pinion steering on the front axle as in a conventional dump truck. By this way of steering, the <b>trailers</b> <b>wheels</b> follow the same path as the front wheels. Together with all-wheel drive and low center of gravity, it is highly adaptable to rough terrain. Major manufacturers include Volvo CE, Terex, John Deere and Caterpillar.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{an important}} problem in improvement of  braking dynamics potential {{as part of}} the overall tractor train dynamics consisting of   an all-wheel drive tractor and heavy-duty trailers which are either locally manufactured or developed with the participation of the paper’s authors. The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation peat, organic fertilizers and various loads in  forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels.</b> Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate  distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a clutch coupling is switched-on. Sequence of the calculation formula has been completely carried out in the paper. They represent clear design and operational parameters of the active tractor train. Such approach has made it possible to realize them {{in the form of a}} software application which is convenient for analysis of the braking process pertaining to the investigated objects in order to select means for improvement of braking dynamics, rational parameters of multi-path wheel drive and tire completing of the active tractor train under design. The proposed information has a theoretical and practical value for specialists who are involved in development of new machine-tractor units for transport application in peat extraction, forestry, and agriculture. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{report has}} pointed out {{the need to provide}} the truck driver with a semi trailer, the ability to see the contour of the semi trailer and road {{illumination}} in the insufficient lighting conditions. The need for equipping the vehicle with additional contour light and lamps illuminating the section of the road overrun by the semi <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> has been assessed. This is particularly important during manoeuvring with such truck – semi trailer unit at night to ensure safety, as the semi trailer has a different tracking circle than the towing truck. Current regulations are too (categorical) restrictive and limiting possibility of introducing additional lights. The proposal for technically solving this problem as well as amending the regulations, has been presented. The existing technical requirements included in current regulations on lighting do {{not take into account the}} need to ensure the visibility of these areas for the truck driver with a semi trailer.

50|$|A 'fifth-wheel' is {{a travel}} trailer {{supported}} by a hitch {{in the center of}} the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be connected by simply driving the tow vehicle under the <b>trailer.</b> Fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits over the bed of the pickup, it also reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a gooseneck hitch is an option to fifth-wheel.|$|R
50|$|The sixth Aerocar (N4345F) {{is painted}} red with silver wings. It {{was the final}} flying car effort by Moulton Taylor. The vehicle began life {{as one of the}} {{original}} Aerocars, but Taylor bought it back from a customer after it had been damaged in an accident {{on the ground in the}} 1960s. From there, he considerably re-built it as the Aerocar III, replacing the original cabin with a sleeker, more streamlined front wheel drive one (although it still fell far short of the sporty lines that Taylor had originally wanted to give it). The automotive unit weighed 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 140 hp Lycoming O-320. The <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> for the wings in towed configuration were deployable from a compartment on the outside of each wing leading edge. The propeller driveshaft contains fine ball bearings that swing outward with centrifugal force, creating stiffness and dampening. Taylor was able to attract some interest from Ford, but ultimately, no production resulted. The single prototype is now displayed at Seattle's Museum of Flight, where it is displayed wearing registration N100D.|$|R
