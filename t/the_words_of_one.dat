According to the book's authors, {{this is partly}} because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> reviewer, “The play is refreshingly {{illuminating}} on {{the relationship}} between Socrates’ execution and the lasting influence of Aristophanes’ negative depiction of him on the evolution of the Athenian psyche.” According to another, the play not only gives an entertaining portrayal of Plato's famous mentor, but also a fascinating introduction to the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” individual presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater understanding of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|Abaza Hasan's {{promotion}} {{to the major}} governorships of Diyarbakır and Aleppo coincided with another major development in Ottoman history: {{the beginning of the}} Köprülü Era. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha had been given the office of grand vizier on 15 September 1656, and since then began carrying out major reforms of the Ottoman state. Some of these aroused widespread opposition, such as the purges he carried out against the Altı Bölük cavalry regiments (of which Abaza Hasan had once been a member). In particular, after his return to Edirne from the 1657 campaign to reconquer the islands of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Limni (Lemnos), Köprülü Mehmed ordered a massacre of all the cavalry soldiers he suspected of disloyalty - in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> historian, strewing the banks of the Tunca River with corpses. Abaza Hasan already had a history of disloyalty toward Köprülü: In 1657 Köprülü had ordered the execution of the governor of Egypt, and Abaza Hasan secretly aided his escape through Aleppo. Thus, when the order was given for the army to assemble for a campaign against Transylvania, Abaza Hasan and his allies chose not to heed the call. Instead, they gathered at Konya with an army of 30,000, and pledged to oppose Köprülü. Their forces included {{a significant portion of the}} Ottoman military, including the governors of Damascus, Anatolia, Raqqa, and Aleppo, which Abaza Hasan himself governed. The rebels were further supported by members of the imperial cavalry regiments who had fled from Köprülü's purges.|$|E

He was defended by John Philpot Curran, who in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his most famous speeches {{destroyed}} O'Brien's credit.

Notwithstanding his conduct in the case of William Orr, there is little evidence overall that Chamberlain was a political time-server.|$|R
60|$|The second cause, the {{extension}} of trade, has inculcated the same regard for veracity through the pocket. For {{with the increase of}} business transactions in both time and space, the telling of the truth has become a financial necessity. Without it, trade would come to a standstill at once. Our whole mercantile system, a modern piece of mechanism unknown to the East till we imported it thither, turns on an implicit belief in <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> neighbor.

500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.|$|E

500|$|To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks {{developed}} Mickey Mouse, possibly {{inspired by}} a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although {{the origins of the}} character are unclear.

Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate, and Disney provided Mickey's voice until 1947.

This is what has incensed the millions of Indians who are flabbergasted that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest players {{in the history of the}} game, Sachin Tendulkar, was not accepted. In effect, Tendulkar has been branded a liar by the match referee.The off spinner has denied having used <b>the</b> <b>word</b> which has caused offence and in the absence of any audio recording and most crucially with both umpires not having heard it, the charge should have been dropped straight away for lack of corroborating evidence.

500|$|By the 19thcentury, gardens {{were created}} within the castle's enclosure.

5000|$|William Russo's {{approach}} to popularising his Aesop's Fables (1971) {{was to make}} of it a rock opera. This incorporates nine, each only introduced by the narrator before the music and characters take over. Instead <b>of</b> following <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more standard fable collections, as other composers do, the performer speaks in character.

[...] Other composers who have created operas for children have been Martin Kalmanoff in Aesop the fabulous fabulist (1969), David Ahlstom in his one-act Aesop's Fables (1986), and David Edgar Walther with his set of four [...] "short operatic dramas", some of which were performed in 2009 and 2010. There have also been local ballet treatments of the fables for children in the USA by such companies as Berkshire Ballet and Nashville Ballet.|$|R
