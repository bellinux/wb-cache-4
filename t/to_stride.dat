5|$|He {{returned}} to racing against horses {{of his own}} age, starting the 8/15 favourite of a field of ten runners for the six-furlong Middle Park Plate at Newmarket. As the field neared the finish, Orme was travelling the best, {{and as soon as}} Barrett let him go, he immediately took the lead. El Diablo tried to close, but could not get to Orme, with the latter winning easily by a couple of lengths, Gantlet being a neck back from El Diablo in third. Orme then started in the Dewhurst Plate, but his presence deterred many owners from entering and he faced only two rivals. He started as the 6/100 favourite, with El Diablo at 20/1 and Hatfield at 50/1. Orme led from the start, and with two furlongs to run he began <b>to</b> <b>stride</b> away. El Diablo tried to close, but Orme won by three-quarters of a length from him and was never extended. Hatfield finished well behind Orme and El Diablo in third place. Orme's final race of the season came on 30 October in the Home-bred Foal Post Stakes over five furlongs and 140 yards at Newmarket. He started as the 3/100 favourite and faced three rivals. Orme lead throughout the race and won easily by two lengths from Esmond, with Lucellum a further three lengths back in third place.|$|E

On a muddy track, Gun Runner tracked the early leaders then took the lead as the field turned for home. Gun Runner continued <b>to</b> <b>stride</b> out well but succumbed to Arrogate, who had overcome a terrible start to record a dominant win. Gun Runner's second-place finish earned him 2 million dollars. After the Dubai World Cup, his connections announced that Gun Runner would run against Arrogate at least once more, in the 2017 Breeders' Cup Classic.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the data}} not only {{facilitate}} in deciphering the complex phenomena such as heterosis and epigenetics, {{it may also}} enable breeders to predict which fragment of a chromosome is derived from which parent in the progeny line, thereby recognizing crossover events occurring in every progeny line and inserting markers on genetic and physical maps without ambiguity. In due course, this will assist in introducing specific chromosomal segments from one cultivar to another. Besides, the researchers had identified diverse classes of genes participating in energy production, metabolism and growth that were probably linked with crop yield, which can now be utilized {{for the development of}} transgenic wheat. Thus whole genome sequence of wheat and the availability of thousands of SNPs will inevitably permit the breeders <b>to</b> <b>stride</b> towards identifying novel traits, providing biological knowledge and empowering biodiversity-based breeding.|$|E
500|$|The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, {{believed}} that Stride {{had been attacked}} with a swift, sudden action. She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath freshening sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating {{that she had not}} had time to defend herself. A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes <b>to</b> <b>Stride</b> and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious. At the inquest, the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes. They described her stomach contents as [...] "cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [...] ". Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press. Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed. Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache. Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer. However, Lawende stated {{that he would not be}} able to identify the man again, and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions.|$|E

Parallel access <b>to</b> <b>strided</b> vectors on the L 2 cache is a major performance issue on such vector microprocessors. A major difficulty for such a parallel access is that one would like to interleave the cache on a block size basis in order to benefit from spatial locality and to maintain a low tag volume, while strided vector accesses naturally work on a word granularity. In this paper, we address this issue. Considering a parallel vector unit with  ¢...|$|R
