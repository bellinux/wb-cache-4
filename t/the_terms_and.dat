5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organizations: the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände, and the Waffen-SS, {{which was founded in}} 1934 as the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940. The Waffen-SS evolved into a second German army alongside the Wehrmacht and operated in tandem with them, especially with the Heer (German Army). Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not copy <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> ranks used by the Wehrmacht's branches. Instead it used the ranks established by the post-World War I Freikorps and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasize the SS as being independent from the Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden. THSRC signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of 8 domestic banks led by Bank of Taiwan in January, 2010; and utilized the new loan {{to pay off the}} previous syndicated loan which with higher interest.

5|$|Northcott {{headed the}} BCOF from December 1945 until June 1946.

The BCOF would serve under American command, with American policy being followed. Northcott was offered, and accepted, the post of Governor of New South Wales in April 1946. He remained in Japan until June though, because Prime Minister Ben Chifley wanted the changeover to coincide with his own visit to Japan in May, and because he needed to obtain consent of the other governments concerned for the appointment of Lieutenant General Horace Robertson as Northcott's successor. Northcott's lack of experience in command once again showed, and his command was again overhauled by Robertson.|$|E

5|$|An-Nasir Yusuf sent a {{delegation}} to Hulagu afterward, repeating his protestations to submission. Hulagu {{refused to accept}} <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> so an-Nasir Yusuf called on Cairo for aid. This plea coincided with a successful coup by the Cairo-based Mamluks against the remaining symbolic Ayyubid leadership in Egypt, with strongman Qutuz officially taking power. Meanwhile, an Ayyubid army was assembled at Birzeh, just north of Damascus to defend the city against the Mongols who were now marching towards northern Syria. Aleppo was soon besieged within a week and in January 1260 it fell to the Mongols. The Great Mosque and the Citadel of Aleppo were razed {{and most of the}} inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery. The destruction of Aleppo caused panic in Muslim Syria; The Ayyubid emir of Homs, al-Ashraf Musa, offered to ally with Mongols at the approach of their army and was allowed to continue governance of the city by Hulagu. Hama also capitulated without resisting, but did not join forces with the Mongols. An-Nasir Yusuf opted to flee Damascus to seek protection in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} that by <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> {{spirit of the}} statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The remedy for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Hungry Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. One of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> {{conditions of the}} renewed agreement required Hungry Jack's to open a minimum number of new locations each year {{for the duration of}} the contract. Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack's locations to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack's of violating the conditions of the renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Primus {{returned}} to Charlton Athletic on a loan deal, however the deal almost collapsed as negotiations broke down between Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and Charlton manager Alan Pardew. Pardew wanted the centre half {{for the whole}} of the 2008–09 season, but Redknapp was only happy to loan him out until Christmas of 2008 to gain match fitness, and it appeared the deal would be called off by Portsmouth. Finally Charlton agreed to <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> Primus move to the Valley on a three-month loan days before the transfer window closed. He scored his first goal for Charlton in a 5–2 home defeat to Sheffield United. The result ultimately led to the sacking of manager Alan Pardew. He played 10 matches for the Championship (new name for Division One) club before returning to Portsmouth {{for the rest of the}} 2008–09 season. He was due to play in a crucial match against Derby County, however the match was postponed by Sky until after the expiration of his loan; much to the anger of Charlton. Primus' loan had to be rearranged and a deal was agreed by both clubs for the loan to expire after the match against Derby.|$|E
5|$|When Salten {{originally}} published Bambi in 1923, {{he did so}} under Germany's copyright laws, which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney {{for the creation of}} a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> validity of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name.|$|E
