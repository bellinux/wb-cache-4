50|$|The {{ignition}} timing {{will need to}} become increasingly advanced (relative to TDC) as the engine speed increases so that the air-fuel mixture has the correct {{amount of time to}} fully burn. As the engine speed (RPM) increases, the time available to burn the mixture decreases but the burning itself proceeds at the same speed, it needs to be started increasingly earlier to complete in time. Poor volumetric efficiency at higher engine speeds also requires increased advancement of {{ignition timing}}. The correct timing advance for a given engine speed will allow for maximum cylinder pressure to be achieved at the correct crankshaft angular position. When setting the timing for an automobile engine, the factory <b>timing</b> <b>setting</b> can usually be found on a sticker in the engine bay.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The charge burn {{characteristics}} of a four-cylinder port-fuel-injected spark ignition engine fitted with a dual independent variable-valve-timing system have been investigated experimentally. The influence of valve timings on the flame development angle and the rapid burn angle is primarily associated with valve overlap values and internal gas recirculation. Conditions examined cover light to medium loads and engine speeds up to 3500 r/min. As engine loads and speeds exceeded about 6 bar net indicated mean effective pressure and 3000 r/min respectively, combustion duration was virtually independent of the valve <b>timing</b> <b>setting.</b> At lower speeds and work output conditions, valve timing influenced burn angles through changes in dilution mass fraction, charge density, and charge temperature. Of these, changes in dilution mass fraction had the greatest influence. Increasing the dilution by increasing the valve overlap produced an increase in both burn angles. The effects of mean piston speed and spark timing have also been examined, and empirical expressions for the flame development and the rapid burn angles are presented...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) {{applications}} require {{traffic signal}} control data which is typically {{difficult to obtain}} and cumbersome to code in the required format. In addition, the evaluation of future scenarios requires future traffic signal settings consistent with the forecasted demand. These future signal settings are not known a priori and are costly to estimate. Intuitively, the future signal timings need to be reasonably optimized so as to represent what the traffic management agency will do. In literature, integration between traffic control and DTA models has been formulated as a bi-level or single-level optimization problem with system or user optimal constraints. Most existing solution procedures require certain “nested” structure with an inner loop algorithm solving the user equilibrium or system optimal assignment problem and the outer loop algorithm searching for the optimal signal <b>timing</b> <b>setting.</b> Most of these solution approaches remain only research tools without practical use due to computational intractability. This research proposes an efficient solution algorithm to the problem. An adaptive traffic signal control model is embedded in a simulation-based DTA model. For each inbound approach at an intersection of interest, the adaptive model uses upstream information and a dynamic rolling horizon approach to project traffic flow conditions for a dynamic but {{short period of time}} (projection period). The adaptive model provides the signal settings during the entire traffic flow simulation process and for every iteration of the solution algorithm. Thus, during the entire solution process, the experienced travel times and the resulting traffic assignment flows are based on the adaptive (demand responsive) signal settings. Thereby, the DTA flows and the adaptive signal settings are generated simultaneously in a single-loop algorithmic structure. Simulation experiments illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Lead in petrol {{has been}} {{identified}} as a health hazard and attempts are being made to create a lead-free atmosphere. Through an intensive study a review is made of the various options available to the automobile and petroleum industry. The economic and atmospheric penalties coupled with automobile fuel consumption trends are calculated and presented in both graphical and tabulated form. Experimental measurements of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are also presented for certain selected fuels. Reduction in CO and HC's with the employment of a three-way catalyst is also discussed. All tests were carried out on a Fiat 127 A engine at wide open throttle and standard <b>timing</b> <b>setting.</b> A Froude dynamometer was used to vary engine speed. With the introduction of lead-free petrol, interest in combustion chamber deposits in spark ignition engines has ben renewed. These deposits cause octane requirement increase or rise in engine knock and decreased volumetric efficiency. The detrimental effect of the deposits has been attributed to the physical volume of the deposit and to changes in heat transfer. This study attempts to assess why leaded deposits, though often greater in mass and volume, yield relatively lower ORI when compared to lead-free deposits under identical operating conditions. This has been carried out by identifying the differences in the physical nature of the deposit and then through measurement of the thermal conductivity and permeability of the deposits. The measured thermal conductivity results are later used in a mathematical model to determine heat transfer rates and temperature variation across the engine wall and deposit. For the model, the walls of the combustion cylinder and top are assumed to be free of engine deposit, the major deposit being on the piston head. Seven different heat transfer equations are formulated describing heat flow at each part of the four stroke cycle, and the variation of cylinder wall area exposed to gas mixture is accounted for. The heat transfer equations are solved using numerical methods and temperature variations across the wall identified. Though the calculations have been carried out for one particular moment in the cycle, similar calculations are possible for every degree of the crank angle, and thus further information regarding location of maximum temperatures at every degree of the crank angle may also be determined. In conclusion, thermal conductivity values of leaded and lead-free deposits have been found. The fundamental concepts of a mathematical model with great potential have been formulated and it is hoped that with future work it may be used in a simulation for different engine construction materials and motor fuels, leading to better design of future prototype engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of oxygenated hydrocarbons on the knocking characteristics of an engine when blended with low-leaded gasoline. Alcohols, ethers, esters and ketones were tested individually and in various combinations up to an oxygen content of 4 % wt/wt in a blend with Series F- 7 gasoline of 90, 92, 94 and 96 RON. Tests were carried out at wide open throttle, constant speed and standard <b>timing</b> <b>setting.</b> Engine speed was varied using a dynamometer and knock was detected by two piezoelectric transducers, one on the cylinder head monitoring all four cylinders and one monitoring the cylinder most prone to knock. The engine speeds associated with trace and light knock of a continuous nature were noted. Curves were produced for each oxygenate blend of base RON used against engine speed for the two knock conditions which were compared with those produced using pure Series F- 7 fuels. From this a suggested RON of the blend was derived. RON increase was less when using a higher RON base fuel in the blend. Most individual oxygenates showed similar effects in similar concentrations when their oxygen content was comparable. Blends containing more than one oxygenate showed some variation with methanol/MTBE/ 3 methylbutan- 2 -one and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one knocking less than expected and methanol/MTBE/TBA also showing good knock resistance. Further tests to optimise initial findings suggested a blend of methanol and MTBE to be superior although partial replacement of MTBE by 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one resulted in a fuel of comparable performance. Exhaust emissions were tested for a number of oxygenated blends in 2 -star gasoline. 2 -star and 4 -star fuels were also tested for reference. All oxygenate blends reduced carbon monoxide emissions as expected and hydrocarbon emissions were also reduced. The largest reduction in carbon monoxide occurred using a 14. 5 % (1 : 1 : 1) methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one blend. Hydrocarbon emissions were most markedly reduced by a blend containing 25. 5 % 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one. Power output was tested for the blends and indicated a maximum increase of about 5 % at low engine speeds. The most advantageous blends were methanol/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 5) 11 % in 2 -star and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 3 : 2) 11 % in 2 -star. In conclusion methanol/MTBE (6 : 5) and (5 : 5), and various combinations of methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one, notably (6 : 3 : 2) gave good results in all tests conducted. CFR testing of these blends showed them to increase both RON and MON substantially...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tinnitus is {{associated}} with depression and anxiety disor- ders, severely and adversely affecting {{the quality of life}} and functional health status for some people. With the dearth of clinical psychologists embedded in audiology services and the cessation of training for hearing therapists in the UK, it is left to audiologists to meet the psychological needs of many patients with tinnitus. However, there is no universally standardized training or manualized intervention specifically for audiolo- gists across the whole UK public healthcare system and similar systems elsewhere across the world. Objectives: The primary aim of this scoping review was to catalog the components of psychological therapies for people with tinnitus, which have been used or tested by psychologists, so that they might inform the development of a standardized audiologist-delivered psy- chological intervention. Secondary aims of this article were to identify the types of psychological therapy for people with tinnitus, who were reported but not tested in any clinical trial, as well as the job roles of clinicians who delivered psychological therapy for people with tinnitus in the literature. Design: The authors searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; ISRCTN; ClinicalTrials. gov; IC-TRP; and Google Scholar. In addition, the authors searched the gray literature including conference abstracts, disserta- tions, and editorials. No records were excluded on the basis of controls used, outcomes reached, <b>timing,</b> <b>setting,</b> or study design (except for reviews—of the search results. Records were included in which a psy- chological therapy intervention was reported to address adults (≤ 18 years) tinnitus-related distress. No restrictive criteria were placed upon the term tinnitus. Records were excluded in which the intervention included biofeedback, habituation, hypnosis, or relaxation as necessary parts of the treatment. Results: A total of 5043 records were retrieved of which 64 were retained. Twenty-five themes of components that have been included within a psychological therapy were identified, including tinnitus educa- tion, psychoeducation, evaluation treatment rationale, treatment plan- ning, problem-solving behavioral intervention, thought identification, thought challenging, worry time, emotions, social comparison, inter- personal skills, self-concept, lifestyle advice, acceptance and defusion, mindfulness, attention, relaxation, sleep, sound enrichment, comorbid- ity, treatment reflection, relapse prevention, and common therapeutic skills. The most frequently reported psychological therapies were cogni- tive behavioral therapy, tinnitus education, and internet-delivered cogni- tive behavioral therapy. No records reported that an audiologist delivered any of these psychological therapies {{in the context of an}} empirical trial in which their role was clearly delineated from that of other clinicians. Conclusions: Scoping review methodology does not attempt to appraise the quality of evidence or synthesize the included records. Further research should therefore determine the relative importance of these dif- ferent components of psychological therapies from the perspective of the patient and the clinician...|$|E

Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow.

40|$|The {{relation}} between reinforcer magnitude and timing behavior was studied using a peak procedure. Four rats received multiple consecutive sessions with both {{low and high}} levels of brain stimulation reward (BSR). Rats paused longer and had later start times during sessions when their responses were reinforced with low-magnitude BSR. When estimated by a symmetric Gaussian function, peak times also were earlier; when estimated by a better-fitting asymmetric Gaussian function or by analyzing individual trials, however, these peak-time changes were determined to reflect a mixture of large effects of BSR on start times and no effect on stop times. These results pose a significant dilemma for three major theories of <b>timing</b> (<b>SET,</b> MTS, and BeT), which all predict no effects for chronic manipulations of reinforcer magnitude. We conclude that increased reinforcer magnitude influences timing in two ways: through larger immediate after-effects that delay responding and through anticipatory effects that elicit earlier responding...|$|R
