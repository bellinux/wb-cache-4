5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> a set {{can be placed}} into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even.

5|$|In this way, {{detached}} objects differ substantially {{from most}} other known TNOs, which form a loosely defined set of populations {{that have been}} perturbed to varying degrees onto their current orbit by gravitational encounters with the giant planets, predominantly Neptune. Detached objects have larger perihelia than these other TNO populations, including <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> orbital resonance with Neptune, such as Pluto, the classical Kuiper belt objects in non-resonant orbits such as Makemake, and the scattered disk objects like Eris.|$|E
40|$|Children {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{are reported to}} have difficulty in learning novel word–object associations in case of discrepancy between <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus and their focus (the discrepant condition). Two eye-tracking experiments investigated this difficulty by controlling and recording children's gaze fixation. In Experiment 1 's discrepant condition, typically developing (TD) children (age: 6 – 11 years) mapped the novel word to <b>the</b> novel <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus more frequently than children with ASD (age: 6 – 11 years). Additionally, the former looked at <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus longer than <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> their own focus, while the latter looked at these <b>objects</b> for <b>the</b> same duration. In Experiment 2, the saliency of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus was enhanced and children with ASD (age: 6 – 12 years) mapped the word to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus as well as TD children (age: 6 – 12 years). Moreover, they looked at <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus longer than <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> their focus. Comparison between experiments also confirmed improvement in performance, suggesting that the duration of gaze at an <b>object</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speaker's focus is related to difficulty in referential word learning in children with ASD...|$|R

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E

25|$|The post-Darwinian {{approach}} to the naming of periods in earth history focused at first on the lapse of time: early (Palaeo-), middle (Meso-) and late (Ceno-). This conceptualization automatically imposes a three-age subdivision to any period, which is predominant in modern archaeology: Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age; Early, Middle and Late Minoan, etc. The criterion is whether <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> question look simple or are elaborative. If a horizon contains objects that are post-late and simpler-than-late they are sub-, as in Submycenaean.|$|E
25|$|The ideograms are symbols, not {{pictures}} of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> question—e.g. one tablet records a tripod with missing legs, but the ideogram used is of a tripod with three legs.

Ventris and Chadwick generally used English; Bennett, Latin. Neither the English nor the Latin can {{be relied upon}} as an accurate name of the object; in fact, the identification {{of some of the}} more obscure objects is a matter of exegesis.|$|E
25|$|Invariance is the {{property}} of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; {{as well as several}} other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features.

They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in C, and when depicted using different graphic elements as in D.
