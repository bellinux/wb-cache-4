Businessman Claus Spreckels was {{willing to make the}} arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E
25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time {{and the opportunity to}} organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E
25|$|Samasyā (Hindi: समस्या, meaning Difficulty): This canto, a soliloquy by Aṣṭāvakra in his mother's womb, {{deals with}} the notion of Samasyā or a difficulty. The canto is replete with pathos (Karuṇa Rasa), heroism (Vīra Rasa) and optimism. In the first 30 verses, various metaphors are painted for difficulty, which is {{universal}} and extremely powerful. Faith in God and determined action are the ways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difficulty, and Aṣṭāvakra is resolute that he will get out of his predicament too. In verses 61 to 82, the real nature of the Ātman (Self), without beginning and end, without birth and death, and beyond mortal difficulties is presented, according to the poet's philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita. Aṣṭāvakra then tells Kahola about his (Kahola's) imminent repentance, and that he is determined intent to live the life of a disabled. He requests his father not to curse anybody in future, and the canto ends with optimistic prophesies by Aṣṭāvakra that the curse of his father is a blessing in disguise for the disabled of the world, as Aṣṭāvakra will be their role model.|$|E

500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You listen to , and it's like a blind man struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization of {{all of the things that}} I had discovered in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|E

Roger and Jane go to the party, which is hosted by Jane's therapist and her husband. After dinner, Roger asks Jane if they can leave, but Jane reminds Roger that he agreed to take LSD with the group and begs him to stay, as she doesn't want to go through the experience alone. Roger is initially unimpressed with the drug but comes around after his consciousness begins to change with vivid audio-visual hallucinations. Roger and Jane return home via taxi and take a bath together, during which Roger imagines he is watching the 1919 World Series from the bathtub. The couple then talks candidly about their marriage for the first time. During this moment of awareness, Jane admits that she knows the marriage is over. The next morning, a jovial Roger says goodbye to a shocked Jane, who appears regretful about what she said the night before.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have {{stressed}} Lincoln's redefinition of republican values. As {{early as the}} 1850s, {{a time when most}} political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the [...] "sheet anchor" [...] of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, [...] "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." [...] His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.|$|E

It would also address their 1998 breakup and their subsequent reunion. SWV Reunited premiered on January 16, 2014 with a six episode season. A twelve episode second season followed later that August. As promised, the show has documented the trust issues the groupmates have with one another from their acrimonious split and their attempt to rebuild their friendships and their brand. It also showcased their professional endeavors and struggles, including touring and recording a comeback album, trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> record contract and disputes with their road manager, Cory Taylor. Subplots included Coko's reluctance to record secular music after her foray into gospel, Taj's health issues and Lelee's tumultuous relationship with her daughter. A song that the group was shown recording on SWV Reunited entitled [...] "Ain't No Man" [...] was released to iTunes as a promo single on August 7, 2015.|$|E
