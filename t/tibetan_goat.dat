40|$|The 10 {{microsatellite}} markers (XBM 7, XBM 11, XBM 16, XBM 19, XBM 24, XBM 31, XBM 84, TGLA 53, SRCRSP- 10 and ILS 005) {{were selected}} to investigate the genetic diversity of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>goat</b> of Plateau type (NM, n= 108), and the other 5 goat populations, i. e., <b>Tibetan</b> <b>goat</b> of Valley type (TG, n= 36), Baiyu black goat (BY, n= 36), Jianchang black goat (JC, n= 36), Meigu goat (MG, n= 36) and Xinjiang goat (XJ, n= 32) were served as control. The mean polymorphism information content, heterozygosity and effective allele number of these 6 populations were 0. 660 / 0. 777 / 4. 476, 0. 716 / 0. 797 / 4. 9416, 0. 631 / 0. 673 / 3. 061, 0. 649 / 0. 680 / 3. 125, 0. 629 / 0. 680 / 3. 125 and 0. 561 / 0. 793 / 4. 840 respectively. The allele frequencies of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>goat</b> of plateau type in 10 microsatellite loci were greatly different with other 5 goat populations. The 6 goat populations were grouped into three distinct clusters: the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>goat</b> cluster (NM goat and TG goat), Sichuan goat cluster (JC goat, MG goat and BY goat), and Xinjiang goat cluster (XJ goat). These 3 distinct clusters were finally clustered together. The genetic differences among populations {{were in accordance with}} their geographical and historical origins...|$|E
40|$|Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding {{glycoprotein}} {{found in}} exocrine secretions including milk. High levels of lactoferrin {{may have a}} role in the prevention of microbial infection of the mammary gland. In this report we sequenced and characterized goat lactoferrin cDNA and its promoter region in two different breeds of goat. The complete cDNA comprised 2356 nucleotides, including 38 bp at the 5 '-UTR and 194 bp at the 3 '-UTR. The open reading frame is 2127 bp long and it encodes a mature protein of 689 aminoacids. A total of 19 nucleotide differences, 11 of them being responsible for 8 aminoacid changes, were identified through the comparison with French, Korean and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>goat</b> lactoferrin cDNAs. About 1700 bp of the lactoferrin gene promoter were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed a non-canonical TATA box, multiple SP 1 /GC elements, and other putative binding sites for transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, STAT 3 and AP 2. Two SNPs were identified, one of which would seem to create a new putative AP 2 consensus sequence. The presence of an additional AP 2 binding site could be associated with quantitative differences of such protein fraction, which could enhance all the activities related to such protein, and improve mammary gland defence against bacterial infections...|$|E

40|$|Most {{cashmere}} goats {{are found}} in northern China and Mongolia. They are regarded as precious resources for their production of high quality natural fibre for the textile industry. It {{was the first time}} that the genetic diversity and population structure of nine Chinese cashmere populations has been assessed using 14 ISAG/FAO microsatellite markers. In addition, two Iranian populations and one West African goat population were genotyped for comparison. Results indicated that the genetic diversity of Chinese cashmere goats was rich, but less than those of the Iranian goat populations. All pairwise FST values between the Chinese cashmere goat populations reached a highly significant level (P < 0. 001), suggesting that they should all be considered as separate breeds. Finally, clustering analysis divided Chinese cashmere goats into at least two clusters, with the <b>Tibetan</b> Hegu <b>goats</b> alone in one cluster. An extensive admixture was detected among the Chinese goat breeds (except the Hegu), which have important implications for breeding management...|$|R
5000|$|Oral sex: Several species {{engage in}} both autofellatio and oral sex. This has been {{documented}} in brown bears, <b>Tibetan</b> macaques, wolves, <b>goats,</b> primates, hyenas, bats, cape ground squirrels and sheep. In the greater short-nosed fruit bat, copulation by males is dorsoventral and the females lick the shaft or {{the base of the}} male's penis, but not the glans which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, POU 1 F 1 gene {{polymorphism}} was detected in five sheep populations (large-tailed Han, small-tailed Han, Yuxi fat-tailed, Lanzhou large-tailed, and Mongolian sheep), using DNA pooling and sequencing, to provide theoretical {{basis for the}} breeding of excellent sheep varieties. Three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci of POU 1 F 1 gene were detected in five sheep populations, namely C 355 T (C/T), C 71 G (C/G), and C 330 G (C/G). C and T frequencies of C 355 T were 0. 67 / 0. 33, 0. 81 / 0. 19, 0. 67 / 0. 33, 1. 00 / 0. 00, and 0. 93 / 0. 07, respectively, in large-tailed Han, small-tailed Han, Yuxi fat-tailed, Mongolian, and Lanzhou large-tailed sheep. C of C 355 T locus was the dominant allele in five sheep populations. C and G allele frequencies of C 330 G locus were detected in Yuxi fat-tailed sheep; their frequencies were 0. 75 and 0. 25, respectively. C and G allele of C 71 G locus were only detected in Yuxi fat-tailed and large-tailed Han sheep; their frequencies were 0. 87 / 0. 13 and 0. 87 / 0. 13, respectively. The cluster analysis based on POU 1 F 1 gene sequence showed that bactrian camel, dromedary, and wild camel clustered first, and dolphin and killer whales clustered according to taxonomy. Although the four species <b>Tibetan</b> antelope, buffalo, <b>goat,</b> and sheep were alone, they got close and the relative genetic relationship was intimate according to the dendrogram. The mutation site analysis of the POU 1 F 1 gene in five sheep populations in this study would be favorable for uncovering the function of POU 1 F 1 gene deeply...|$|R
5000|$|William-Louis Ternaux (1763-1833), {{the eldest}} son of Charles-Louis Ternaux (1738-1814), took over the {{direction}} of his family’s small woolen cloth business at Sedan (Department of Ardennes) in 1781 and rose to become the leading woolens manufacturer in France under Napoleon and during the Restoration. At the height of his success and fame in 1823, he challenged anyone to provide evidence to the contrary. If anyone, he wrote, could prove “... the existence of a manufacturer, not only in France, but in Europe, who has, at the same time, manufactured a greater amount and a greater value of woolen stuffs, created more new stuffs, experimented more with the use of raw materials and with the texture of fabrics, added more to the value of common woolen cloths, than I have done {{in the course of my}} life, I stand ready to pay this researcher the sum of 100,000 francs for his efforts.” [...] Ternaux was indeed one of the great ‘lanceurs d’affaires’ of the early Industrial Revolution in France. During 1781-1789 he very capably expanded the family woolens business at Sedan from 8 to 150 looms, giving work to over 3,000 men, women and children. The politics of the Revolution interrupted his achievement and led to his exile from France during 1792-98, but he used these years to advantage by studying the woolens industry in England, Germany and Switzerland. He formulated an ambitious business plan for when he would return to France. By the time of the [...] "Exposition of the Products of French Industry" [...] in Paris in 1823, when he composed his daring challenge cited above, he had created and was orchestrating a giant mechanized woolens industry employing overall some 20,000 people. Every requirement, from the raising of sheep to the marketing of finished products, was provided for and integrated. His main factories (usines de fabrication) at Sedan, Reims, Louviers and Verviers (Belgium) employed a total of about 800 looms. He had experimental model factories for new fabrics (ateliers d’essais) at his summer estate at Saint-Ouen, near Paris. In Paris, there were workshops on the rue Mouffetard for constructing and testing new textiles machines and a chain of ten retail shops for displaying his wares, the most important of which was the Cachemire Français at No.3 Place des Victoires. His main offices and private bank were at the same address. He built a dyeworks at Ternes and a Spanish-style wool washing plant at Auteuil. He had commerce houses in cities throughout Europe as well as in New York, Mexico, Valparaiso and Calcutta. His ship, named Ternaux’, carried his goods to ports around the world. Ternaux contributed significantly to the introduction and perfection of merino sheep from Spain and, most famously, in 1818-19 he brought <b>Tibetan</b> cashmere <b>goats</b> to France and experimented with their fine down for his famous luxury shawls (cachemires, also named Ternauxs). His private herd of about 150 goats at Saint-Ouen supplied the fine wool for his factories at Reims that specialized in high quality fabrics -- [...] "étoffes de goût et de fantasie en laine." ...|$|R
