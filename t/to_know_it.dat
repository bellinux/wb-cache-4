25|$|The Greek {{belief of}} ideal forms was later {{extended}} by Plato in his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai:ideas). The Greek word idea (ιδέα:idea) {{has the same}} roots with the words idein (ιδείν:to see), eidos (είδος:species), and probably with oida (οίδα:know), therefore one must see something in order <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Originally, the words were applied to such obvious forms as the human body. The transference of the words from visible to invisible show how the Greek mind moved from the gift of senses to the principles behind them which were also used {{in the art of}} sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} equations {{are written}} {{primarily for the}} generic trajectory of a packet of flow travelling on a horizontal plane and taken at a certain elapsed time called t. The position of the packet {{is defined by the}} distance on the trajectory s=s(t) which it has travelled by time t. In reality, however, the trajectory is the outcome of the balance of forces upon the particle. In this section we assume <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> from the start for convenience of representation. When we consider the motion determined by the forces selected next, we will have clues of which type of trajectory fits the particular balance of forces.|$|E

500|$|Ralph P. Locke, in {{his study}} of Carmen's origins, draws {{attention}} to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his History of Western Music, praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: [...] "Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head." [...] Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> by heart; [...] "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique.|$|E

[...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E

[...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the right}} to the {{communication}} of the truth is not unconditional in Catholic teaching. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. In concrete situations one should judge whether {{it is appropriate to}} reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it.

2500|$|Students who are {{introduced}} to factoring as a primary method of solving quadratic equations might be surprised <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{is one of the}} newest methods of solving them. Vera Sanford points out in her A Short History of Mathematics (1930) that “In view of the present emphasis given to the solution of quadratic equations by factoring, {{it is interesting to note}} that this method was not used until Harriot’s work of 1631. Even in this case, however, the author ignores the factors that give rise to negative roots.” Harriot died in 1621, and like all his books, this one, Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas, was published after his death. An article on Harriot at the Univ of Saint Andrews math history web site says that in his personal writing on solving equations Harriot did use both positive and negative solutions, but his editor, Walter Warner, did not present this in his book. Harriot’s method of factoring may look different than what modern students expect. [...] In the first section (Sectio Prima) Harriot draws tables to illustrate the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of monomial, binomial, and trinomial terms. [...] Then in the second section he shows a more direct multiplication that provides the foundation to his factoring method. He sets up the equation , and shows that this matches the form of multiplication he has previously provided as, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
