He concludes {{that it must be}} Veld, and removes him from command, instead placing the company's security leader Heidegger in charge. In his first operation however, Heidegger nearly destroys Junon, and the President reinstates Veld. In his first mission back in command, Veld plans to defeat AVALANCHE. An assault is launched at a Mako Reactor, during which Rufus Shinra is revealed to be the traitor supporting AVALANCHE. He is captured by <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> and placed under house arrest. At the same time, Shears defects to <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> in an effort to save the gravely ill Elfé. Veld discovers that Elfé is his daughter Felicia, whom he thought dead in a botched Shinra operation, and resigns from <b>the</b> <b>Turks.</b> With Elfé continuing to weaken, Fuhito takes over the command of AVALANCHE. It is revealed that a Materia owned by Elfé is Zirconiade, an ancient and powerful summoned monster that Fuhito intends to use to destroy humanity and stop them harming the planet. However, the Materia is broken, and is slowly draining Elfé's life energy. To save her, the four Support Materia must be found.

5|$|All {{along the}} ANZAC perimeter, Turkish troops {{continued}} trying to advance using fire and manoeuvre. This gradually petered {{out as the}} morning progressed, and <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> tried to regain their own lines instead. The Australians and New Zealanders continued to fire on them, sometimes showing themselves above their trenches. <b>The</b> <b>Turks</b> were now able to return fire, which caused {{the majority of the}} ANZAC casualties. It was now clear to the Australians and New Zealanders that the Turkish attack was a failure. However, a report arrived at Turkish headquarters suggesting that some objectives had been captured. So the Turkish commanders issued orders, at 05:00, for a second assault, this time to be supported by an artillery bombardment. Over the next few hours several new attacks began. At 05:25 the 2nd and 5th Divisions attacked again, but instead of moving directly at the Australian lines, they advanced at an angle, and were again mown down. At No.1 Post in the No.4 Section the Canterbury Mounted Rifles observed <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> forming in Malone's Gully, in preparation for another assault on Russell's Top. The location of the post was such that they could turn their machine-gun and engage <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> from the rear, which broke up the attack. <b>The</b> <b>Turks</b> attacked Quinn's four more times, and on one occasion an officer and around thirty men managed to reach the junction of Courtney's and Quinn's before being killed. This pattern of attack was kept up until around 10:00, when Allied observers reported a reluctance among the Turkish troops to leave their trenches.|$|E

5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now <b>the</b> <b>Turks,</b> from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by <b>the</b> <b>Turks.</b> The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage <b>the</b> <b>Turks.</b> This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. <b>The</b> <b>Turks</b> did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E

500|$|The {{interior}} {{also contained}} a pegboard chess board {{connected to a}} pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> over <b>the</b> chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the director to move <b>the</b> <b>Turk's</b> arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close <b>the</b> <b>Turk's</b> hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the director by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following <b>the</b> <b>Turk's</b> acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say [...] "Échec!" [...] (French for [...] "check") during matches.|$|R

While he was hiding inside <b>the</b> <b>Turk,</b> due to <b>the</b> flu, he was seized by coughing and the sound was perceived by the spectators, creating a certain embarrassment to Mälzel (<b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> owner). For this reason, Mälzel, subsequently, added some noisy gears to <b>the</b> <b>Turk,</b> which had no other purpose but to cover any noise that could come from {{the operator}}.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive blow back at <b>the</b> <b>Turks,</b> this time hiring Catalan mercenaries.

Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek.

Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> managed to get behind them.

5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace to play <b>the</b> <b>Turk.</b> According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took {{responsibility for the}} construction of the machine while preparing the game, and <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into <b>the</b> <b>Turk's</b> area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> to make <b>the</b> first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing <b>the</b> move, <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> returned <b>the</b> piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|R

5|$|John {{was then}} able to {{concentrate}} on Asia Minor, which {{became the focus of}} his attention for most of his reign. <b>The</b> <b>Turks</b> were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier, and John was determined to drive them back. Thanks to John's energetic campaigning, Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted, and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy. In order to restore the region to Byzantine control, John led a series of campaigns against <b>the</b> <b>Turks,</b> one of which resulted in the reconquest of the ancestral home of the Komneni at Kastamonu. He quickly earned a formidable reputation as a wall-breaker, taking stronghold after stronghold from his enemies. Regions which had been lost to the empire since Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned. Yet resistance, particularly from the Danishmends of the north-east, was strong, and the difficult nature of holding down the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> whilst John was back in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule. John persevered, and Kastamonu soon changed hands once more. He advanced into north-eastern Anatolia, provoking <b>the</b> <b>Turks</b> to attack his army. Unlike Romanos Diogenes, John's forces were able to maintain their cohesion, and the Turkish attempt to inflict a second Manzikert on the emperor's army backfired when the Sultan, discredited by his failure, was murdered by his own people.|$|E

40|$|The Turk" is a {{multifaceted}} concept {{that emerged in}} the late Middle Ages in Europe, and has gained new faces over the course of time until today. Being primarily a Muslim, <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> usually connoted <b>the</b> antichrist, infidel, and the ultimate enemy. With such attributed qualities, the concept influenced European art and literature by providing a subject with negative visual and textual representations. Current scholarly corpus about representations of <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> sufficiently investigates <b>the</b> subject, yet, without offering different reading and conclusion. This paper aims at introducing a new perspective to the image of <b>the</b> <b>Turk</b> by shedding light on its representations in early modern European board games and playing cards; thus, contributing to a nouvelle scholarly interest on the image of <b>the</b> <b>Turk.</b> It argues that, belonging to a familiar but relatively obscure world of games, board games and playing cards have the potential to reinforce an antithesis to the negative image of <b>the</b> <b>Turk...</b>|$|R
