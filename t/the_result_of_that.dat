25|$|Although González and Eimer {{are both}} {{credited}} as authors, literary historians typically consider González the novel's primary creative force. In 1930, she earned her M.A. in {{history from the}} University of Texas at Austin, where she knew and was encouraged to write about her Mexican-American heritage by folklorist J. Frank Dobie. After her graduation, González moved to San Antonio, Texas to teach Spanish. However, in 1934, under Dobie's supervision, she received a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation that commissioned her to research and write a book on South Texas history.

25|$|Spot-fixing {{attempts}} to defraud bookmakers by a player taking a pre-arranged action to fix <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> specific event. Spot-fixing differs from match fixing, {{in which the}} final result of a match is fixed; or point shaving, in which corrupt players (or officials) attempt to limit the margin of victory of the favoured team. Spot-fixing {{is more difficult to}} detect than match fixing or point shaving, and by its nature can be perpetrated by a lone fraudulent player without needing any other players or officials to co-operate. The growth of internet gambling and increased variety of betting options (e.g. spread betting, first-scorer betting) resulted in the emergence of spot-fixing, particularly through {{the first decade of the}} 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Leopold de Rothschild, whose {{principal}} country residence was Gunnersbury Park, used Ascott {{at first}} as a hunting box, but realising the limitations imposed by its modest size, in 1874 he employed the architect George Devey to enlarge it.

Devey attempted to design a house that rambled {{as though it had}} grown and developed over centuries. The project became a lifetime work for Devey as the house was continually expanded during the remainder of the 19th century. The rambling and climbing shrubs he had planted as part of the design of the facades that Mary Gladstone described in her memoirs are no longer there.|$|E

25|$|Bulbous domes bulge {{out beyond}} their base diameters, {{offering}} a profile greater than a hemisphere. An onion dome {{is a greater}} than hemispherical dome with a pointed top in an ogee profile. They {{are found in the}} Near East, Middle East, Persia, and India and may not have had a single point of origin. Their appearance in northern Russian architecture predates the Tatar occupation of Russia and so is not easily explained as <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> influence. They became popular {{in the second half of}} the 15th century in the Low Countries of Northern Europe, possibly inspired by the finials of minarets in Egypt and Syria, and developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Netherlands before spreading to Germany, becoming a popular element of the baroque architecture of Central Europe. German bulbous domes were also influenced by Russian and Eastern European domes. The examples found in various European architectural styles are typically wooden. Examples include Kazan Church in Kolomenskoye and the Brighton Pavilion by John Nash. In Islamic architecture, they are typically made of masonry, rather than timber, with the thick and heavy bulging portion serving to buttress against the tendency of masonry domes to spread at their bases. The Taj Mahal is a famous example.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the flags, Wrigley authorized Bill Veeck, {{the leader of the}} bleacher reconstruction project, to add colored lights on the crossbar of the masthead so that the Chicago 'L' passengers would {{be able to see the}} outcome of Cubs home games after sunset.

Hartell's book acknowledges Veeck's comments, but reports that contemporary newspapers stated that the colors of the lights were blue and white, as they are now. Eventually the original lights on the masthead were replaced by lights directly on the top of scoreboard, still visible from outside Wrigley field.

500|$|Before Russia {{defeated}} the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74, the Khanate, populated largely by Crimean Tatars, {{had been part}} of the Ottoman Empire. In the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which was <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> war, the Ottoman Empire was forced to cede sovereignty over the Khanate, and allow it to become an independent state under Russian influence. Tatars in Crimea had no desire for independence, and held a strong emotional attachment to the Ottoman Empire. Within two months of the signing of the treaty, the government of the Khanate sent envoys to the Ottomans, asking them to [...] "destroy the conditions of independence". The envoys said that as Russian troops remained stationed in Crimea at Yeni-Kale and Kerch, the Khanate could not be considered independent. Nevertheless, the Ottomans ignored this request, not wishing to violate the agreement with Russia. In the disorder that followed the Turkish defeat, Tatar leader Devlet Giray refused to accept the treaty at the time of its signing. Having been fighting Russians in the Kuban during the war, he crossed the Kerch Strait to Crimea and seized the city of Kaffa (modern Feodosia). Devlet subsequently seized the Crimean throne, usurping Sahib Giray. Despite his actions against the Russians, Russian Empress Catherine the Great recognised Devlet as Khan.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.

[...] He added: [...] "t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response."

Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, in The Mix Review, an {{analyzing}} commercial productions, Mike Senior of Sound on Sound revisited {{the original}} mixing of the song. According to him, {{before he started}} the mix, Senior played the song {{a couple of times}} before releasing what thing about it [...] "bugged" [...] him. Working it out, he noted that the harmony of the mix is undermined by the kick drum. [...] "What's My Name?" [...] contains basic harmonies that are a bar of F# minor, a bar of A major and two bars of D-major. Senior stated that on the other side however, there's a very little in the arrangement that could be seen like a traditional melodic bass-line. As <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> the [...] "808-style" [...] kick-drum's pronounce pitched components with a power of 37Hz and 74Hz fill that help void with a 'D' note. According to Senior, [...] "the problem is that this only really supports the D‑major chord, destabilizing the home chord of F# minor (by implying that it's actually part of a D‑major 7th chord) and clashing nastily with the A‑major." [...] He further stated that although might not be as apparent on small speakers, it still represents [...] "weakness" [...] for him. The section of the song at 3:12 has four bars without the kick-drum and four without it.|$|E
