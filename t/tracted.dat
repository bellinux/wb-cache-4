The health of these <b>tracts</b> {{is an important factor}} underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each <b>tract</b> for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the <b>tract,</b> and disease can strike at local positions within the <b>tract.</b> Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber <b>tract</b> (<b>Tract</b> Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that <b>tract.</b> We demonstrate several novel findings related to <b>Tract</b> Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a <b>tract</b> but the <b>Tract</b> FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, <b>Tract</b> Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the <b>Tract</b> Profile, rather than along the entire <b>tract.</b> Third, <b>Tract</b> Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized <b>Tract</b> Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, <b>Tract</b> Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the <b>Tract</b> Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures <b>Tract</b> Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter <b>tracts.</b> With further validation, AFQ <b>Tract</b> Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making...|$|R
