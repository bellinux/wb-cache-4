Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.

The humble origins of the horse and {{the people around him}} played a role in his popularity, as did the horse's people-focused attitude. Supporters appeared to be further motivated by the continuing doubts raised by industry experts about California Chrome's ability.|$|E
500|$|Despite waning {{popularity}} at home, Wałęsa's international reputation remained untouched. He {{continued his}} lecture circuit around the world, occasionally appearing in [...] headlines.

We were hoping that Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America, but that failed... in terms of politics and morality America no longer leads the world". Wałęsa also accused Obama of not deserving his Nobel Peace Prize; during the 2012 US presidential campaign he endorsed Obama's opponent Mitt Romney. In September 2015, Wałęsa again hit the headlines after sharing his thoughts on the migrant crisis in Europe with media, saying, [...] "watching the refugees on television, I noticed that...they are well fed, well dressed and maybe even are richer than we are...If Europe opens its gates, soon millions will come through and while living among us will start exercising their own customs, including beheading".|$|E
500|$|Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney {{chairman}} and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations {{more difficult than}} they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson <b>told</b> <b>CNN,</b> [...] "We {{would love to be}} in business with Pixar. They are a great company." [...] After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, to see how things would play out between the two companies.|$|E

The petition, according to The New York Times has [...] "reignited long-simmering tensions in the architectural world over whether women have been consistently denied the standing they deserve in a field whose most prestigious award was not given to a woman until 2004, when Zaha Hadid won." [...] Although the petition received international support of several past recipients, the jury said that it cannot revisit the work of past juries, in order to acknowledge the work of Denise Scott Brown and Lu Wenyu, both women and equal partners to their spouses Venturi and Wang Shu, who won in 1991 and 2012 respectively. Scott Brown <b>told</b> <b>CNN</b> that [...] "as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career," [...] and that [...] "the Pritzker Prize {{was based on the}} fallacy that great architecture was the work of a 'single lone male genius' at the expense of collaborative work." ...|$|E
500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself <b>told</b> <b>CNN</b> that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, {{he was not going to}} tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.” ...|$|E

Prince would inspire [...] "Nice & Slow" [...] while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher {{said in an interview with}} Sway Calloway; [...] "the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was saying on his records it motivated methere'd been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his".|$|E
