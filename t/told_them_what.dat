500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the reading}} ( [...] , aliyah) continues, God told Aaron {{to go to}} the {{wilderness}} to meet Moses, and he went, met him at the mountain of God, and kissed him. Moses told him all that God had said, and they gathered the Israelite elders and Aaron <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> God had said and performed the signs. The people believed, and when they heard that God had remembered them and seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshipped. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So on Saturday I gave ’em a week’s notice," [...] {{continued}} her husband, [...] "and after Potts and Co. had listened while I <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> <b>what</b> I thought of ’em, they said they’d {{do without the}} week’s notice." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the time}} of the events of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron learned from Gollum that the One Ring was held by a hobbit named Baggins in a land called [...] "Shire". [...] Sauron sent the Ringwraiths forth to search for the Ring. The Riders did not at first know the {{location}} of the Shire, and were dispelled by Saruman from Isengard, but when they came by chance upon Gríma Wormtongue in Rohan, he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> he knew of Saruman's plans, including his interest in the Shire and the Shire's location.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after this}} {{there was a}} rather strange {{series of events that}} led to the {{deportation}} of Bishop Colin Winter. David de Beer, the diocesan treasurer, was asked to speak to a student group at the University of the Witwatersrand (his alma mater) on Namibia. Among other things he spoke about the contract labour system, saying that it was a form of slavery, and mentioned an incident in which the supervisor of a group of contact workers had threatened them with immediate dismissal if they bought Bibles, {{on the grounds that they}} were [...] "communist Bibles". So the employers controlled the workers' leisure time, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they could or could not read.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{purchased}} the Victoria Times Colonist in 1959 for $750,000, {{and one year}} later built a plant to print both the Times and The Colonist, which he gained control of in 1953 for $1 million. In 1954, Bell acquired a controlling interest in the Lethbridge Herald. He {{had a habit of}} appearing unannounced at the offices of his papers, often to chat with the editors, but never <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> to print. Bell continued to acquire newspapers, joining with Victor Sifton, owner of the Winnipeg Free Press to purchase the Ottawa Journal in 1959. The pair combined their interests to form FP (Federated Paper) Publications Ltd. that same year. Bell {{purchased the}} Vancouver Sun in 1963, and Toronto's Globe and Mail in 1965, making FP Publications Canada's largest newspaper syndicate. [...] By 1972, the papers had a combined circulation of over 820,000.|$|E

In fact, the way they obeyed your mate suggested that there's not much liking between men and officers on board this packet. If there was any trouble, I don't know that they'd take your side." ...|$|R

2500|$|On Saturday morning, McQueary called Paterno {{to arrange}} a meeting, and the two met at Paterno's home later that same morning. [...] McQueary testified he gave a rough report {{of what he had}} seen but that out of respect he did not share more {{intimate}} details. [...] Paterno left for Pittsburgh to attend an awards ceremony shortly after meeting with McQueary and did not return to State College until late Saturday night or Sunday morning. [...] On Sunday morning, Paterno called then athletic director Timothy Curley regarding the incident. [...] Curley, along with then university Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz, both went to Paterno's home that same day, and Paterno <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> McQueary had reported to him and advised them that because McQueary had not provided details to Paterno, he recommended that they speak directly to McQueary. [...] In his grand jury testimony, Paterno said that he was only told about Sandusky [...] "fondling or doing something of a sexual nature" [...] to the victim.|$|E
2500|$|This {{incident}} alarmed Bernadotte, {{but before}} he could take stronger measures, the news reached La Romana that Rafael Lobo, an agent of the Spanish Junta had arrived offshore. Lobo indicated that the British fleet was en route, so the Spanish general got the word to his subordinates {{that it was time to}} execute the plan. The Spanish troops on Funen seized the port of Nyborg on 7 August. [...] The only resistance was from two Danish vessels in the harbour - the brig Fama and the smaller Søe-Ormen - [...] which were attacked by a British frigate and overwhelmed. The next day, the soldiers on Jutland commandeered some small craft at Fredericia and Aarhus and sailed to Funen. The Infante, Rey, and Zamora Regiments made a clean getaway, but the colonel of the Algarve regiment refused to budge. Finally, the senior captain put the plan into motion but it was too late. Finally aware of the plot, Kindelan rode to a nearby French camp and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> was going on. A brigade of Dutch hussars intercepted the Algarve Regiment and forced their surrender; the senior captain then killed himself.|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them say exactly what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E
