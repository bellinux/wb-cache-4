After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> for this further move is also unclear.

Besides, <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> of interruptions used by the female presenter were only seeking clarification, giving completion and seeking further information. However, there were some reasons of interruptions, that is, asking for help and showing annoyance that did not occur in the dialogue.
