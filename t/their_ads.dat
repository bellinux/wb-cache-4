5|$|The King of Fighters series {{director}} Toyohisa Tanabe {{asserted that}} the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults, and the newer KOF characters were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences. Characters such as Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan were added to have an off-beat variety to the cast, which he has previously deemed to be too serious. SNK artist C.A.C Yamasaki commented that although the lead programmer thought the game would not sell well, he believed it would eventually become popular. Ten people arrived at the first location test, but larger numbers came to subsequent tests. The SNK staff also had troubles with advertising the game {{due to a lack}} of money and some of <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> were noted to be of a poor quality.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century El Espectador criticized other {{mass media}} in Colombia, which {{preferred}} {{to remain silent}} instead of denouncing the atrocities happening in the country. In the early 1980s, the daily published several articles denouncing illegal loans and other irregularities allegedly performed by the Grupo Grancolombiano, {{one of the most}} powerful financial groups at the time. As retaliation, several big companies pulled <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> from the paper, which was already facing some financial issues. El Espectador disputed accusations made against it and dedicated an editorial piece to its credibility and the credibility of the financial groups.|$|E
25|$|The German Atheist Bus Campaign had {{problems}} finding a bus company that would run <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> {{and the official}} website states that they were rejected by 17 companies from all over Germany. Instead they decided to drive the bus themselves on a tour that covered 20 major German cities.

This decision was met with mixed reactions from the supporters of the campaign who had originally hoped for a conventional advertising campaign, which had succeeded in other countries.|$|E
500|$|In March 2017, the {{government}} of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremism content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would [...] "be delivered in a safe and appropriate way". The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had [...] "begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> appear". In early-April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after {{it was found that the}} ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.|$|E

500|$|Picket Fences {{was one of}} {{the first}} American {{television}} series to feature an intimate kiss between two women. Two years earlier, L. A. Law had aired an episode (also written by Kelley) that included a kiss between bisexual-identified character C. J. Lamb (Amanda Donohoe) and straight-identifying Abby Perkins (Michele Greene). The kiss led to complaints to the network and five sponsors pulled <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> from the episode. In reviewing incidents of lesbian kisses on network television programs, the New York Times noted that they tended to happen during [...] "sweeps" [...] periods, when the networks use Nielsen ratings to determine advertising rates. Noting lesbian kisses during sweeps periods on such shows as L. A. Law, Roseanne, Party of Five and Ally McBeal in addition to the Picket Fences episode and noting that they were occurring about once per year, the Times concludes that kisses between women are: [...] "Eminently visual; cheap, provided the actors are willing; controversial, year in and year out; and elegantly reversible (sweeps lesbians typically vanish or go straight when the week's over), kisses between women are perfect sweeps stunts. They offer something for everyone, from advocacy groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand psychological complexity to plot buffs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Courts {{have not}} yet had to decide whether {{advertisers}} can {{be held liable for}} spyware that displays <b>their</b> <b>ads.</b> In many cases, the companies whose advertisements appear in spyware pop-ups do not directly do business with the spyware firm.

2500|$|CBS set {{the base}} rate for a 30-second {{advertisement}} at $5,000,000, {{a record high}} price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning {{that for the first}} time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its [...] "Crash the Super Bowl" [...] contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game.

2500|$|Social {{media can}} be used not only as public {{relations}} and direct marketing tools but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities and as effective customer engagement tools. [...] Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper {{is likely to be}} read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google Adsense, advertisers can target <b>their</b> <b>ads</b> to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming. Google Adsense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with [...] "special issue" [...] sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).|$|E
