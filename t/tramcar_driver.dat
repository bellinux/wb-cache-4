50|$|In 2005, a third {{generation}} of unmanned cable tractors was introduced. These tractors are operated remotely by the drivers of the tramcars. Without {{the need for}} a cabin to accommodate a driver, these new cable tractors are low-profile vehicles, and thus do not obstruct the vision of the <b>tramcar</b> <b>driver</b> or the passengers when running downhill with the tractor leading.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} the war Georgy Matsievsky joined Grigory Semyonov in his anti-Bolshevik actions. He was one of {{the first}} {{officers}} enrolled in the Special Manchurian Detachment in December 1917. Georgy Matsievsky headed the 1st Transbaikalian Cossack Regiment (1918), the 1st Transbaikalian Cossack Division (1919) and finally the 1st Transbaikalian Corps of the Far Eastern Army in July 1920.

25|$|The Tramways Committee met {{nearly every}} two weeks and the minutes record a {{constant}} stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages too numerous to list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against <b>tramcar</b> <b>drivers</b> who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to <b>tramcar</b> <b>drivers</b> who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} men enlisting {{increased}} considerably, their places being taken by women employed as conductresses, the first starting about October 1915. Some 18 months later a visit {{was made by the}} Manager and others to Glasgow to see women working as <b>tramcar</b> <b>drivers.</b> They formed the opinion that this was not desirable in Nottingham. Track replacements took place during the year on the Arkwright Street, Bulwell and Mapperley sections, while the centre poles were replaced by side poles and span wires on Parliament Street and King Edward Street.|$|R
2500|$|William Kirk, {{driver of}} the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned for using abusive and {{threatening}} language to Israel Jordan, {{driver of the}} Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all {{the streets in the}} town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being {{on the wrong side of}} the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day Mr. Jordan was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language to him, and said [...] "You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before the week is out. The first time I meet you I'll knock you and the bus off the road." [...] Defendant also threatened to give complainant a [...] "good hiding". Israel Jordan was then called, and said he was one of the proprietors of the Nottingham and Bulwell Bus. He corroborated the statement of Mr. Stevenson. In reply to Mr. Barlow, he denied that he first used threatening language towards complainant. Frederick Bramley, residing at Hucknall Torkard also corroborated.-- There was a cross summons taken out by Kirk against Jordan for abusive language, and obstructing the steam car. The charge of using abusive language was withdrawn, but the other was proceeded with and Kirk was placed in the witness box. After hearing his evidence, however, the Bench dismissed the summons against Jordan, and fined Kirk 10s. The also expressed a hope that a better feeling would be established between <b>tramcar</b> <b>drivers</b> and conductors and the drivers of other vehicles.|$|R
