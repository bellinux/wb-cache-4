5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, {{who said he}} acted too favorably toward the Indians, even though he moved the <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives by physical distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not {{be given to the}} tribes. Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office, which became effective in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Arminius {{called his}} tribe, the Cherusci, and the {{surrounding}} <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> arms. Germanicus coordinated a land and riverine offensive, with troops marching eastward across the Rhine, and sailing from the North Sea up the Ems River in order to attack the Bructeri and Cherusci. Germanicus' forces went through Bructeri territory, where a general Lucius Stertinius recovered the lost eagle of the XIX Legion from among the equipment of the Bructeri after routing them in battle.|$|E

5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, {{there were}} a number of uprisings against the Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained with the aid of local <b>tribes.</b> <b>To</b> guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell. Collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late 1820s causing impoverishment for many Sioux hunters. The U.S. government strongly encouraged the <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> turn from hunting to farming, trading the woodlands for the plains.|$|E
5|$|Enver Pasha {{conceived}} {{an expedition}} to Afghanistan in 1914. He envisioned it as a pan-Islamic venture directed by Turkey, with some German participation. The German delegation to this expedition, chosen by Oppenheim and Zimmermann, included Oskar Niedermayer and Wilhelm Wassmuss. An escort of nearly a thousand Turkish troops and German advisers was to accompany the delegation through Persia into Afghanistan, where they hoped to rally local <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> jihad.|$|E

5|$|In 358, Julian first {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the Frankish tribes, crossing the lower Rhine and forced the Salii and Chamavi <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> surrender and become tributarii (tribute-payers). He then restored three important forts on the lower Meuse river. Finally, he again switched his attention to the Alamanni, crossing the Rhine at Mainz and forcing the submission of the new paramount kings Hortarius and Surmarius.|$|E
5|$|Jurchen {{migrants}} from the northeastern reaches of Jin territory {{settled in the}} Jin-controlled lands of northern China. Constituting less than {{ten percent of the}} total population, the two to three million ruling Jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million Han Chinese. The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad {{expelled}} from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, {{one of three}} main Jewish tribes, but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad's death. According to al-Waqidi, after Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy spoke for them, Muhammad refrained from executing them and commanded that they be exiled from Medina. Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances {{with a number of}} Bedouin <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable events during this period was the Treaty of St. Louis in which the Sac and Fox tribes ceded northeastern Missouri, {{northern}} Illinois and southern Wisconsin to the United States. Resentments over this treaty were to cause the <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> side with the British during the War of 1812 in raids along the Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and was to spur the Black Hawk War in 1832.|$|E

Six of these former missions (all now secular municipalities) collectively were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990.

5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

Clark supplied details on the area's plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native <b>tribes</b> <b>to</b> Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the Mound Builders to John P. Campbell.|$|E
