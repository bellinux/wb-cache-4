The album is called <b>Twin</b> <b>Flame</b> and {{pays tribute to}} celebrated jazz pianists. Hanka decided to work with selected instrumental tunes written by well-known jazz pianists, vocalized them and wrote her own lyrics. (Oscar Peterson, Ernest Oláh - famous gipsy Slovak pianist, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner, Thelonious Monk, Ondrej Krajňák and Mal Waldron). At the same time, this album represents the pinnacle of cooperation {{with one of the}} Europe best composers-pianists, Ondrej Krajňák originally from Slovakia. The album was named after his original composition <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames.</b> This name captures the essence of both artists whose music is something like karmic <b>twin</b> <b>flames,</b> representing one soul in two bodies, the exquisite balance between a female and male principle.|$|R

5000|$|According {{to spiritual}} {{teachers}} like Mark L. Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, {{it is not}} a soulmate that is one’s true love, perfect match, or literal other half as is often times imagined, but instead it is the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> that is one’s true love, perfect match or literal other half. In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames</b> the Prophet’s state that “A soulmate relationship {{has to do with the}} seat of the soul chakra, that chakra just above the base. The connection is one of parallel and mutual evolution rather than origin.”. With the chakra [...] "just above the base" [...] often being described as “the creativity and sexual chakra”, the Prophet’s claim that a true “literal other half” relationship doesn't center around energies or activities believed to be related to the sacral chakra is not completely inconsistent with the claims Plato makes about a literal other half relationship in his Symposium. In his Symposium, Plato has the character Aristophanes relate that “the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else.” In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames,</b> the Prophet’s state that “if you really meditate at inner levels, you know that that relationship doesn’t go as high or is not as profound as the one with the person who is your direct counterpart—the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> you have known as your other self from the first moment of your creation.” ...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} of n-decane polydisperse spray flames stabilized in a laminar two-dimensional counterflow configuration {{were conducted by}} the Eulerian/Lagrangian approach. For the gaseous phase, the Navier-Stokes equation together with mass, energy and species conservation equations was solved based on the finite control volume method with the SIMPLE algorithm. Transport properties and thermodynamic data of the gaseous species were obtained by CHEMKIN. For the disperse phase, all the individual droplets were tracked without using a concept of the droplet parcel. The film theory was employed for estimating a droplet evaporation rate and heat transferred from the gaseous phase to a droplet. As a result, {{it was found that}} <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> of premixed combustion of pre-vaporized fuel and diffusion combustion of droplet groups were observed on the spray flow side and that the combustion intensity of the <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> are different significantly depending on the droplet size distributions.

5000|$|In the 1988 {{released}} The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames,</b> Mark and Elizabeth Prophet {{describe the}} “one true love” or “origin” based <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> relationship that is oftentimes {{referred to as}} a soulmate relationship by saying “They are called <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> because they came out of the original single ovoid. The Electronic Presence of each soul is the exact duplicate of the other. And when they descend into form, one assumes the positive or masculine and one assumes the negative or feminine polarity.” The Prophet’s ideas about the physical nature of a “true love” relationship are not completely inconsistent with the words and ideas expressed by ancient philosophers and in various religious traditions. The Greek philosopher Aristotle is quoted as saying [...] "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies" [...] and the Zohar states that [...] "Each soul and spirit prior to its entering into this world, consists of a male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before, and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and left of one individual." [...] In Hinduism, the gods Shiva and Parvati fit the “right and left of one individual” description given in the Judaism related Zohar when represented in their composite androgynous form Ardhanarishvara. It is said that Ardhanarishvara “represents a synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe“. In Christian literature, there is mention of an Ardhanarishvara like “two into one” union in the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew “the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh”. Additionally, in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus reportedly describes a “two into one”, yin and yang like or Ardhanarishvara like relationship to his disciples as the way to enter the Kingdom. [...] "Jesus said to them, [...] "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter kingdom.". In Islam, it is believed that the Prophet Muhammad once said “women are the twin halves of men”.|$|R
40|$|In a triple-port burner, various non-premixed flames {{have been}} {{observed}} previously. Especially for the case with two lifted flames, such configuration could be suitable in studying interaction between two tribrachial flames.

Four different types of flame configurations, including two attached flames, inner lifted/outer attached flames, inner attached/outer lifted <b>flames,</b> and <b>twin</b> lifted <b>flames,</b> were successfully simulated depending on the flow conditions. The representative edge propagation speed of a single lifted flame or an upstream lifted flame {{in the case of}} <b>twin</b> lifted <b>flames</b> increased as the liftoff height became higher. In the <b>twin</b> lifted <b>flames,</b> the inner lifted flame was affected appreciably when the other flame was located further upstream such that the lifted flame located further downstream encountered the axial velocity acceleration induced by the gas expansion from the lifted flame located upstream, while thermal effects were not observed since the temperature of the incoming flow toward the lifted flame was not affected. A unique flip-flop behavior between the inner and outer flames, observed experimentally previously, was successfully captured in the simulation such that the inner lifted flame became attached to the nozzle as the liftoff height of the outer lifted flame grew higher with an increase in the outer air velocity...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{adiabatic}} laminar burning velocities of n-heptane, iso-octane, ethanol {{and their}} binary and tertiary mixtures are reported. Non-stretched flames were stabilized on a perforated plate burner at 1 atm. The Heat Flux method {{was used to}} determine burning velocities under conditions when the net heat loss from the flame to the burner is zero. Initial temperatures of the gas mixtures with air were 298 and 338 K. Uncertainties of the measurements were analyzed and assessed experimentally. The overall accuracy of the burning velocities was estimated to be better than +/- 1 cm/s. These new measurements were compared with the literature data when available. Experimental results in lean ethanol + air mixtures are systematically higher than previous measurements under similar conditions. Good agreement for n-heptane + air flames and for iso-octane + air flames was found with the experiments performed in counter-flow <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> with linear extrapolation to zero stretch.

40|$|Many fuels used in {{material}} processing and power generation applications are generally {{a blend of}} various hydrocarbons. Although the combustion and aerosol formation dynamics of individual fuels is well understood, the flame dynamics of fuel blends are yet to be characterized. This research uses a <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> counterflow burner to measure flame velocity, flame extinction, particulate formation and particulate morphology of hydrogen fuel blend flames at different H 2 concentration, oscillation frequencies and stretch conditions. Phase resolved spectroscopic measurements (emission spectra) of OH, H, O and CH radical/atom concentrations is used to characterize the heat release processes of the flame. In addition flame generated particulates are collected using thermophoretic sample technique and are qualitative analyzed using Raman Spectroscopy and SEM. Such measurements are essential {{for the development of}} advanced computational tools capable of predicting fuel blend flame characteristics at realistic combustor conditions.

Although a dual ignition system is a method of achieving optimum combustion and better fuel consumption, it remains rare in cars and motorcycles because of difficulties in siting the second plug within the cylinder head. The Nash Ambassador for 1932-1948 used twin sparkplugs on the straight eight engine, while later Alfa Romeo Twin Spark cars use dual ignition, as do Honda cars with the i-DSI series engines, and Chrysler's Modern Hemi engine. In 1980 Nissan installed twin sparkplugs on the Nissan NAPS-Z engine, with Ford introducing it on the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang four-cylinder models. Several modern Mercedes-Benz engines also have two spark plugs per cylinder, such as the M112 and M113 engines. Some motorcycles, such as the Honda VT500 and the Ducati Multistrada, also have dual ignition. The 2012 Ducati Multistrada was upgraded with [...] "twin-plug cylinder heads for smoother, more efficient combustion", the change contributing to a 5% increase in torque and a 10% improvement in fuel consumption.|$|R

40|$|A multi-fluid state {{approach}} {{is used to}} analyse the underlying conditions for burning mode transitions from close to the corrugated flamelet regime to distributed reactions. Turbulent (Ret ≃ 380) premixed DME/air flames were aerodynamically stabilised in a back-to-burnt opposed jet configuration with the Damköhler number varied through the mixture stoichiometry. Simultaneous Mie scattering, OH-PLIF and PIV allowed the delineation of five separate fluid states (reactants, combustion products, mixing fluid, mildly and strongly reacting fluids) with associated material surfaces. The analysis shows self-sustained flames in low strain regions with a collocated flow acceleration for higher Damköhler numbers. By contrast, in highly strained regions (e. g. beyond the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> extinction point) the burning mode is governed by the counter-flowing hot combustion products resulting in increased levels of vorticity and an absence of a preferential dilatation direction. The current analysis provides novel insights into combustion regime transitions by means of (i) strain rate statistics conditioned upon material surfaces and (ii) the evolution of fluid state interface probabilities {{as a function of}} the Damköhler number. The work further shows (iii) that the combustion mode influences scalar transport and that increased levels of turbulence retards the transition to non-gradient transport...|$|R

40|$|Premixed-gas flames {{subject to}} steady spatially-varying {{straining}} flows were studied to examine {{one aspect of}} premixed flames in strongly turbulent flows where strain rate gradients are present and local strain rates may be high enough to cause local flame-front extinguishment. The spatially-varying straining flows were created using a counterflow slot-jet burner with slightly non-parallel jet exits. When the flow configuration was premixed combustible gas vs. cold inert gas, so that only a single flame was produced, steady flame “edges ” could be created where the flame would exist in the low-strain region but would be extinguished in the high-strain region. When the flow configuration was premixed gas vs. premixed gas, <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> would exist in the low-strain region that converged to a corner-like tip in the high-strain region. For both configurations the local strain {{at the location of}} the stationary flame edge was somewhat lower than the strain required to extinguish flames in the same mixture subject to a spatially uniform strain.

40|$|The {{flammability}} of alternative, non-ozone depleting refrigerants is {{an issue}} of growing importance to the air-conditioning and refrigeration industry. Test methods developed decades ago are being stretched to their limits when measuring the combustion behavior of weakly flammable refrigerants. This work is Phase 2 of a three part project to determine the feasibility, accuracy, and applicability of a premixed opposed-flow burner as an alternative means of measuring lean flammability limits. In this work, the Phase 2 burner demonstrates the precision available to the opposed-flow technique for evaluating the lean flammability limit of weak fuels. Using opposed, converging nozzles, two jets support a premixed <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> at different global strain rates and permit evaluation of the corresponding fuel concentration at the extinction point. Comparisons with published data support that the LFL{sub 0 }, a lean flammability limit value defined by the extrapolation of the extinction conditions to zero global strain, yields a consistent value. Using a computer simulation to analyze the uncertainty, the lean flammability limit of refrigerants in dry air is found. Concurrent computational modeling of the combustion of refrigerants in air, individually and in mixtures has been performed with the chemical kinetics code CHEMKIN. Estimates {{of the impact of the}} initial conditions (equivalence ratio, fuel composition, temperature, and relative humidity) on the magnitude of the laminar flame speed of a zero strain flame are made...|$|R
40|$|The flame {{extinction}} limits of syngas (H{sub 2 }-CO) flames were measured using a twin-flame-counter-flow burner. Plots of Extinction limits vs. global stretch rates were generated at different mixture compositions and an extrapolation method {{was used to}} calculate the {{flame extinction}} limit corresponding to an experimentally unattainable zero-stretch condition. The zero-stretch extinction limit of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures decreases (from rich to lean) with the increase in H{sub 2 } concentration in the mixture. The average difference between the measured flame extinction limit and the Le Chatelier's calculation is around {approx} 7 %. The measured OH{sup -} chemiluminescent data indicates that regardless of mixture compositions the OH radical concentration reduces (within the experimental uncertainties) to an extinction value prior to the flame extinction. Flame extinction limits of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures measured in a flat-flame burner configuration also show a similar relation. Additionally, the measured laminar flame velocity close to the extinction indicates that regardless of fuel composition the premixed flame of hydrogen fuel blends extinguishes when the mixture laminar flame velocity falls below a critical value. The critical laminar flame velocity at extinction for H{sub 2 }-CO premixed flames (measured in the flat flame burner configuration) is found to be 3. 77 ({+-} 0. 38) cm/s. An externally perturbed H{sub 2 }-CO <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> was not experimentally achievable for the mixture conditions used in the present investigation.

40|$|Premixed CH 4 /O 2 /CO 2 flames (oxy-flames) and CH 4 /air flames (air-flames) were {{experimentally}} {{studied in}} a swirl-stabilized combustor. For comparing oxy and air flames, the same equivalence ratio and adiabatic flame temperature were used. CO 2 dilution was adjusted {{to attain the}} same adiabatic temperature for the oxy-flame and the corresponding air-flame while keeping the equivalence ratio and Reynolds number (= 20, 000) the same. For high equivalence ratios, we observed flames stabilized along {{the inner and outer}} shear layers of the swirling flow and sudden expansion, respectively, in both flames. However, one notable difference between the two flames appears as the equivalence ratio reaches 0. 60. At this point, the outer shear layer flame disappears in the air-flame while it persists in the oxy-flame, despite the lower burning velocity of the oxy-flame. Prior PIV measurements (Ref. 9) showed that the strains along the outer shear layer are higher than along the inner shear layer. Therefore, the extinction strain rates in both flames were calculated using a counter-flow premixed <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> configuration. Calculations at the equivalence ratio of 0. 60 show that the extinction strain rate is higher in the oxy than in the air flame, which help explain why it persists on the outer shear layer with higher strain rate. It is likely that extinction strain rates contribute to the oxy-flame stabilization when air flame extinguish in the outer shear layer. However, the trend reverses at higher equivalence ratio, and the cross point of the extinction strain rate appears at equivalence ratio of 0. 64...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} quantifies the {{probability}} of encountering up to five fluid states (reactants, combustion products, mixing fluid, fluids with low and high reactivity) in premixed turbulent DME flames {{as a function of}} the Damköhler number. The flames were aerodynamically stabilised in a back-to-burnt opposed jet configuration featuring fractal grid generated multi-scale turbulence (Re≃[*] 18, 400 and Ret > 370). The chemical timescale was varied via the mixture stoichiometry resulting in a wide range of Damköhler numbers (0. 08 ≤ [*]Da[*] ≤ 5. 6). The mean turbulent strain (≥ 3200 s− 1) exceeded the extinction strain rate of the corresponding laminar flames for all mixtures. Simultaneous Mie scattering, OH-PLIF and PIV were used to identify the fluid states and supporting computations show that the thermochemical state (e. g. OH and CH concentrations) at the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> extinction point correlates well with flames in the back-to-burnt geometry at the corresponding rate of heat release. For mixtures where the bulk strain (≃ 750 s− 1) was similar to (or less than) the extinction strain rate, fluids with low and high reactivity could accordingly be segregated by a threshold based on the OH concentration at the extinction point. A sensitivity analysis of the distribution between the fluid states was performed. The flow conditions were further analysed in terms of Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers. The study provides (i) the evolution of multi-fluid probability statistics {{as a function of the}} Damköhler number, including (ii) the flow direction across fluid interfaces and OH gradients, (iii) mean flow field statistics, (iv) conditional velocity statistics and (v) a tentative combustion regime classification...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion {{in both the}} premixed and the non-premixed regime. Non-premixed hybrid bluff-body/swirl flames are simulated {{by means of a}} steady flamelet model (Flamelet-LES) based on detailed chemical kinetics. LES of lean premixed <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> stabilised on a turbulent opposed jet (TOJ) burner are carried out using an algebraic Flame Surface Density model (FSD-LES) and a newly developed model based on Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM-LES). Isothermal swirling flow at a medium Reynolds and swirl number is simulated first and the LES model is shown to accurately predict the velocity statistics and the complex flow field governed by vortex breakdown and two recirculation zones. The Flamelet- LES model is subsequently used to simulate a low speed swirling methane flame and the capability of the model to predict downstream recirculation, vortex breakdown and central jet precession in the presence of heat release is demonstrated. The simulation of two high speed hydrogen/methane swirl flames with the Flamelet-LES model shows that some quantitative predictions of this challenging test case for combustion simulation can be achieved, while the overall predictions are not satisfactory. The flamelet approach is found sensitive to minor errors in the mixing field which strongly affect the simulation results due to the highly non-linear mixture fraction/density relationship. Non-reacting simulations of turbulent opposed jet flows at moderate Reynolds number are performed and compared to experimental reference data. The inclusion of the flow field inside the nozzles into the computational domain is shown to yield accurate predictions of the velocity statistics between the nozzles. For these predictions the detailed knowledge of the initial jet development region near the turbulence generating plates is vital and provided by PIV measurements inside a glass nozzle. FSD-LES of the <b>twin</b> premixed TOJ <b>flames</b> show that the velocity statistics, both along the burner axis and the stagnation plane, can be predicted to high accuracy. However, the algebraic flame surface density model employed in the present study requires the adjustment of a model parameter and as a result, predictions of the turbulent burning velocity cannot be achieved. The comparison of two different interpretations of the FSD model show that a formulation using an additional diffusion term allows for a better resolution of the premixed flames in LES than the original formulation without diffusion. A complex LEM combustion model is first developed as a Stand-Alone approach to simulate premixed combustion and subsequently coupled to LES. The LEM-LES model requires a number of sub-models to represent the effects of sub-grid stirring, finite-rate chemistry, sub-grid expansion, 3 D convection (splicing) and flame propagation which are described in detail. The LEM-LES model is – to the author’s knowledge – the first attempt to simulate premixed flames with finite-rate chemistry in incompressible turbulent flow. Preliminary results from the application of LEM-LES to the premixed <b>twin</b> TOJ <b>flames</b> are reported and show a high sensitivity to the 3 D convection model and the requirement to improve the splicing procedure for premixed flames in anisotropic turbulent flow. The difficulty to accurately resolve the turbulent flow field by LES while simultaneously accommodating a premixed flame of finite thickness on the LEM sub-grid is found to be a challenge for the LEM-LES of premixed TOJ flames.
