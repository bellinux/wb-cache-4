He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior.

Poniewozik states that Eddard [...] "doesn't seem to consider that he has options: he is left to rule in the king's place, an injustice has been committed, the law requires one path to justice and he chooses it. This makes his decision easy, but it may make his life, and others', difficult." [...] According to The Atlantics Scott Meslow, [...] "Ned's principles are, as always, admirable, and he's clearly interested in justice.

[...] He added, however, that there were problems preventing the widespread acceptance of any of the alternatives, as large mutations seemed too uncommon, and there was no experimental evidence of mechanisms that could support either Lamarckism or orthogenesis. Ernst Mayr wrote that a survey of evolutionary literature and biology textbooks showed that as late as 1930 the belief that natural selection was {{the most important factor in}} evolution was a minority viewpoint, with only a few population geneticists being strict selectionists.|$|E

Secret 1908 " regarding the affair of persons using the same name, whose lives' paths interwove among the walls of Jagellonian University-Professor of philosophy Maurycy Straszewski and a Philosophy Faculty student Jan. The records tell an interesting matter, difficult to clear up: Jan Straszewski during his studies referred to the fact of being the University professor's son.

2500|$|The Police's power trio line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers {{performed}} {{for the first}} time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in the English city of Birmingham in the West Midlands. A trio was unusual for the time, and this line-up endured for the rest of the band's history. Few punk bands were three-pieces, while contemporary bands pursuing progressive rock, symphonic rock and other sound trends usually expanded their line-ups with support players. The musical background of all three players may have made them suspect to punk purists, with music critic Christopher Gable stating, [...] "The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band merely utilized the trappings of 1970s British punk: the bleached blond short hair, Sting in his jumpsuits or army jackets, Copeland and his near maniacal drumming style. In fact, they were criticized by other punk bands for not being authentic and lacking [...] "street cred." [...] What the Police did perhaps take from punk was a brand of nervous, energetic disillusion with 1970s Britain." [...] The band were also able to draw on influences from reggae to jazz to progressive and pub rock.|$|E
2500|$|Another US historian, David Healy, refuted this, and Fredrick B. Pike {{calls this}} {{allegation}} [...] "absurd": The economic development that accompanied {{and followed the}} War of the Pacific was so remarkable that Marxist writers feel justified in alleging that Chile's great military adventure was instigated by self-seeking capitalists {{in order to bring}} their country out of the business stagnation that had begun in 1878. However absurd this allegation, the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war did provide Chile with the economic means for coming of age. Sater states that this interpretation overlooks certain important facts. The Chilean investors in Bolivia feared that Daza, the Bolivian dictator, would use, as he did, the war as an excuse to expropriate his investments. Among them were Melchor de Concha y Toro, the politically powerful president of Chile's Camara de Diputados, , and Lorenzo Claro, a Chilean founder of the Banco de Bolivia and a prominent member of the National Party (Chile, 1857–1933). A Santiago newspaper claimed that Melchor de Concha y Toro offered president Pinto $2,000,000 to end the dispute and return to the 1874 boundary line. [...] "In other words", writes W. Sater, [...] "there were as many powerful interests opposed to helping the Compañía de Salitres as there were those seeking to aid the corporation" [...] Also, B. Farcau objects to the argument: [...] "On the other hand, the sorry state of the Chilean armed forces at the outbreak of the war, as will be discussed in the following chapter, hardly supports a theory of conscious, premeditated aggression".|$|E

50|$|However, most {{miscarriage}} {{of justice}} cases in Japan are, indeed, the results of conviction solely based on the confession of the accused.

During the 1970s, a series of reversals of death penalty cases brought attention to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> some accused, after intensive interrogation signed as-yet unwritten confessions, which were later filled in by investigating police officers.
