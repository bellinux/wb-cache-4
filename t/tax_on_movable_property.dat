50|$|The {{poll tax}} was {{essentially}} a lay subsidy (a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> {{of most of the}} population) to help fund war. It had first been levied in 1275 and continued, under different names, until the 17th century. People were taxed a percentage of the assessed value of their movable goods. That percentage varied from year to year and place to place, and which goods could be taxed differed between urban and rural locations. Churchmen were exempt, as were the poor, workers in the Royal Mint, inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, tin workers in Cornwall and Devon, and those who lived in the Palatinate counties of Cheshire and Durham.|$|R

The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /orm/*. *. Taken from miscellaneous published and unpublished data, they relate to English revenues, especially those from indirect taxation.

50|$|In {{the reign}} of King John (1199-1216), the loss of Normandy and his {{concessions}} {{to the demands of}} the feudal barons set out in Magna Carta rendered financial re-adjustment inevitable. During the long reign of King Henry III(1216-1272), the enforcement by the barons of their privileges granted by Magna Carta acted on the fiscal system by checking the king's arbitrary use of tallages and, as a consequence, encouraged regular assessments of a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>movables,</b> which became more prevalent over time. The developing concept of necessity to obtain consent of tax-payers before imposition operated to encourage the establishment of bodies representing the various social classes. Indeed, the action of constitutional on fiscal development led to the transition from feudal to parliamentary taxation in its earliest forms.|$|R
50|$|The first {{effects of}} {{parliamentary}} {{influence on the}} fiscal system were the abandonment of tallages on towns {{and the decline of}} scutage. <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>movables</b> were assessed more systematically so that instead of using varying charges, ranging from one-fourth to one-fortieth, on different classes of goods, the tax was imposed at fixed rates of one-tenth on towns and one-fifteenth on counties. Commissioners were appointed for each county to ensure stricter assessment and were supplied with special instructions as to taxable and exempt goods. This tax remained in force from 1290 to 1334, albeit the proportions imposed varied over time (e.g. an eighth and a fifth were granted to the king by parliament in 1297, and a tenth and a sixth in 1322).|$|R

40|$|Until 2003 {{gifts of}} {{building}} lots were taxed {{the same way}} as gifts of other property in the Flemish region. Due to the growing scarcity in the residential land market and the corresponding price shifts, the Flemish government decided to introduce a tax reduction for gift <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>movables</b> and <b>on</b> building lots. Marginal tax rates decreased considerably, especially for gifts to more distinct relatives and to total strangers. In the period 2003 - 2006 this resulted in a significant rise of the intergenerational transfers of property. In this study we focus on the effects of the decrease of the <b>tax</b> rates <b>on</b> building lots. As this measure aimed to increase the supply of housing, we test how this might have affected housing starts. As the reduction of the tax rate was not implemented by the other 2 Belgian Regions, Brussels and Wallonia, we focus on interregional differences. The impact of the gift tax reduction is investigated by means of a panel data study using building permits for the period 1997 - 2007 on the level of 588 out of 589 Belgian communities. The results indicate that housing starts are related to inflation, interest on mortgages, demographic variables and housing market developments.
