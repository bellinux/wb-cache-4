The fact that the selenoGAPDH is NAD-saturated supports a binding of hydroperoxide and reductant in the substrate binding site.

In particular, HMP possesses a high catalytic activity and a low Km toward cumyl, linoleic acid, and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxides,</b> whereas it is a less efficient hydrogen peroxide scavenger. An analysis of UV-visible spectra during the stationary state reveals that at variance with classical peroxidases, HMP turns over in the ferrous state. In particular, an iron oxygen adduct intermediate whose spectrum is similar to that reported for the oxo-ferryl derivative in peroxidases (Compound II), has been identified during the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide reduction. This finding suggests that hydroperoxide cleavage occurs upon direct binding of a peroxide oxygen atom to the ferrous heme iron. Competitive inhibition of the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity by carbon monoxide has also been observed, thus confirming that heme iron is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction.

This view {{is based on the}} completeness of metabolic pathways, infrequency of nutritional auxotrophies, and paucity of pathway redundancies typically found in bacteria with larger genomes. Thus, genetic analysis of gene function is often hampered by lethality. In the absence of controllable promoters, often used to titrate gene function, we investigated the feasibility of an antisense RNA interference strategy. To test the antisense approach, we targeted alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), one of the most abundant proteins expressed by H. pylori and one whose function is essential for both in vitro growth and gastric colonization. Here, we show that antisense ahpC (as-ahpC) RNA expression from shuttle vector pDH 37 ::as-ahpC achieved an ∼ 72 % knockdown of AhpC protein levels, which correlated with increased susceptibilities to hydrogen peroxide, cumene, and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxides</b> but not with growth efficiency.

Expression of single-copy antisense constructs (expressed under the urease promoter and containing an fd phage terminator) from the rdxA locus of mouse-colonizing strain X 47 achieved a 32 % knockdown of AhpC protein levels (relative to wild-type X 47 levels), which correlated with increased susceptibility to organic peroxides but not with mouse colonization efficiency. Our studies indicate that high levels of AhpC are not required for in vitro growth or for primary gastric colonization. Perhaps AhpC, like catalase, assumes a greater role in combating exogenous peroxides arising from lifelong chronic inflammation.

Analogous experiments with 3, 3, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (TMPO) led only to the trapping of alkoxyl radicals with no evidence for peroxyl radical adducts, this is presumably due to a decreased rate of radical addition because of increased steric hindrance...|$|R
40|$|One main {{aspect of}} {{high energy density}} {{material}} (HEDM) design is to obtain greener alternatives for HEDMs that produce toxic byproducts. Primary explosives lead azide, lead styphnate, and mercury fulminate contain heavy metals that cause heavy metal poisoning. Leaching of the widely used tertiary explosive NH 4 ClO 4 into groundwater has resulted in human exposure to ClO 4 – ions, which cause disruptions of thyroid related metabolic pathways and even thyroid cancer. Many research efforts to find replacements have gained little success. Thus, {{there is a need}} for greener HEDMs. Peroxo-based oxygen-rich compounds are proposed as a potential new class of greener HEDMs due to the evolution of CO 2 and/or CO, H 2 O, and O 2 as the main decomposition products. Currently, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), diacetone diperoxide (DADP), hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) are the only well-studied highly energetic peroxides. However, due to their high impact and friction sensitivities, low thermal stabilities, and low detonation velocities they have not found any civil or military HEDM applications. In this dissertation research, we have synthesized and fully characterized four categories of peroxo-based compounds: tert-butyl peroxides, <b>tert-butyl</b> peroxy esters, <b>hydroperoxides,</b> and peroxy acids to perform a systematic study of their sensitivities and the energetic properties for potential use as greener HEDMs. tert-Butyl peroxides were not sensitive to impact, friction, or electrostatic spark. Hence, tert-butyl peroxides can be described as fairly safe peroxo-based compounds to handle. tert-Butyl peroxy esters were all surprisingly energetic (4896 – 6003 m/s), despite the low oxygen and nitrogen contents. Aromatic tert-butyl peroxy esters were much lower in impact and friction sensitivities with respect to the known peroxo-based explosives. These are among the first low sensitivity peroxo-based compounds that can be categorized as secondary HEDMs. Oxygen-rich (0. 80 – 1. 00) geminal hydroperoxides have detonation velocities in the range of 6150 – 7130 m/s. These impressive detonation velocities are greater than the detonation velocities of the known peroxo-based explosives. The highest detonation velocity (7130 m/s) was obtained for 1, 4 -bis(dihydroperoxymethyl) benzene, which has the highest crystalline density (1. 648 g/cm 3). This detonation velocity is greater than the secondary explosive 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT). The sensitivities of these oxygen-rich geminal hydroperoxides are lower than the known peroxo-based explosives due to the O–H•••O hydrogen bonds and O•••O contacts, which stabilize the weak O–O bonds in the crystalline lattice. They could be useful as primary HEDMs. Dihydroperoxy dioxane and dioxolanes have impressive detonation velocities in the range of 6350 – 6694 m/s. However, their extremely high sensitivities render them unsafe for HEDM applications. Interestingly, hydroperoxy dioxanol and dioxolanols also have high detonation velocities in the range of 6100 – 6461 m/s even with the lower oxygen contents. The hydroperoxy compounds with one less O–O bond were much less sensitive than the dihydroperoxy compounds. These hydroperoxy compounds could be useful as primary HEDMs. We observed that the ring strain was useful in increasing the detonation velocities, since it led to compounds with higher crystalline densities. However, increasing the steric strain using bulky groups led to lower crystalline densities and lower detonation velocities. Higher steric strain not only resulted in higher sensitivities but also lower thermal stabilities. Peroxy acids have high detonation velocities in the range of 5262 – 7885 m/s. The detonation velocity of 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoperoxoic acid (7217 m/s) was the highest detonation velocity obtained for the peroxo-based compounds synthesized in our study, which is greater than the detonation velocity of TNT. The detonation velocity of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzoperoxoic acid (7885 m/s) is close to the detonation velocity of the secondary high explosive 1, 3, 5 -trinitroperhydro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX). Peroxy acids have surprisingly low impact and friction sensitivities that are well below the known peroxo-based explosives TATP, DADP, HMTD, and MEKP. Based on the crystal structure of 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoperoxoic acid, the low sensitivities can be attributed to the stabilization of the weak O–O bonds in the crystalline lattice by O–H•••O hydrogen bonds and O•••O short contacts. These are the first peroxo-based oxygen-rich compounds that can be useful as secondary HEDMs. The ease of synthesis in high yields with minimum synthetic manipulations, storability, and high thermal stabilities are all advantageous properties of peroxy acids for their use as HEDMs. Through this work, we have gained a wealth of fundamental information about the structures and energetic materials properties of a large family of peroxo-based compounds. Solid state intermolecular interactions were useful to understand the impact and friction sensitivities. The safe peroxy O:C ratio was found to be approximately 1. 00. However, the oxygen contents could be further increased with more stable nitro and hydroxy groups. Highly attractive low sensitivity peroxo-based compounds were obtained with impressive detonation performances for potential use as greener primary and secondary HEDMs...|$|R
