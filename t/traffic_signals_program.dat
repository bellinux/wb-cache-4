40|$|AbstractChanging <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>programs</b> due to <b>traffic</b> {{dynamics}} is {{an essential}} step {{to improve the quality of}} the city's traffic management. But the large number of players, who are competing for the same resources, complicates the selection of new <b>signal</b> <b>programs.</b> The cars, Public Transport (PT) and pedestrians all coming from different directions create a complex right of way allocation problem. The selection of a new program becomes an especially complex task when PT priority logic is integrated into the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> planning. This paper suggests a methodology for performing the selection process. The methodology described in this article for selecting an alternative <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> is based on a definition of Standard Planning Attributes (SPA), which serve as a “data dictionary”.

40|$|In {{planning}} traffic-dependent {{controls for}} <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> systems repetitive subproblems frequently occur. Solutions {{which are used}} {{again and again in}} the same or deviating form exist for such subproblems at many planning offices and producers of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> systems. However as a rule these differ considerably in terms of their realization, application width and parameters. Present solutions for subproblems with <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> systems are frequently not known generally, are documented in various forms and depth, are too specialized to one certain purpose or characterized highly by the style of the specific manufacturer, so that subsequent modifications by other processors may be difficult. The main objective of this research and development project was therefore to develop primary requirements for definition of the function and description of the treatment of universally applicable software modules for traffic-dependent <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controls, with the intention of creating a basis for solving traffic-related problems with virtual independence from the planner or manufacturer and ensure uniform treatment in the development of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>programs.</b> This research and development project is therefore intended to create the basis for modularization and standardization in order to establish a 'library' with appropriate modules in the future. Analysis of the problems specified showed that a significant step toward a solution would be to differentiate between specification and realization of a module. In contrast to module realization, module specification allows formulation of the function with virtual independence from the planner/manufacturer, thereby allowing potential users a better decision in terms of selection, application or new development of a module.

By Michelle S.

While <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing projects produce one of the highest benefit-cost ratios for improvement to the highway transportation system, findings from the 2007 National <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signal</b> Report Card indicate that, overall, <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> operations in the United States score a D grade, up slightly from a D- grade reported in 2005. 2 With the majority of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> systems across the United States having the potential for vastly improved performance, the need for guidance and resources for <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing <b>programs</b> has never been greater.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>signal</b> {{control was}} first invented in 1868 in Great Britain. Then, it has quickly spread across many other countries, what are now usually {{developed}} countries. Therefore, {{during a long}} history of development, <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> usually have been dealing with traffic in which four-wheel vehicles {{play an important role in}} motorised traffic. However, as a result of an unequal development among countries, many Motorcycle Dependent Cities (MDCs) nowadays still exist mostly in the developing countries such as: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), New Delhi (India), Taipei (Taiwan), Bangkok (Thailand), etc. In these cities, motorcycles play an important role in motorised traffic. Because motorised traffic dominated by motorcycles was born later than car traffic, the complete application of <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> from developed countries, which usually deals with four-wheel vehicles, to these specific traffic conditions of two-wheel vehicles is usually ineffective. In practice, it has been causing many traffic problems at <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> To solve problems at <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> in MDCs, this study analysed the applicability of the German standard “Guidelines for Traffic Signals” (RiLSA, edition 2009) to establish a draft of Guidelines for <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signals</b> in MDCs. In order to achieve the goals and objectives, some contents of RiLSA needed to be modified, in which the minor modifications are directly written in the draft of Guidelines for <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signals</b> in MDCs. This study, therefore, focuses on the major modifications of the intersection layout engineering design, the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> design, and the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control strategies. However, the four criteria: (i) traffic safety, (ii) traffic flow quality, (iii) environmental impacts, and (iv) economics are always considered when modifying any content of RiLSA, in which the first two criteria play an important role in MDCs. And overall, the traffic regulation at <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> has to obey the following priority in order: (i) pedestrians, (ii) cyclists, (iii) public transport, and (iv) motorised traffic. For the intersection layout engineering design, it is necessary to take not only motorised traffic but also public transport, pedestrian traffic, and cycle traffic into account as a whole. However, the layouts for cycle traffic and pedestrian traffic can be applied from RiLSA. Therefore, some modifications on the intersection layouts are implemented for motorised traffic and public transport, in which the major aim is firstly to give priority to public transport, and secondly to give priority to motorcycles in motorised <b>traffic.</b> For the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> elements, unlike some available researches that consider only the equivalent factor converting motorcycles into passenger car units, this study has dealt with a series of the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> elements such as cycle time, green time, amber time, intergreen time, etc., in which a new concept of saturation flow was used. This concept results from the homogeneous motorcycle traffic saturation flow and the homogeneous car traffic saturation flow, and of course this saturation flow depends on the motorcycle traffic volume as well as car traffic volume on the approach. It means that the saturation flow is not fixed as the homogeneous car or motorcycle saturation flow, but it varies depending on the proportion of motorcycles and cars in the traffic flow. From this new concept of the saturation flow, the formulas calculating the cycle time and the green time were formed. For the last two <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> elements, the amber time and the intergreen time were calculated based on the German method in which the positions of the stop-lines, the speeds as well as the deceleration rate of vehicles are taken into account. For the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control strategies, according to RiLSA, there are three macroscopic control levels and three microscopic control levels, in which the microscopic control levels are activated from the macroscopic control levels. However, in MDCs, counting the number of vehicles requires too much effort or it seems to be impossible with conventional technologies. Therefore, only the macroscopic control level “time-dependent <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> selection (A 1) ” can be applied to MDCs. From this macroscopic control level, two microscopic control levels (fixed-time <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> (B 1), and <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> adaption including green time adjustment (B 2), phase swapping (B 3), demand phase (B 4), and time-offset adjustment (B 5)) are activated in MDCs because the fixed-time <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> is always easily implemented, and the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> adaption does not require efforts in counting the number of vehicles. Instead, it only requires detecting vehicles, and this is possible for two-wheel vehicles. The last microscopic control level, the <b>signal</b> <b>program</b> formation (B 6), should not be applied to MDCs because it requires much effort in collecting traffic data online. After having the results for some modifications, a draft of new “Guidelines for <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signal</b> in MDCs” was compiled. It includes six chapters: (0) Introduction, (1) Basic Principles, (2) <b>Signal</b> <b>Program</b> Design, (3) Interrelationships between <b>Traffic</b> <b>Signal</b> Control and Road Engineering Design, (4) Control Strategies, (5) Technical Design. Besides, it also has three annexes: Annex 1 : Details on the Traffic Load, Annex 2 : Traffic Flow Quality, and Annex 3 : Traffic Engineering Calculation.

This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> control models, where each agent in the system is a local <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm.

On average, SignalGuru comes within 0. 66 s, for pre-timed <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> and within 2. 45 s, for traffic-adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signals.</b> Feeding SignalGuru’s predicted traffic schedule to our GLOSA application, our vehicle fuel consumption measurements show savings of 20. 3 %, on average...|$|R
