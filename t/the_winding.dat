30|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is less than <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power is 0; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is between <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be the smooth output; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is between <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and <b>wind</b> power, <b>the</b> prediction distribution of wind power is complex.|$|R
40|$|In this research, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed {{model and}} <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> farm power model is {{developed}} {{and the results}} are estimated and simulated in the MATLAB from the designed algorithm using <b>the</b> historic input <b>wind</b> data. For <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed forecasting, <b>the</b> historic input <b>wind</b> speed data is used to estimate and forecast <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed in advance from <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed models. For <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> farm power model the input to the power model is <b>the</b> historic <b>wind</b> speed, pressure, temperature, wind direction, and air density. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> farm power is determined from the designed algorithm simulated in the MATLAB. [...] The wake effect is considered in <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> farm power model and it depends on <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> direction and <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> farm layout.

5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would play into <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop. The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan, the scenario writer of the company, had retired from the company. As it wound down, the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance. Little is known of the production of this final film, but it was directed by Emile Chautard from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The cameraman was Jacques Bizeul.|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} typical cases: ① When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed {{is less than}} <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed or greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> turbine does not produce <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power. So <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be 0 at the peak, while the rest value is with the smaller probability; ② When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is near <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will {{maintain}} its maximum with the maximum probability. So <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be the maximum value at the peak; ③ When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> distribution of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power output will peak at 0  MW and the rated power.

5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out to replace <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then {{to pass through}} Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
5|$|Harrison, Scott and Mitchell soon {{developed}} a mutual rapport, according to L.A. Express bassist Max Bennett. In addition to carrying out further sessions for Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles, in March 1974, Harrison had begun spending time {{there trying to}} set up his own record label, with <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> down of the Beatles' Apple Records from mid 1973 onwards. In August 1973, rumours in the music industry claimed that Harrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Paul Simon were forming a label together; in fact, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records, one of the first releases of which was the Shankar album, and Dylan temporarily signed with David Geffen's Asylum Records, which was Mitchell's label.|$|E
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out to the spire in 1946–47 under the {{supervision}} of architect Kenneth Dalgleish, following damage sustained during the Second World War. In 1957, the bells were again repaired. On 25 August 1959, the church was added to the register of listed buildings. It is Grade I listed. The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice, rector of Mereworth from 1966–70. A new fibreglass clock face was fitted at this time and <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> mechanism converted to electric power. In 2005, an inspection revealed that the church needed major repairs. English Heritage made a grant that covered 95% of the £500,000 cost of restoration.

5000|$|A sailing craft's {{ability to}} derive power from <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> depends on <b>the</b> point of sail it is on—the {{direction}} of travel under sail in relation to <b>the</b> true <b>wind</b> direction over <b>the</b> surface.

5|$|The highway {{replaced}} a 1912 plank road {{across much}} of Imperial County. <b>The</b> <b>winding</b> two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains {{was one of the}} factors that led to a four-hour journey from San Diego to El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oregon's {{initial state}} highway system, {{the road from}} Grants Pass {{southwest}} to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917. At the time, the Grants Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California. California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state's third highway bond issue, {{as an extension of}} Legislative Route 1. By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito, but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. (Oregon changed the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926, and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill. In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City. One major improvement to the highway's alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie {{to use the money}} from <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E

Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, and a dozen regular soldiers {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged the trenches with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into the trenches and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were to be found in <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, looking on as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E
