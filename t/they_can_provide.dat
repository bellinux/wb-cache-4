5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, absorb {{greenhouse}} gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and {{reduce the risk of}} flooding. It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E
5000|$|An impact vest {{provides}} some protection against impacts to the torso area. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>provide</b> some flotation.|$|R
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>provided</b> <b>they</b> have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|R

5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|Bahamut is very {{stern and}} disapproving of evil. He accepts no excuses for foul deeds. On the other hand, {{he is very}} compassionate, and has {{boundless}} empathy for the weak and downtrodden. He urges his followers to promote good, but to let people fight their own battles when <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>providing</b> healing, information, or temporary safe refuge rather than fighting alongside those who can fight for themselves.|$|R

25|$|Violence {{connected}} to drug smuggling {{on the border}} and in Mexico in general has caused problems with tourism, an important segment of the entire country. Federal troops have been stationed here due to the violence, which has the population divided. While the security <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> is welcomed, there is concern about the violation of human rights. In 2005, the state began advertising campaigns to reassure Arizonans that {{it is safe to}} cross the border.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease. Some athletes {{have said that the}} main advantage to steroids {{is not so much the}} additional power or endurance that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide,</b> but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E
25|$|Magnetostrictive transducers, {{based on}} magnetostriction, have been {{predominantly}} used as sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion {{as in other}} designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC and subwoofer drivers have also been produced.|$|E

25|$|The dive boat {{provides}} a means of transport to and from dive sites which may be too far or inconvenient for shore access. This {{is the case with}} the majority of recreational dive sites. It can also provide a base of operations where the divers can shelter, rest, store and change gear, socialise with other divers, eat and sleep between dives. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> enhanced safety, comfort and convenience, and provide guided access to sites of particular interest. They can also provide access to diving procedures which may be difficult, dangerous or impossible from the shore.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{some of the}} theories, {{like the}} social {{learning}} theory and theory of planned behaviour, were developed as attempts to improve health education. Because these theories address the interaction between individuals and their environments, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> insight into the effectiveness of education programs given {{a specific set of}} predetermined conditions, like the social context in which a program will be initiated. Although health education is still the area in which behavioural change theories are most often applied, theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education.|$|E
25|$|Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Fin Donnelly {{told the}} media that he had hand-delivered their file to Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander earlier this year, but the {{application}} was rejected in June 2015 because it was incomplete. The Kurdi family tried to obtain entry to Canada under a private sponsorship program whereby groups of five people may also sponsor an individual or family. They are required to demonstrate that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> roughly 27,000 Canadian dollars to support {{a family of four}} refugees. According to Alexandra Kotyk, project manager of Lifeline Syria, a refugee settlement group in Toronto, the program requires that people seeking to come to Canada from Turkey first be declared refugees by the Turkish government. She said that was often a difficult or impossible condition to fulfill.|$|E
