A <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> {{makes it possible to}} capture the so-called voltage signal of the magnetic Barkhausen noise that represents mapping of the individual characteristics of the material microstructure. The paper gives a comparison of a classical <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> having the magnetising and detecting sections separated and a compact <b>sensor</b> <b>unit.</b> The aim was to reduce the volume of the passive <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> and possibly increase the accuracy, sensibility and reliability of calibration curves. To this end two compact <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> were developed. The first one consists of a detection coil integrated into a gap of the magnetic yoke. A comparison was made of the results obtained with a compact <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> having an additional ferrite core and a detection section integrated as well in the magnetic yoke.

40|$|The Radio Frequency Health Node (RFHN) {{wireless}} {{sensor system}} differs from other wireless sensor systems in ways {{originally intended to}} enhance utility as an instrumentation system for a spacecraft. The RFHN can also be adapted to use in terrestrial applications {{in which there are}} requirements for operational flexibility and integrability into higher-level instrumentation and data acquisition systems. As shown in the figure, the heart of the system is the RFHN, which is a unit that passes commands and data between (1) one or more commercially available wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> (optionally, also including wired <b>sensor</b> <b>units)</b> and (2) command and data interfaces with a local control computer that may be part of the spacecraft or other engineering system in which the wireless sensor system is installed. In turn, the local control computer can be in radio or wire communication with a remote control computer that may be part of a higher-level system. The remote control computer, acting via the local control computer and the RFHN, cannot only monitor readout data from the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> but can also remotely configure (program or reprogram) the RFHN and the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> during operation. In a spacecraft application, the RFHN and the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> can also be configured more nearly directly, prior to launch, via a serial interface that includes an umbilical cable between the spacecraft and ground support equipment. In either case, the RFHN wireless sensor system has the flexibility to be configured, as required, with different numbers and types of sensors for different applications. The RFHN can be used to effect realtime transfer of data from, and commands to, the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units.</b> It can also store data for later retrieval by an external computer. The RFHN communicates with the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> via a radio transceiver module.

This current study developed a small <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> comprising an accelerometer and a gyroscope in order to detect shank and foot segment motion and orientation during different walking conditions. The kinematic data obtained in the pre-swing phase were used to classify five walking conditions: stair ascent, stair descent, level ground, upslope and downslope. The kinematic data consisted of anterior-posterior acceleration and angular velocity measured from the shank and foot segments. A machine learning technique known as support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify the walking conditions. SVM was also compared with other machine learning methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), radial basis function network (RBF) and Bayesian belief network (BBN). The SVM technique was shown to have a higher performance in classification than the other three methods. The results using SVM showed that stair ascent and stair descent could be distinguished from each other and from the other walking conditions with 100 % accuracy by using a single <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> attached to the shank segment.

[...] University of Washington, 2014 A new {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} (SHM) system, {{which consists of}} a piezoelectric drive and a ferroelectric-based <b>sensor</b> <b>unit,</b> is proposed. Unlike the current SHM system, the proposed SHM system has only a <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> and a drive unit, a low-power source to operate the system, and requires no heavy weight memory unit to record data. For the ferroelectric-film-based <b>sensor</b> <b>unit,</b> a polarization fatigue measurement system is developed and a numerous sets of polarization fatigue tests on ferroelectric films with millions of repetitions are conducted. The polarization fatigue data of the ferroelectric thin films provide the reduction of their polarization under {{a certain number of}} cyclic electric fields. For the drive unit, a bulk piezoelectric ceramic is mounted on a structural component sending out voltage, which is induced by the deformation on the structural component. By electrically connecting the drive <b>unit</b> to the <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> and an interface circuit in between, we utilize the polarization fatigue data of ferroelectric-film-based <b>sensor</b> <b>unit</b> to record only a critical number of cycles of a dynamic load history of larger magnitudes.
