2500|$|The <b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>Test</b> (also {{known as}} the TAT) {{involves}} presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them {{to tell a story}} based on what they see. Common examples of these [...] "scenes" [...] include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or {{a man and a woman}} in a bedroom. Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.|$|E
50|$|Links {{have also}} been {{established}} between violence in childhood and likelihood of uxoricide occurring. Psyschodynamic researchers argue that being the victim of abuse in childhood leads to being a perpetrator of domestic abuse in adulthood via the route of defense mechanisms - in this case, violence is an unconscious defensive adaption to childhood trauma and other adverse events. Other psychodynamic researchers have reported that <b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>tests</b> reveal significant trends of rejection by a mother or wife in men who commit uxoricide. Psychoanalytic dream interpretation has also argued that unconscious conflict manifests into violent outbursts. For example, in one instance one man had experienced and recorded over 200 distressing, mostly violent dreams prior to murdering his wife.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether there is a difference in communication between parents and adolescents in restructured and structured families. To supplement the literature, two groups of adolescents were given questionnaires on parent child communication. The experimental group was from restructured families while the control group was from structured families. An in depth study through interviews and <b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>Tests</b> was done. Furthermore, the researcher supported her study by exploring case studies, group therapy sessions and some sessions during her years of internship. Besides the fact that there was no significant difference in communication between these groups, language as a factor in communication seemed to have a significant impact. In the eight moments (criteria) under which the questions of the questionnaire were categorized, it came out that good communication is not dependent on the structure of the family but on the interaction of individuals within any family.

40|$|A LL doctors {{recognize}} that personality factors {{are important in}} producing a patient's illness record. Even in organic illness, personality may {{play a part in}} deciding the patient's behaviour. This is an important if secondary factor in deciding the course of the disease and its treatment. In psychiatric illness personality plays a leading part. The emotional background of the neuroses has been studied in depth but the disease process and the patient's inherent stability or lack of stability are treated as one factor. Thus a neurotic has become a person with a neurosis rather than a person with inherent emotional instability. This would not matter but it leads to misdiagnosing disease in people who are not really ill. Unlike neuroticism other personality traits are often overlooked, thus extraversion, introversion, rigidity and social adaptability are seldom considered in the detail that they deserve. The lack of objective, clear, and easily applied measures for personality traits may explain some of this. For example, Rorschach <b>testing</b> and <b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>tests</b> require both time and expertise and are unsuitable for frequent use under condition...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>Tests</b> {{are meant}} to evoke an {{involuntary}} display of one’s subconscious. There is no standardization for evaluating one’s TAT responses; each evaluation is completely subjective because each response is unique. Validity and reliability are, consequently, the largest question marks of the TAT. There are trends and patterns, which help identify psychological traits, {{but there are no}} distinct responses to indicate different conditions a patient may or may not have. Medical professionals most commonly use it {{in the early stages of}} patient treatment. The TAT helps professionals identify a broad range of issues that their patients may suffer from. Even when individual scoring procedures are examined, the absence of standardization or norms make it difficult to compare the results of validity and reliability research across studies. Specifically, even studies using the same scoring system often use different cards, or a different number of cards. Standardization is also absent amongst clinicians, who often alter the instructions and procedures. Murstein explained that different cards may be more or less useful for specific clinical questions and purposes, making the use of one set of cards for all clients impractical.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between state-anxiety and affective expressions in written stories, and receiving or withholding a sad movie and receiving permission to cry in appropriate contexts. Subjects consisted of 124 undergraduate males and females, as well as 34 older males, members of 5 midwestern, nationally affiliated civic clubs. Two independent measures, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form X- 1 Only, and selected plates of the <b>Thematic</b> <b>Apperception</b> <b>Tests,</b> were utilized. Four null hypotheses were tested by using separate one-way analysis of variance with an alpha level of. 05 for rejection. Findings 1. Older males scored significantly higher on state anxiety following a sad movie and cry behaviors than undergraduate males. 2. Older males scored significantly higher on post-test measures of state-anxiety than on pre-test measures following a sad movie and cry behaviors. 3. Undergraduate males are significantly more skilled in expressing affect in written stories than are older males. 4. Older males showed significantly greater gains from pre- to post- test scores in affective skills. 5. Performances of females in the study revealed that, in contrast to male scores, females performed at a significantly higher level in affective expression skills than either of the two male groups. Further, female state-anxiety scores were significantly lower in a sad movie only context, than were their scores for other treatment modalitities. Conclusions 1. A target population of older males described in the literature as stereotypically rigid and emotionally constricted, are more emotionally expressive following a sad movie and self-permitted cry behaviors. 2.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 67 - 69) Limited research {{exists in}} the cross-cultural assessment of personality. Standard personality tests tend not to provide culturally congruent material; thematic material portraying only Anglo characters is often used for members of other cultures and/or ethnic groups. The validity of these tests in such circumstances has repeatedly been questioned. The present study {{is an attempt to}} remedy this situation through the use of sociolinguistic analysis. It deals with the speech patterns of some Black children and adolescents who were administered the Black and White series of a <b>test</b> (Roberts <b>Apperception</b> Test For Children) which aims at discovering whether or not subjects identify more with stimulus material depicting their own ethnicity. The first chapter provides a historical examination of <b>thematic</b> <b>apperception</b> <b>tests</b> from early techniques to the recently developed Roberts Apperception Test For Children (RATC), one of the few tests to provide culturally congruent stimuli for Black Americans. It is followed by a discussion of previous research relating to test administration cross-culturally. The next section consists of a description of selected features of the Black English Vernacular (BEV), as well as a summary of previous sociolinguistic findings which show correlations between the use of BEV on the one hand, familiarity and/or identification with an individual or ethnic group on the other hand. In this study forty-eight Black children and adolescents divided into four equal groups were administered either the Black or White series of the RATC, then the opposite series four weeks later. The verbal responses were analyzed statistically (AN OVA) and qualitatively for occurrences of BEV and features associated with colloquial speech. A tendency emerged towards an increased use of BEV and colloquial features by the child subjects when the Black test series was administered, compared to the White series. A statistically significant increase in the use of BEV and features associated with colloquial speech by the adolescent subjects was also found (0. 05 level) when they were administered the Black series, compared to the White series. These sociolinguistic findings clearly indicate that Black children and adolescents do tend to identify more with the Black series of the RATC than they do with the White series. One might therefore consider generalizing the use of such cross-cultural test material in the evaluation of people from different cultures and ethnic groups...|$|R

50|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus is {{generally}} credited with developing {{the first sentence}} completion test in 1897. Ebbinghaus's sentence completion test was used {{as part of an}} intelligence test.

Moreover, in recent decades, sentence completion tests have increased in usage, in part because they are easy to develop and easy to administer. As of the 1980s, sentence completion tests were the eighty-fifth most widely used personality assessment instruments. Another reason for the increased usage of sentence completion tests is because of their superiority to other measures in uncovering conflicted attitudes.
