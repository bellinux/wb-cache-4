5|$|Two {{centuries before}} Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the help}} of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been closely held. Before his death in 1779, Cook hypothesized that Polynesians shared common ancestry; he even pinned their origin to Asia. However, Cook's theory did not prevent debate among scholars. Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E
5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> never have caught them. Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E
5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

Approximately {{one third}} of this book is a long {{discussion}} by Suzuki that gives a Buddhist analysis of the mind, its levels, and the methodology of extending awareness beyond the merely discursive level of thought. In producing this analysis, Suzuki gives a theoretical explanation {{for many of the}} swordsmanship teaching stories in Zen and Japanese Culture <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> seem to involve mental telepathy, extrasensory perception, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Usually when economists use {{the term}} [...] "crowding out" [...] they are {{referring}} to the government spending using up financial and other resources <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> be used by private enterprise.

25|$|The {{actual number}} of {{complete}} or partial weeks of Ordinary Time {{in any given year}} can total 33 or 34. In most years, Ordinary Time comprises only 33 weeks, so the Church omits one week <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> precede the resumption of Ordinary Time following Pentecost Sunday. For example, in 2011, the Sunday before Ash Wednesday was the Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time, but the day after Pentecost Sunday began the 11th Week in Ordinary Time.|$|E

For example, by {{advancing}} towards the prey to less than the jumping distance, then retreating and leaping in an arc {{at the end of the}} tether line, many species can leap onto prey on vertical or even on inverted surfaces, which of course in a gravitational field would not be possible without such a tether.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
25|$|ESPN2 aired {{a handful}} of NBA regular season games from 2002 to 2006, {{typically}} in January, when prime time golf tournaments preempted coverage on ESPN. On several occasions, ESPN2 would air {{the first game of}} a doubleheader, while ESPN air the second game. Starting with the 2006-2007 season, regular season games on ESPN2 were discontinued. During the playoffs, ESPN2 airs games <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> not have appeared on any outlet other than NBA TV, mostly on Friday nights and only during the first round.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{from the}} status-class term Intelligentsia, sociologists derived the term mass intelligentsia to {{describe}} the populations of educated adults, with discretionary income, who pursue intellectual interests by way of book clubs and cultural associations, etc. That sociological term was made popular usage by the writer Melvyn Bragg, who said that mass intelligentsia conceptually explains the popularity of book clubs and literary festivals <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been of limited intellectual interests to most people from {{the middle class and}} from the working class.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, this duty can be {{discharged}} by advising the client {{of the consequences}} in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public. As a result, whistleblowing by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have prevented the engineer from speaking out.|$|E

By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test-run <b>that</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> require several times the reagents and more time to perform.
