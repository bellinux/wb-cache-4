5|$|A disappointing opening {{sequence}} of the 1980–81 season was followed by six wins in six games in September, and Bremner won his second Manager of the Month award. The good results continued {{for the rest of}} the campaign, and Rovers were promoted in third place. He signed Celtic's Colin Douglas for the challenge of Third Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third Division Manager of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. Results again picked up with only two defeats in the last 14 games, and they ended the campaign in 19th spot, three points above the relegation zone.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested.

5|$|The Bulldogs beat Richmond AC 39–0 in {{the final}} game of the season. Richmond AC {{was not part of the}} APFA, and this was the team's only game in 1920.

5|$|Cross Generation of Heroes, the 2008 Wii {{version of}} Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, has an Arcade game mode: the player fights against {{artificial}} intelligence (AI)-controlled opponents {{to reach the}} final boss character, Yami from Ōkami. Time attack and Survival modes are also available, and require the player to defeat every character in the game. While Survival limits health regeneration, Time attack challenges players <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shortest time possible. Other modes include Vs. Mode, in which two players engage in combat, and Original Games, which sees up to four players competing in character-specific minigames. Using money obtained throughout the game, the player may purchase unlockable characters, alternate character costumes, minigames, character profiles, movies, illustrations, and background music. Once purchased, the latter four are viewable in a gallery. The arcade release of Cross Generation of Heroes omits the game modes, and instead features a character selection screen from which a player may compete against either AI opponents or a second player.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998 season, Burns {{recorded}} similar batting averages to {{the previous}} season, but was rarely used as a bowler. Wisden noted that he played some good first-class innings, but needed to be more consistent; an improvement he made in 1999. That following year, Burns achieved a batting average in excess of thirty for the first time, and scored the maiden century of his first-class career. Facing Leicestershire, who had not lost in the County Championship for 21 months, Burns scored 109, and shared a 244-run partnership with Peter Bowler to help Somerset to victory by 9 wickets. His second century that season came in a defeat to Worcestershire; chasing 316 runs <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth innings, Somerset were reduced to 56 for three. Burns played an attacking innings, hitting 105 runs from 103 deliveries to give his side a chance of victory, but Worcestershire eventually won by 26 runs.|$|E
5|$|Macartney had a {{moderately}} successful debut. He bowled three wicketless overs {{in the first}} innings, before scoring 35 in Australia's reply while batting at No. 7. He took one wicket, that of leading English batsman Wilfred Rhodes. With Australia needing 274 runs <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings, Noble decided that Macartney's first innings effort warranted promotion to act as Trumper's opening partner. He managed to score only nine, but Australia managed to scrape home to seal a two wicket victory. Macartney's domestic form after his Test debut was sufficient for him to retain his position for the Second Test in Melbourne. Noble persevered with Macartney as Trumper's opening partner and he scored 37 of an 84 run opening partnership in the first innings. He returned to the middle order in the second innings to score 54 and took a total of 1/55 as England squared the series with a narrow one wicket victory.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, {{pitching}} the Giants' home opener, Cain threw {{a complete}} game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 innings, {{one over the}} minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the third one-hitter of Cain's career. In his next start, on April 18, Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th inning. Following a dominant first half, Cain was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager Tony La Russa to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision. On July 21, Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels {{in the third inning}} of a 10-inning, 65 Giants' victory. Later in that inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley {{was unhappy with}} his captain's manner, feeling humiliated at his {{treatment}} in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match. The home team's fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put up a very good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1–0. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out {{in three of the}} innings. At the beginning of the following season, Wisden's editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead the side to Australia, and only Percy Chapman's lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine's expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in Wisden's opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94.|$|E
