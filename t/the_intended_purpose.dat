5|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent, {{except that it was}} not for <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purpose,</b> and {{the government}} has failed to honour requests to return the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is situated}} near the Tomb of Sikandar Lodhi and Shisha Gumbad. Although the three structures, which {{share a common}} raised platform, were all built during the Lodhi reign, they were not constructed at the same time. <b>The</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of the builders of Bara Gumbad is unclear: {{it may have been}} intended as a free-standing tomb, but no tombstone has been identified. The area in which Bara Gumbad is situated was formally called Khairpur village.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} records of {{construction}} or <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of Borobudur. The duration of construction {{has been estimated}} by comparison of carved reliefs on the temple's hidden foot and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Borobudur was likely founded around 800 CE. This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830CE, {{the peak of the}} Sailendra dynasty rule of Mataram kingdom in central Java, when it was {{under the influence of the}} Srivijayan Empire. The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years with completion during the reign of Samaratungga in 825.|$|E

50|$|East Lynn Lake was {{originally}} {{authorized by the}} U.S. Congress in 1938 following the devastating Flood of 1937. Like many other projects authorized in this era, construction did not actually take place until much later. Construction occurred about 1969-1970 with <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purposes</b> of flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. East Lynn Lake was established as the project's official name in 1971.|$|R

25|$|The Chinook writing, or Wawa shorthand, was {{developed}} by Father Jean-Marie-Raphaël Le Jeune in the early 1890s for writing in Chinook Jargon, Lillooet, Thompson, Okanagan, and English, with <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of bringing literacy and church teaching to the first nations in the Catholic Diocese of Kamloops.

In a quarter of an hour, most of that part of the stern which was within five or six feet of the tafferel, rose above the water, coming fairly in view.|$|R

25|$|The colonies {{depended}} on Britain for many finished goods, partly because laws prohibited making {{many types of}} finished goods in the colonies. These laws achieved <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of creating a trade surplus for Britain. The colonial balance trade in goods was heavily in favor of Britain; however, American shippers were able to offset roughly half of the goods trade deficit with revenues earned by shipping between ports within the British Empire.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} {{arrangement of}} a microprocessor {{varies depending on}} {{the age of the}} design and <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purposes</b> of <b>the</b> microprocessor.

Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture.|$|R
