40|$|The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement {{describes}} {{a method of}} evaluating measurement uncertainty that involves attributing an underlying variance to each component of the total measurement error. Assessment of such a variance by statistical methods is known as <b>Type</b> A <b>evaluation</b> of uncertainty, while assessment by any other means is known as <b>Type</b> B <b>evaluation.</b> The involvement of degrees of freedom with <b>Type</b> A <b>evaluation</b> is in accordance with statistical theory. However, the use of “degrees of freedom” with <b>Type</b> B <b>evaluation</b> is an idea primarily developed for practicality, and might be improved upon. That idea {{ignores the fact that}} the underlying distribution of the corresponding error will often be assumed to be blunter than normal, as with a uniform distribution, and it can lead to underestimation of the total error variance. Consequently, an alternative concept for <b>Type</b> B <b>evaluation</b> is presented. The resulting analysis fits easily with the use of degrees of freedom in <b>Type</b> A <b>evaluation</b> and leads to an overall method of evaluation that often permits the proper quotation of shorter uncertainty intervals...|$|R

The survey involved 119 teachers from 12 primary schools in the Gorenjska region.

The majority of interviewed teachers taught physical education in the school year 2011 - 2012 and agree with the evaluation of physical education. For the most appropriate <b>type</b> of <b>evaluation</b> in the first triad the majority agreed on descriptive evaluation and in the second triad numerical evaluation stands out.

40|$|Clustering is {{a central}} {{technique}} in NLP. Consequently, clustering evaluation is of great importance. Many clustering algorithms are evaluated by their success in tagging corpus tokens. In this paper we discuss <b>type</b> level <b>evaluation,</b> which reflects class membership only and is independent of the token statistics of a particular reference corpus. <b>Type</b> level <b>evaluation</b> casts light {{on the merits of}} algorithms, and for some applications is a more natural measure of the algorithm’s quality. We propose new <b>type</b> level <b>evaluation</b> measures that, contrary to existing measures, are applicable when items are polysemous, the common case in NLP. We demonstrate the benefits of our measures using a detailed case study, POS induction. We experiment with seven leading algorithms, obtaining useful insights and showing that token and type level measures can weakly or even negatively correlate, which underscores the fact that these two approaches reveal different aspects of clustering quality. ...|$|R

40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. Spontaneous reinnervation after diaphragmatic {{paralysis}} due to trauma, surgery, tumors and {{spinal cord injuries}} is frequently observed. A possible explanation could be collateral reinnervation, since the diaphragm is commonly double-innervated by the (accessory) phrenic nerve. Permutation entropy (PeEn), a complexity measure for time series, may reflect a functional state of neuromuscular transmission by quantifying the complexity of interactions across neural and muscular networks. In an established rat model, electromyographic signals of the diaphragm after phrenicotomy were analyzed using PeEn quantifying denervation and reinnervation. Thirty-three anesthetized rats were unilaterally phrenicotomized. After 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81 days, diaphragmatic electromyographic PeEn was analyzed in vivo from sternal, mid-costal and crural areas of both hemidiaphragms.
