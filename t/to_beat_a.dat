However, {{the morning after}} his 19th win, a shutout in which he struck out 13 batters, he could not straighten his arm. He was diagnosed by Dodgers' team physician Robert Kerlan with traumatic arthritis. With the Dodgers out of the pennant race, the book was closed on Koufax and his 19–5 record.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue {{became the}} first {{computer}} chess-playing system <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. The super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by IBM, and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match (which Deep Blue had lost), reportedly 200,000,000 moves per second. The event was broadcast live over the internet and received over 74 million hits.|$|E
5|$|Relegation {{meant that}} 2009–10 saw Luton {{playing in the}} Conference Premier, a {{competition}} which the club had never before participated in. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the 2012–13 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> side from England's top division since 1989. In the 2013–14 season, under the management of John Still, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured {{a return to the}} Football League from 2014–15.|$|E

It stands as the biggest upset in the tournament's history, {{especially}} considering the Timbers featured their regular starting lineup.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E

25|$|Alec Stewart {{took the}} reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI {{captaincy}} in 1999.

25|$|The {{first test}} of the Test series was also under threat of a player strike but ZC made sure a team was fielded for the Test.

The event was abolished from the Olympic program so Meares could not defend her title in 2008.|$|E

25|$|The first Minor County <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> {{first-class}} {{county in}} the Gillette Cup was Durham: in 1973, the county beat Yorkshire at Harrogate by five wickets. In all, 10 Minor Counties sides beat first-class opposition up to 2005 (and three other sides, Ireland, Scotland and Holland, also beat first-class counties). Minor County involvement in the competition ended after the 2005 season when the Cup changed to a league format for first-class counties (plus Ireland and Scotland) only.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 21st century, AI {{began to be}} used for logistics, data mining, medical {{diagnosis}} and other areas. The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov on 11 May 1997.|$|E
25|$|The INA {{marched to}} Burma with the Japanese army in December 1944, but by March 1945, with {{the tide of}} war turning against them, the INA {{leadership}} decided <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> retreat before they could enter Imphal. Captain Lakshmi was arrested by the British army in May 1945, remaining in Burma until March 1946, when she was sent to India – {{at a time when}} the INA trials in Delhi heightened popular discontent with and hastened the end of colonial rule.|$|E

25|$|ChessGenius is a {{continuation}} of a series of programs (which included various incarnations of the Mephisto program) written by Richard Lang which won the World Microcomputer Chess Championship in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993. ChessGenius was the first computer <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> world champion (Garry Kasparov) at a non-blitz time limit. This victory was particularly significant because in contrast to the victory two years later by Deep Blue which was running on very fast custom-built hardware, ChessGenius was running on only an early Pentium PC.|$|E
25|$|During the 1999 season, the Letran Knights were mentored by Binky Favis, {{who later}} coached the Coca Cola Tigers.

In 1999, the Stags {{attempted}} to win their sixth consecutive title, but the Letran Knights, helped by Kerby Raymundo and Chris Calaguio, and coached by Louie Alas, denied them this honor and took the championship for themselves after 12 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{seventeen}} first-class counties, {{were joined}} by five Minor Counties: Bedfordshire, Dorset, Durham, Staffordshire and Wiltshire. Teams who won {{in the first round}} progressed to the second round. The winners in the second round then progressed to the quarter-final stage. Winners from the quarter-finals then progressed to the semi-finals from which the winners then went on to the final at Lord's which was held on 1 September 1973. The tournament was notable for Durham (then a minor county) defeating Yorkshire. In doing so, Durham became the first ever minor county <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>a</b> first class county in this competition.|$|E
25|$|Durham CCC {{was founded}} as an {{official}} entity on 23 May 1882, and the nascent club played its first competitive match on 12 June of that year, beating Northumberland by 4 wickets at the Ashbrooke Ground, Sunderland.

25|$|Robert de Thorigny, a great {{supporter}} of HenryII of England (who was also Duke of Normandy), reinforced {{the structure of}} the buildings and built the main façade of the church in the 12th century.
