40|$|The angular {{momentum}} of the Kerr singularity should not be larger than a threshold value {{so that it is}} enclosed by an event horizon: The Kerr singularity with the {{angular momentum}} exceeding the threshold value is naked. This fact suggests that if the cosmic censorship exists in our Universe, an over-spinning body without releasing its angular momentum cannot collapse to spacetime singularities. A simple kinematical estimate of two particles approaching each other supports this expectation and suggests the existence of a minimum size of an over-spinning body. But this does not imply that the geometry near the naked singularity cannot appear. By analyzing initial data, i. e., a snapshot of a spinning body, we see that an over-spinning body may produce a geometry close to the Kerr naked singularity around itself at least as a <b>transient</b> <b>configuration.</b> Comment: 30 pages, 8 figures, the version published in PR...|$|E

40|$|This {{work offers}} an {{approach}} to obtain and interpret quantitative data on silicon by innovating the field of micro-spectroscopy in the theoretical, methodical and technical regime. By introducing the time domain into micro-spectroscopy on silicon, a conceptual advance was achieved: the immediacy of approaching the charge carrier lifetime within a transient decay proves to be a robust and reliable technique. The sensible interpretation of data acquired with this approach becomes feasible due to a thorough theoretical treatment of the charge carrier dynamics taking place in a <b>transient</b> <b>configuration.</b> The elaborated 'intensity weighted' formalism reveals to be of importance {{not only for the}} specific approach of time resolved micro-spectroscopy on silicon, but for any means deducing a quantity from a non-uniform distribution of the particles investigated.

In the present study, we employed classical Molecular Dynamics simulations {{to search for}} the presence of <b>transient</b> <b>configurations</b> that enable proton transfer, or proton sharing, between adjacent carboxylate groups on the protein surface.

These networks do not extend out of the common Coulomb cage of the participating residues and the lifetimes of the bridged structures are sufficiently long to allow passage of a proton between the carboxylates. The detection of domains capable of supporting a rapid proton transfer on a protein supports the notion that clusters of carboxylates are the operative elements of proton collecting antennae, as in bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome c oxidase or the photosynthetic reaction center...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of gas exchange requires coordination of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Previous work suggested that medullary raphe neurones transform and transmit information from baroreceptors to neurones in the ventral respiratory group. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} distributed brainstem neuronal assemblies are transiently reconfigured during the respiratory cycle and baroreceptor stimulation. Blood pressure was perturbed by intravenous injection of an α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist, unilateral pressure changes in the carotid sinus, or occlusion of the descending aorta in 14 Dial-urethane anaesthetized, vagotomized, paralysed, artificially ventilated cats. Neurones were monitored simultaneously with microelectrode arrays in {{two or more of}} the following sites: n. raphe obscurus, n. raphe magnus, rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla, and the nucleus tractus solitarii. <b>Transient</b> <b>configurations</b> of baroresponsive assemblies were detected with joint pericycle-triggered histograms, the gravitational representation, and related pattern detection methods. Data were also analysed with cycle-triggered histograms, peristimulus-time and cumulative sum histograms, cross-correlograms, spike-triggered averages of efferent phrenic activity, and joint impulse configuration scatter diagrams (snowflakes). Five to nine simultaneously recorded spike trains from control expiratory phases were compared with data from interleaved equal-duration time blocks from control inspiratory phases. In each of seven animals, significant impulse synchrony detected by gravity analysis was confined to one phase of the respiratory cycle. Repeated patterns of distributed synchrony confined to periods of altered baroreceptor activity were detected and involved neurones that individually did not change firing rates during stimulation. Snowflakes and logical cross-correlation analysis provided evidence for the cooperative actions of impulses in concurrently active parallel channels. In 12 of 17 pairs of neurones with at least one baroresponsive cell, joint pericycle-triggered histograms detected synchrony indicative of shared inputs or functional excitatory interactions that varied as a function of time in the respiratory cycle. Neurones in four of the pairs had no respiratory modulation of their individual firing rates. Data from eight other pairs were indicative of fluctuations in inhibition during the respiratory cycle. The results demonstrate repeated <b>transient</b> <b>configurations</b> of baroresponsive neuronal assemblies during the respiratory cycle, without concomitant firing rate changes in the constituent neurones, and suggest distributed network mechanisms for the modulation of baroreceptor-mediated reflexes...|$|R

40|$|The Iceland hotspot has profoundly {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} oceanic crust throughout the North Atlantic basin. Enigmatically, the geographic extent of the hotspot influence along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has been asymmetric {{for most of the}} spreading history. This asymmetry is evident in crustal thickness along the present-day ridge system and anomalously shallow seafloor of ages ∼ 49 – 25 Ma created at the Reykjanes Ridge (RR), SSW of the hotspot center, compared to deeper seafloor created by the now-extinct Aegir Ridge (AR) the same distance NE of the hotspot center. The cause of this asymmetry is explored with 3 -D numerical models that simulate a mantle plume interacting with the ridge system using realistic ridge geometries and spreading rates that evolve from continental breakup to present-day. The models predict plume-influence to be symmetric at continental breakup, then to rapidly contract along the ridges, resulting in widely influenced margins next to uninfluenced oceanic crust. After this initial stage, varying degrees of asymmetry along the mature ridge segments are predicted. Models in which the lithosphere is created by the stiffening of the mantle due to the extraction of water near the base of the melting zone predict a moderate amount of asymmetry; the plume expands NE along the AR ∼ 70 – 80 % as far as it expands SSW along the RR. Without dehydration stiffening, the lithosphere corresponds to the near-surface, cool, thermal boundary layer; in these cases, the plume is predicted to be even more asymmetric, expanding only 40 – 50 % as far along the AR as it does along the RR. Estimates of asymmetry and seismically measured crustal thicknesses are best explained by model predictions of an Iceland plume volume flux of ∼ 100 – 200 m^ 3 /s, and a lithosphere controlled by a rheology in which dehydration stiffens the mantle, but to a lesser degree than simulated here.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a quantum {{transport}} model for the selectivity filter in the KcsA potassium ion channel. This model is fully consistent {{with the fact that}} two conduction pathways are involved in the translocation of ions thorough the filter, and we show that the presence of a second path may actually bring advantages for the filter as a result of quantum interference. To highlight interferences and resonances in the model, we consider the selectivity filter to be driven by a controlled time-dependent external field which changes the free energy scenario and consequently the conduction of the ions. In particular, we demonstrate that the two-pathway conduction mechanism is more advantageous for the filter when dephasing in the <b>transient</b> <b>configurations</b> is lower than in the main configurations. As a matter of fact, K$^+$ ions in the main configurations are highly coordinated by oxygen atoms of the filter backbone and this increases noise.

40|$|We study numerically and {{analytically}} the coarsening of stripe phases in two spatial dimensions, {{and show}} that <b>transient</b> <b>configurations</b> do not achieve long ranged orientational order but rather evolve into glassy configurations with very slow dynamics. In the absence of thermal fluctuations, defects such as grain boundaries become pinned in an effective periodic potential that is induced by the underlying periodicity of the stripe pattern itself. Pinning arises without quenched disorder from the non-adiabatic coupling between the slowly varying envelope of the order parameter around a defect, and its fast variation over the stripe wavelength. The characteristic size of ordered domains asymptotes to a finite value R_g ∼λ_ 0 ϵ^- 1 / 2 (|a|/√(ϵ)), where ϵ≪ 1 is the dimensionless distance away from threshold, λ_ 0 the stripe wavelength, and a a constant of order unity. Random fluctuations allow defect motion to resume until a new characteristic scale is reached, function of {{the intensity of the}} fluctuations.

40|$|The nearby star Fomalhaut {{harbours}} a cold, moderately eccentric dust {{belt with}} a sharp inner edge near 133 au. A low-mass, common proper motion companion (Fom b), was discovered near the inner edge and {{was identified as a}} planet candidate that could account for the belt morphology. However, the most recent orbit determination based on four epochs of astrometry over eight years reveals a highly eccentric orbit that appears to cross the belt in the sky plane projection. We perform here a full orbital determination based on the available astrometric data to independently validate the orbit estimates previously presented. Adopting our values for the orbital elements and their associated uncertainties, we then study the dynamical interaction between the planet and the dust ring, to check whether the proposed disk sculpting scenario by Fom b is plausible. We used a dedicated MCMC code to derive the statistical distributions of the orbital elements of Fom b. Then we used symplectic N-body integration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a single planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom b. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our results are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find that the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the belt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If coplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that the observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar eccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally aligned with the planet. This <b>transient</b> <b>configuration</b> only occurs a short time after the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular disk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is in any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long the observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as a function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b is likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the sculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive, less eccentric planet companion Fom c.

Trying to fill this lack of knowledge, previous numerical studies of transient solutions by the authors are re-examined and compared with numerical steady-state solutions at different ambient conditions. Moreover, the numerical and experimental data published in the meantime are discussed and compared with the present numerical simulations. The analysis allows to establish the main features of these flowfields, and to indicate important differences between steady and <b>transient</b> flow <b>configurations...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel imaging technique adopting remote focusing for resolving the axial dynamics in the director field for liquid crystals. The high axial time resolution of our approach {{is demonstrated by}} imaging directly {{the evolution of the}} director field for an initially splayed nematic layer subject to a sudden voltage pulse. Images of the switching dynamics are presented, revealing <b>transient</b> state director <b>configurations</b> and changes in topology of the liquid crystal layer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, a {{relaxation}} {{term was}} added to the convective boundary condition to increase the accuracy of the transient bound water diffusion modeling in wood. The implemented term accounts for a relaxation time constant in the equilibrium moisture content. The inverse finite element analysis approach was used to determine the values of all coefficients of the modified diffusion model. This procedure was performed for beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) in the radial and longitudinal directions. The experimental data obtained by Perré et al. (2007) for <b>transient</b> diffusion <b>configurations</b> were used here. The accurate control of moist air parameters and the improved procedure for mass measurements of a sample during sorption experiments were used. The influence of the modification of the boundary condition on accuracy of diffusion modeling was analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} ab-initio {{study on the}} energy configurations, minimum energy path (MEP), and {{migration}} energy of neutral indium atom during diffusion in silicon crystal. From the ab-initio calculation of electronic structure, we could figure out the <b>transient</b> atomistic <b>configurations</b> during the indium diffusion in silicon. We found that the lowest-energy structure (Ins + Sii Td) consists of indium sitting on a substitutional site for stabilizing a silicon self-interstitial in a nearby tetrahedral position. The second lowest-energy structure {{was found to be}} Ini Td, the interstitial indium at the tetrahedral position. We employed the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method for estimating the MEP between the two local energy minima and the migration energy of the neutral indium, and obtained the MEP of 0. 79 eV...|$|R
