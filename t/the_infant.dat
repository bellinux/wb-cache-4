5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to <b>the</b> <b>infant.</b> Anxious-avoidant attachment is when <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E

5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young.

The mother will carry <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study focuses {{attention}} on maternal nutrition and stress as possible reasons for excess black infant mortality after exploring lower <b>infant</b> mortality for <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of foreign-born black mothers compared to native-born black mothers. METHODS: All births to non-Hispanic {{black women in}} New York City from 1988 - 1992 were examined and <b>infant</b> mortality for <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of native-born women was compared to <b>infant</b> mortality for <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of foreign-born women. RESULTS: Before controlling for potential confounders on the birth certificate, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of native-born black women had {{a greater risk of}} <b>infant</b> mortality than <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of foreign-born black women: OR = 1. 48 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 38, 1. 58). After controlling for potential confounders, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of native-born black women still had a greater risk of <b>infant</b> mortality than <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> of foreign-born black women: OR(a) = 1. 32 (95 % Cl = 1. 21, 1. 43).

5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation and discipline that would {{have a major impact on}} Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> James VI.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the immune {{responses}} of newborns with congenital Chagas disease (CCD) or congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) but they probably differ to those seen in adults with Chagas disease or toxoplasmosis, leading to differences in pathology. The concentrations of interleukin- 18 (IL- 18), interferon-c (IFN-c) and interleukin 10 (IL- 10) in <b>the</b> sera of <b>infants</b> with CCD or CT were recently determined and compared with those in the sera of uninfected controls (born to mothers who were seropositive or seronegative for Trypanosoma cruzi). <b>The</b> <b>infants</b> with CCD or CT were found to have lower IL- 18 and IFN-c concentrations but higher IL- 10 concentrations than the uninfected controls. The IL- 18 and IFN-c concentrations were also significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> with CCD than in those with CT. Although <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> with symptomatic CT had significantly higher serum concentrations of IL- 18 than those with asymptomatic infection with Toxoplasma, <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> with symptomatic CCD had similar serum concentrations of IL- 18 to <b>the</b> <b>infants</b> with asymptomatic Tr. cruzi infection.

5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born.

When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of <b>the</b> <b>infant</b> with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus not a part of <b>the</b> <b>infant,</b> but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
