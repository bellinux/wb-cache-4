25|$|Arsenical bronze is an alloy {{in which}} arsenic {{is added to}} copper as opposed to, or in {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> or other constituent metals, to make bronze. The use of arsenic with copper, either as the secondary constituent or with another component such as tin, results in a stronger final product and better casting behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Tin is {{the usual}} main {{structural}} metal of the alloy. It has good strength and wetting. On its own it is prone <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> pest, tin cry, and growth of tin whiskers. Readily dissolves silver, gold and to less but still significant extent many other metals, e.g. copper; this is a particular concern for tin-rich alloys with higher melting points and reflow temperatures.|$|E
50|$|A 10% {{solution}} of fluoroboric acid, tin fluoroborate and thiourea is used <b>to</b> immersion <b>tin</b> plate the copper traces of {{printed circuit boards}} for protection and easier soldering. This {{is not to be}} confused with electroless plating of the traces as the solution, commercially sold as Liquid Tin, does not contain the chemicals required <b>to</b> reduce <b>tin</b> (II) tetrafluoroborate <b>to</b> metallic <b>tin.</b> Rather, this chemical relies on the low pH created by the fluoroboric acid to increase the reduction potential of <b>tin</b> vs copper <b>to</b> the point <b>to</b> where <b>tin</b> preferentially plates on the copper traces.|$|R
50|$|Rennell Island has 8 informally run stores. In {{the limited}} times that {{supplies}} {{are available for}} sale they will be limited <b>to</b> <b>tinned</b> tuna, rice and a very small range of supplementary items. There are 3 similar stores at Bellona.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} (called {{kick the}} tin) played in Northern Ireland {{was to start}} the game {{by one of the}} hiders being selected <b>to</b> kick the <b>tin,</b> the further the tin was kicked gave more time for players to hide. A favoured strategy was to kick it over a garden hedge making it harder to retrieve. The seeker had <b>to</b> retrieve the <b>tin</b> and count loudly so that the hiders knew they were ready to start searching. When the seeker saw a hider they would race each other back <b>to</b> the <b>tin</b> and the seeker had <b>to</b> knock the <b>tin</b> three times before the hider could kick it away and releasing themselves and others. Hiders would try to sneak closer <b>to</b> the <b>tin</b> so that when the seeker was far from it they would try <b>to</b> kick the <b>tin</b> <b>to</b> release hiders previously caught. If a seeker was unlucky they could be seeking all afternoon. This game was very popular in the 1970s and all the kids in the street played from 5-18 year olds.|$|R
25|$|Tin is smelted from cassiterite, {{a mineral}} found in {{hydrothermal}} veins in granite, and the uplands of Dartmoor, in Devon, England, were a particularly productive area. The techniques {{used for the}} extraction of tin from Dartmoor followed a progression from streaming through open cast mining to underground mining. Today, there are extensive archaeological remains of these three phases of the industry, {{as well as of}} the several stages of processing that were necessary to convert the ore <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> metal.|$|E
25|$|Berlin {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Tin</b> Pan Alley {{after the}} war and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the Music Box Theater. He maintained an interest in the theater throughout his life, and even in his last years was known to call the Shubert Organization, his partner, to check on the receipts. In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets to the casting and musical arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Silver {{provides}} mechanical strength, but has worse ductility than lead. In {{absence of}} lead, it improves resistance to fatigue from thermal cycles. Using SnAg solders with HASL-SnPb-coated leads forms SnPb36Ag2 phase with melting point at 179°C, which {{moves to the}} board-solder interface, solidifies last, and separates from the board. Addition of silver <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> significantly lowers solubility of silver coatings in the tin phase. In eutectic tin-silver (3.5% Ag) alloy it tends to form platelets of Ag3Sn, which, if formed near a high-stress spot, may serve as initiating sites for cracks; silver content needs to be kept below 3% to inhibit such problems.|$|E
50|$|In addition, PbTe is {{also often}} alloyed with <b>tin</b> <b>to</b> make lead <b>tin</b> telluride, {{which is used}} as an {{infrared}} detector material.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Hulu Klang enjoyed {{unprecedented}} growth due <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> mining. Between 1849 and 1850, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, Raja Jumaat's cousin, {{was appointed}} by the sultan as Klang's administrator. As Lukut's economic importance was slowly declining, that of Hulu Klang was rising. This attracted many labourers to relocate there, especially Chinese immigrants who had worked in Lukut. One person responsible for persuading the Chinese to move from Lukut to Hulu Klang was Sutan Puasa from Ampang. He supplied the mining colonies in Hulu Klang with goods ranging from rice to opium. As Hulu Klang prospered, several settlements started to rise up by the late 1860s. Two of them were Kuala Lumpur and Klang. A Chinese kapitan named Yap Ah Loy was instrumental in developing Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|For {{a period}} {{following}} {{the second world}} war, pure nickel was electroplated as a lining to copper cookware. Nickel {{had the advantage of}} being harder and more thermally efficient than tin, with a higher melting point. Despite its hardness nickel's wear characteristics were similar to that of tin, as nickel would be plated only to a thickness of <20 microns, and often even less owing to nickel's tendency to plate somewhat irregularly, requiring milling to produce an even cooking surface, albeit sticky compared <b>to</b> <b>tin</b> and silver. Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings is eligible for retinning, or possibly replating with nickel, although this service is difficult if not impossible to find in the US and Europe in the early 21st century. Nickel linings began to fall out of favor in the 1980s owing to the isolation of nickel as an allergen.|$|E

500|$|The {{resulting}} show adapted {{plot and}} characters from Miller and Aubrey's Vaudeville comic sketches with music by Blake and Sissle. [...] Although {{the music of}} Shuffle Along was new to the public, only three compositions were actually written for the production: [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry", [...] "Bandana Days", and [...] "Love Will Find A Way". [...] The other songs used in the show were material that Blake and Sissle had tried unsuccessfully to sell <b>to</b> <b>Tin</b> Pan Alley. [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry" [...] and [...] "Love Will Find a Way" [...] in particular were politically risky for the era.|$|E
500|$|When they arrive, the Enterprise is {{attacked}} and disabled by a Romulan Warbird that had overly stressed their engines {{to catch up}} to them. The Romulans race ahead to try and communicate with Tin Man. [...] When Elbrun gleans from the Romulans telepathically that they intend to destroy Tin Man if they can't claim it, he sends it a telepathic warning <b>to</b> <b>Tin</b> Man. Tin Man suddenly comes to life and emits an energy wave that destroys the Warbird and further damages the Enterprise. Elbrun, now in communication with Tin Man, reveals that it calls itself Gomtuu. The creature is millennia-old and formerly had a crew, but they were lost in a radiation accident. Due to a combination of remorse, loneliness, and a lack of purpose, Gomtuu wishes to die in the supernova. Elbrun requests to be beamed aboard the creature, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is cautious of this action. When a second warbird arrives, Picard lets Elbrun transport to Gomtuu along with Data to help procure the ship. Elbrun is initially overwhelmed by Gomtuu, but eventually comes to identify himself with the ship.|$|E
