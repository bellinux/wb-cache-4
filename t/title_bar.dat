5|$|Charms {{have been}} removed; their {{functionality}} in Windows Store apps is accessed from an App commands menu on their <b>title</b> <b>bar.</b> In its place is Action Center, which displays notifications and settings toggles. It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area, or dragging {{from the right}} of the screen. Notifications can be synced between multiple devices. The Settings app (formerly PC Settings) was refreshed and now includes more options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|The Quick Access toolbar (by default) {{sits in the}} <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> {{and serves}} as a {{repository}} of most used functions, such as save, undo/redo and print. It is customizable, although this feature is limited, compared to toolbars in previous Office versions. Any command available in the entire Office application can be added to the Quick Access toolbar, including commands not available on the ribbon as well as macros. Keyboard shortcuts for any of the commands on the toolbar are also fully customizable, similar to previous Office versions.|$|E
25|$|Application updates {{automatically}} install {{from the}} Mac App Store. The iCloud library User interface (UI) was integrated throughout the operating systems, which includes new Open and Save dialog boxes across built-in applications, iWork and third-party applications via an Application programming interface (API). Applications that {{make use of}} this API support a new user interface to view and manage documents in the cloud that are specific to the application being used. Documents can be renamed from the <b>title</b> <b>bar.</b> iWork documents automatically synchronize with iCloud. The full screen ability is on every display.|$|E

25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window's <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).|$|E
500|$|Further {{interface}} behavior {{changes are}} made on the April 2014 [...] "Windows 8.1 Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the Start screen uses context menus instead of a toolbar {{across the bottom of}} the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> with minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop programs and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and power buttons are added to the Start screen. In non-touch environments, the default image viewer and media player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.|$|E
500|$|The Pirate Party Germany's {{parliamentary}} {{group in the}} Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin (the Berlin state parliament) has insisted on {{the inclusion of a}} break called [...] "pony time", in which an episode from the series is shown, during their meetings at their parliamentary office, which displeased many other members in the Berlin parliament. The internet activist group Anonymous used the character Rainbow Dash to deface the website of the Social Democratic Party of Austria in 2011 and 2012. A teenage white hat hacker used the name [...] "Pinkie Pie" [...] for anonymity and a fan drawing of the character wielding an axe as part of a successful entry in an early 2012 contest sponsored by Google Chrome to break the security of the web browser; the same user also was the first to break the security in a second contest held later in 2012, and found an important security flaw in the Linux kernel. A May 2013 update to Google Hangouts included an easter egg that would have Friendship Is Magic-inspired ponies run across the chat window. A similar update in August 2013 as part of YouTube's [...] "Geek Week" [...] added two easter eggs, one that would cause ponies to cross the screen on searching for [...] "bronies", and a second that, if searching on a number of different pony names like [...] "Twilight Sparkle", would change the site's <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> to a representative color of that pony.|$|E
5000|$|Sheets are [...] "posted" [...] out {{of window}} <b>title</b> <b>bars.</b> Sheets {{appear to be}} pieces of paper being thrust toward the user, or slide out like paper from a tray.|$|R
5000|$|According to Fulton, {{the word}} [...] "tab" [...] was picked because it {{conveniently}} started with 'T' and it put {{the emphasis on}} the squeezing feature window <b>title</b> <b>bars,</b> which made them look like folders with tabs.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea was}} {{developed}} at the Stanford Research Institute (led by Douglas Engelbart). Their earliest systems supported multiple windows, {{but there was no}} obvious way to indicate boundaries between them (such as window borders, <b>title</b> <b>bars,</b> etc.).|$|R
2500|$|Chrome {{allows users}} to make local desktop shortcuts that open web {{applications}} in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the <b>title</b> <b>bar,</b> {{so as not to}} [...] "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to Mozilla Prism and Fluid).|$|E
2500|$|When a {{topic is}} open, a <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> {{at the top}} of the Help window {{displays}} the topic title. [...] Below that is a row of menus (File, Edit, Bookmark, Options, and Help), which control various aspects of the file. [...] A row of buttons usually appears below the menus. [...] The Help author controls which buttons, if any, appear. Typical buttons include Contents, Index, Back, and Print, along with << and >> buttons to browse through the file. [...] Help authors can also create custom buttons to jump to specific topics or perform other actions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to criticism from customers, in Windows 8.1, a <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> is present but hidden unless users move the mouse cursor {{to the top}} of the screen. The [...] "hamburger" [...] menu button on their <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> gives access to the charms.|$|E
5000|$|WinRoll {{is an open}} source, free {{software}} utility for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 7 which allows the user to [...] "roll up" [...] windows into their <b>title</b> <b>bars,</b> {{in addition to other}} window management related features. It is compiled in assembly code.|$|R
50|$|Microwindows {{currently}} supports {{two different}} application programming interfaces (APIs). This set of routines handles client-server activity, window manager activities like drawing <b>title</b> <b>bars,</b> close boxes, etc., {{as well as}} handling the programmer's requests for graphics output. Both the APIs run {{on top of the}} core graphics engine routines and device drivers.|$|R
50|$|Intuition also {{anticipated}} {{the choices of}} the user by recognizing {{the position of the}} pointer floating over other elements of the screen (<b>title</b> <b>bars</b> of windows, their close and resizing gadgets, whole icons), and thus it was capable of granting nearly a zero-wait state experience {{to the use of the}} Workbench window manager.|$|R
5000|$|Technically, a reparenting {{window manager}} {{registers}} with the X server {{to be notified}} when a top-level window is mapped (attempts to become visible). When such an event is generated, the window manager creates a frame window, {{and in most cases}} also a <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> window. The frame window then becomes the parent of both the main window and the <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> window. Other forms of decoration, such as buttons, window title, etc., may also be created; these would normally be parented by the <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> window.|$|E
5000|$|Other window bars: menu bar, toolbar, address bar, <b>title</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some tiling window {{managers}} provide <b>title</b> <b>bars</b> {{which are}} purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These window managers {{do not allow}} windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar and may also serve {{the purpose of a}} status line from stacking window managers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} WinRoll {{is to allow}} users to have many windows on the screen, while keeping them {{organized}} and manageable. The main feature {{of the program is}} enabling the user to [...] "roll" [...] windows up into their <b>title</b> <b>bars.</b> It also allows users to minimize programs to the tray, and to adjust the opacity of windows.|$|R
50|$|The two bookends, which {{open and}} close the {{crossover}} were written by Neil Gaiman and Alisa Kwitney, with the middle five issues being the newly created or resurrected Annuals from the then-on-going Vertigo <b>titles</b> (<b>bar</b> the Arcana Annual, which re-launched a new Books of Magic series). These were written by those titles' then-authors: Dick Foreman, Jamie Delano, Nancy Collins, Rachel Pollack and John Ney Rieber, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Pretty much any {{element of}} the visual style can be edited. You can change the look of {{anything}} from the taskbar, <b>title</b> <b>bars,</b> start menu, progress bars, or control widgets. The sizes of elements can be changed as well. A few {{of the most popular}} examples would include thinner taskbars or compact start menus. StyleBuilder also allows editing of theme colors (such as the background color for dialog boxes and standard menus).|$|R

5000|$|WindowShade was {{a control}} panel {{extension}} for the classic Mac OS that allowed a user to double-click a window's <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> to [...] "roll up" [...] the window like a windowshade. When {{the window was}} [...] "rolled up", only the <b>title</b> <b>bar</b> of the window was visible; the window's content area disappeared, allowing easier manipulation of the windows on the screen.|$|E

50|$|A gadget in the {{top-right}} {{corner of}} the screen allows screens to be cycled. Screens can be overlaid by dragging each up or down by their <b>title</b> <b>bars.</b> As the OS stores all screens in memory simultaneously, redrawing is instantaneous. On early Amigas this functionality {{is provided by the}} custom chipset, but since AmigaOS4 a new hardware-assisted technique has been adopted and the screens are draggable in any direction. It is possible to drag and drop icons between screens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Title</b> <b>bars</b> {{of windows}} and dialog boxes now support two-color gradients. Windows menus and tooltips now support slide animation. Windows Explorer in Windows 98, like Windows 95, {{converts}} all uppercase filenames to sentence case for readability purposes; however, {{it also provides}} an option Allow all uppercase names to display them in their original case. Windows Explorer includes support for compressed CAB files. The Quick Res and Telephony Location Manager Windows 95 PowerToys are integrated into the core operating system.|$|R
