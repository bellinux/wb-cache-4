5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five}} years after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
25|$|This same trip proved tragic as both of Elisabeth's {{children}} {{became ill}} with diarrhea. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker, then died. It is generally assumed today that {{she died of}} typhus. Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy depression, which would haunt her {{for the rest of}} her life. She <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> living daughter, began neglecting her, and their relationship never recovered.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to the My Lai area {{at around}} 09:00 after refueling, the crew {{noticed that the}} people they had marked were now dead. [...] Out in a paddy field beside a dike 200 meters south of the hamlet, they marked the {{location}} of a wounded young Vietnamese woman. [...] Thompson and his crew watched from a low hover as Captain Ernest Medina (Charlie Company's Commander) came up to the woman, prodded her with his foot, stepped back, and then shot and killed her. (At his court martial, Medina claimed that he had <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> and then, startled by the sound of sudden movement behind him, spun back around and shot her, thinking she had been hiding a weapon under herself.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1890, Burnett's {{oldest son}} Lionel died from {{consumption}} in Paris, which greatly affected {{her life and}} her writing. Before his death, she sought a cure from physicians {{and took him to}} Germany to visit spas. After his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died. At this time she <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> traditional faith in the Church of England and embraced Spiritualism and Christian Science. [...] She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the Drury Lane Boys' Club, hosting an opening in February 1892. Also during this period she wrote a play with a starring role for Stephen Townsend in an attempt to begin his acting career. After a two-year absence from her Washington, D.C. home, her husband, and her younger son, Burnett returned there in March 1892, where she continued charity work and began writing again. [...] In 1893, Burnett published an autobiography, devoted to her eldest son, titled The One I Knew Best of All. Also in that year, she had a set of her books displayed at the Chicago World Fair.|$|E
