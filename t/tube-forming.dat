50|$|Peramphithoe femorata is a tubicolous (<b>tube-forming)</b> amphipod {{that feeds}} and makes its {{home on the}} giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. This brown alga is found in shallow water and can grow to a length of 45 m in a single season. It is {{attached}} to the substrate by a holdfast from which grow several long slender stems. These are clad in numerous small leaf-like blades growing from pneumatocysts (gas-filled bladders) and it is on these blades that the amphipod lives. The blades grow continuously from near their bases and the amphipod chooses a position some way along a blade, rolling the edges together to form a tube. It first deposits a mass of silk on the blade and grips this with its 5th, 6th and 7th pereopods. It then secures the edges of the blade to each other with a silken thread, produced from glands on the third and fourth pairs of pereopods, manipulating the thread with the first and second pairs. The weaving process continues rhythmically at the rate of about 24 silk attachments per minute, alternately on the left and right sides of the blade, and a tube is formed.|$|E
50|$|No Precambrian fossils {{are known}} from South Carolina. As such, the state's fossil record {{does not begin}} until the Paleozoic. During the Cambrian, at least the Batesburg area in the southwestern {{part of the state}} was {{submerged}} under seawater. This sea was home to trilobites. The rest of the Paleozoic is absent from the state's rock record, so the state has no sediments from the Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, or Permian in which fossils could have been preserved. The Triassic and Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic era are also missing from the state's rock record. During the Cretaceous, however, South Carolina was covered in sea water. Local marine life included oysters and <b>tube-forming</b> worms. Sometimes whole dinosaur carcasses would be washed out to sea. Fragments of bone and teeth from such remains have been preserved {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Late Cretaceous invertebrates included a bryozoan, coelenterats, gastropods, pelecypods, and scaphopods. The Late Cretaceous Peedee beds are known for their belemnites and other mollusks. During the Late Cretaceous, the flora of South Carolina included trees like eucalyptuses, laurel, magnolias, oak, sequoiah, walnut, and willows. Similar fossil trees have been found in Alabama, New Jersey, and Maryland. Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils have been found at several Donoho Creek Formation sites in northeastern South Carolina.|$|E

40|$|Expression of {{the large}} GTPase {{guanylate}} binding protein- 1 (GBP- 1) is induced by inflammatory cytokines (ICs) in endothelial cells (ECs), and the helical domain of the molecule mediates the repression of EC proliferation by ICs. Here we show that the expression of GBP- 1 and of the matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) are inversely related in vitro and in vivo, and that GBP- 1 selectively inhibits the expression of MMP- 1 in ECs, but not the expression of other proteases. The GTPase activity of GBP- 1 was necessary for this effect, which inhibited invasiveness and <b>tube-forming</b> capability of ECs in three-dimensional collagen-I matrices. A GTPase-deficient mutant (D 184 N-GBP- 1) operated as a transdominant inhibitor of wild-type GBP- 1 and rescued MMP- 1 expression {{in the presence of}} ICs. Expression of D 184 N-GBP- 1, as well as paracrine supplementation of MMP- 1, restored the <b>tube-forming</b> capability of ECs in the presence of wild-type GBP- 1. The latter finding indicated that the inhibition of capillary formation is specifically due to the repression of MMP- 1 expression by GBP- 1, and is not affected by the anti-proliferative activity of the helical domain of GBP- 1. These findings substantiate the role of GBP- 1 as a major regulator of the anti-angiogenic response of ECs to ICs...|$|E

40|$|Epithelial {{tubes are}} the {{functional}} units of many organs, and proper tube geometry {{is crucial for}} organ function. Here, we characterize serrano (sano), a novel cytoplasmic protein that is apically enriched in several <b>tube-forming</b> epithelia in Drosophila, including the tracheal system. Loss of sano results in elongated tracheae, whereas Sano overexpression causes shortened tracheae with reduced apical boundaries. Sano overexpression during larval and pupal stages causes planar cell polarity (PCP) defects in several adult tissues. In Sano-overexpressing pupal wing cells, core PCP proteins are mislocalized and prehairs are misoriented; sano loss or overexpression in the eye disrupts ommatidial polarity and rotation. Importantly, Sano binds the PCP regulator Dishevelled (Dsh), and loss or ectopic expression of many known PCP proteins in the trachea gives rise to similar defects observed with loss or gain of sano, revealing a previously unrecognized role for PCP pathway components in tube size control...|$|E
40|$|Sirtuin {{proteins}} {{have emerged}} as important modulators of several age-associated diseases. These in-clude cancer and diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Among the sir-tuin family members, SIRT 2 mRNA is strongly expressed. To investigate the pathophysiological sig-nificance of SIRT 2 as a primary regulator of angiogenesis, we focused on the biological role of SIRT 2 under hypoxic conditions, examining the gene expression pattern of sirtuin family members in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). SIRT 2 was expressed primarily in the cytoplasm, but it was dynamically trans-localized in the nuclear by hypoxia stimuli. Interestingly, both SIRT 2 and the pro-angiogenic factor, VEGF, were up- regulated by hypoxia. A Matrigel assay demonstrated that the HUVECs formed a tube-like structure under hypoxia. The SIRT 2 inhibitor, AK- 1, significantly de-creased the <b>tube-forming</b> activity of the HUVECs under either normoxia or hypoxia conditions. These findings suggest that SIRT 2 might be a key regulator of angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) are a {{subpopulation}} of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) {{that have}} the capacity for proliferation {{and the ability to}} promote angiogenesis. In this study, we identified Nectin- 2 as a surface protein of OECs through unbiased quantitative proteomics analysis. Using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, we confirmed that Nectin- 2 is highly expressed on OECs. Nectin- 2 (CD 112) expression was limited or lower on mononuclear cells (MNCs) and mature <b>tube-forming</b> endothelial cells (ECs). Blocking Nectin- 2 with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody significantly increased the trans-well migration and tube forming capacity of OECs. Similarly, Nectin- 2 knockdown resulted in enhanced tube formation, cell migration and proliferation with p-Erk activation. Moreover, Nectin- 2 deficiency resulted in compensatory increase of other Nectin family genes including Nectin- 3 and Necl- 4 which promote VEGFR signaling. These results indicate that Nectin- 2 is a surface marker and an important regulator of OECs, with significant implications for the isolation of OECs and blocking Nectin- 2 on OECs by an antibody for angiogenic applications...|$|E
40|$|Collagen and {{fibronectin}} matrices {{are known}} to stimulate migration of microvascular endothelial cells {{and the process of}} tubulogenesis, but the physical, chemical, and topographical cues for directed vessel formation have yet to be determined. In this study, growth, migration, elongation, and tube formation of human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (LECs) were investigated on electrospun poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactic-co-d-lactic acid) (PLDL) nanofiber-coated substrates, and correlated with fiber density and diameter. Directed migration of LECs was observed in the presence of aligned nanofibers, whereas random fiber alignment slowed down migration and growth of LECs. Cell guidance was significantly enhanced in the presence of more hydrophobic PLDL polymer nanofibers compared to PLGA (10 : 90). Subsequent experiments with <b>tube-forming</b> assays reveal the ability of resorbable hydrophobic nanofibers > 300 nm in diameter to promote cell guidance in collagen gels without direct cell–fiber contact, in contrast to the previously reported contact-guidance phenomena.

40|$|International audienceAlterations to {{colonization}} {{or early}} post-settlement stages may cause {{the reorganization of}} communities under future ocean acidification conditions. Yet, this hypothesis has been little tested by in situ pH manipulation. A Free Ocean Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FOCE) system was used to lower pH by a ~ 0. 3 unit offset within a partially enclosed portion (1. 7 m 3) of a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow (11 m depth) between 21 June and 3 November 2014. Epibiont colonization and early post settlement stages were assessed within the FOCE setup, {{as part of the}} larger community-level study, to better understand the outcome for a multispecies assemblage and the ecological processes that result in reported community shifts under altered carbonate chemistry. Two types of artificial collectors (tiles and scourers) were placed within three treatments: a pH-manipulated enclosure, an un-manipulated control enclosure, and an open plot in the ambient meadow. Tiles and scourers were collected after one to four months. Additionally, to see whether the outcome differed for communities in a later successional stage, previously settled scourer-collectors were also placed in the same three treatments. Enclosures acted to reduce settlement and migrant colonization. Scourers deployed for one to four months within the open-plot contained a community assemblage that could be distinguished from the assemblages within the enclosures. However, a comparison of enclosure assemblages on tiles showed evidence of a pH effect. There was lowered coverage of crustose coralline algae and fewer calcareous <b>tube-forming</b> polychaetes (Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus sp.) on tiles placed in the pH-manipulated enclosure compared to the un-manipulated enclosure. For assemblages in scourer collectors, shared and common taxa, in all treatments, were invertebrate polychaetes Psamathe fusca, Sphaerosyllis sp., Chrysopetalum sp., arthropods Harpacticoida, and Amphipoda, and the juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp. Similar organism composition and abundance, as well as taxonomic richness and evenness, were found in scourers from both enclosures. Pre-settled scourers contained greater numbers of individuals and more calcified members, but the assemblage, as well as the growth rate of a juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp., appeared unaffected by a two-month exposure to lowered pH and calcium carbonate saturation state. Results from this case study support the hypothesis that early stages of specific calcifiers (crustose coralline algae and calcareous <b>tube-forming</b> polychaetes) are sensitive to near future ocean acidification conditions yet suggest that negative effects on sessile micro-invertebrate assemblages will be minimal...|$|E

However, the functional impact of ADAMTS 9 on cancer development has not been explored. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesized antiangiogenic and tumor-suppressive functions of ADAMTS 9 in ESCC and NPC, in stringent tumorigenicity and Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. ADAMTS 9 activation suppressed tumor formation in nude mice. Conversely, knockdown of ADAMTS 9 resulted in clones reverting to the tumorigenic phenotype of parental cells. In vivo angiogenesis assays revealed a reduction in microvessel numbers in gel plugs injected with tumor-suppressive cell transfectants. Similarly, conditioned medium from cell transfectants dramatically reduced the <b>tube-forming</b> capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These activities were associated with a reduction in expression levels of the proangiogenic factors MMP 9 and VEGFA, which were consistently reduced in ADAMTS 9 transfectants derived from both cancers. Taken together, our results indicate that ADAMTS 9 contributes an important function in the tumor microenvironment that acts to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in both ESCC and NPC. © 2010 AACR. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} mechanism underlying {{steroid therapy}} for treating keloids remains unclear. Analytical results demonstrated that topical intra-lesional steroid injections suppress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in keloid tissue and induce its regression in vivo. This study investigated whether glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) downregulates VEGF expression and hinders keloid fibroblast (KF) proliferation in keloid regression. Primary KF cultures {{were treated with}} various concentrations of dexamethasone, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist (mifeprostone, RU- 486), VEGF-A antibody, VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGF-R 2) antagonist (SU- 5416), and VEGF protein. Analytical results demonstrated that dexamethasone retarded KFs proliferation. However, suppression of fibroblast proliferation by dexamethasone pre-treatment was reduced by adding exogenous VEGF protein. Dexamethasone suppressed endogenous VEGF mRNA induction, protein expressed by KFs, and angiogenesis activity detected by a <b>tube-forming</b> assay of human umbilical vein endothelial cells co-cultured fibroblasts. These effects were reversed by pre-treatment with RU- 486, and not by pre-treatment with SU- 5416. Thus, dexamethasone induces keloid regression via interaction with the GR and suppresses endogenous VEGF expression and fibroblast proliferation. However, exogenous VEGF promotes fibroblast proliferation through the GR-independent pathway. Modulation of VEGF production may comprise a valuable treatment modality for keloids...|$|E
40|$|The human {{epigenome}} is plastic. The goal of {{this study}} was to address if fibroblast cells can be epigenetically modified to promote neovessel formation. Here, we used highly abundant human adult dermal fibroblast cells (hADFCs) that were treated with the chromatin-modifying agents 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and subsequently subjected to differentiation by activating Wnt signaling. Our results show that these epigenetically modified hADFCs increasingly expressed β-catenin, pluripotency factor octamer-binding transcription factor- 4 (OCT 4, also known as POU 5 F 1), and endothelial cell (EC) marker called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2, also known as Fetal Liver Kinase- 1). In microscopic analysis, β-catenin localized to cell-cell contact points, while OCT 4 was found to be localized primarily to the nucleus of these cells. Furthermore, in a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment, OCT 4 bound to the VEGFR- 2 /FLK 1 promoter. Finally, these modified hADFCs also transduced Wnt signaling. Importantly, on a two-dimensional (2 D) gel substrate, a subset of the converted cells formed vascular network-like structures in the presence of VEGF. Chromatin-modifying agents converted hADFCs to OCT 4 + and VEGFR- 2 + capillary <b>tube-forming</b> cells in a 2 D matrix in VEGF-dependent manner...|$|E

In our screening program to search for antiangiogenic compounds from propolis, the ethanol extracts of Okinawan propolis (EEOP) showed significant antiangiogenic activities in a tube formation assay with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro at 3. 13 [*]μg/mL and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay in vivo at 25 [*]μg/egg. To elucidate the active compounds of EEOP and their mode of action, we isolated some prenylated flavonoids from EEOP and found that nymphaeol-A had the strongest antiangiogenic activity among them. Nymphaeol-A significantly reduced in vivo neovessel formation in the CAM assay at 25 [*]μg/egg. At the molecular level, nymphaeol-A markedly inactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 / 2 (MEK 1 / 2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2), whose molecular activations signal new vessel formation in HUVECs. In addition, nymphaeol-A dose- and time-dependently induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in <b>tube-forming</b> HUVECs. Taken together, nymphaeol-A was shown to inhibit angiogenesis at least in part via inactivation of MEK 1 / 2 –ERK 1 / 2 signaling and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Okinawan propolis and its major component, nymphaeol-A, may be useful agents for preventing tumor-induced angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies of chromosome 14 transfer into tumorigenic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell line, SLMT, suggested the existence of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 14. Gene expression profiling of microcell hybrids and the tumor segregants identified an interesting gene, LTBP- 2 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2), which has been analyzed here for its role in ESCC. LTBP- 2 maps to 14 q 24 and encodes a secreted protein, which is {{a component of the}} extracellular matrix microfibrils. LTBP- 2 expression was downregulated in ESCC cell lines and tumor tissues. Promoter hypermethylation was found to be involved in LTBP- 2 inactivation. Functional studies indicated its tumor-suppressive roles in ESCC. In the in vitro colony formation and Matrigel three-dimensional culture assays, LTBP- 2 decreased the colony-forming abilities of ESCC cell lines. LTBP- 2 expression was associated with reduction of cell migrating and invasive abilities. LTBP- 2 could also reduce the <b>tube-forming</b> ability of endothelial cells. Moreover, LTBP- 2 induced tumor suppression in in vivo nude mouse assays. Tissue microarray immunohistochemical staining analysis indicated that LTBP- 2 expression is reduced in tumor tissues when compared to normal tissues, and LTBP- 2 expression correlated significantly with the survival of ESCC patients.

40|$|The {{platelet}} receptor CLEC- 2 is {{the only}} known endogenous ligand for the transmembrane receptor podoplanin, which is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) {{as well as a}} number of other cell types. Both CLEC- 2 and podoplanin are required for normal lymphangiogenesis as mouse embryos lacking either protein develop a phenotype in which blood is detected in the lymphatic vessels. This thesis examines the role of the podoplanin-CLEC- 2 interaction in the migratory and <b>tube-forming</b> capabilities of LEC. Addition of platelets or antibody-mediated podoplanin crosslinking both inhibited migration of LEC in transfilter migration assays in the presence, but not absence, of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C. Similarly, platelets and podoplanin crosslinking reduced stability of LEC networks formed in co-cultures with fibroblasts. We also found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of podoplanin negated the pro-migratory effects of VEGF-C and VEGF-A. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that podoplanin signalling may involve RhoA and Rho-kinase, and that the effect of podoplanin might be linked to its phosphorylation by protein kinase A downstream of VEGF receptor signalling. These data suggest that the interaction of podoplanin and CLEC- 2 prevents connection between blood and lymphatic vessels through reductions in LEC migration and stability of cell-cell interactions...|$|E

Using conventional epi-illuminescence microscopy, the convoluted architecture demonstrating branch points within capillaries, between capillaries and larger vessels, were clearly observed in uterine and subcutaneous gluteal fat samples. In adult endometrial tissue where angiogenesis occurs on a monthly basis, complex anastamosis of vessels and tenuous structures were clearly seen.

Robustness testing of the <b>tube-forming</b> device prompted two base unit designs and a protocol in order to achieve coefficient of variation (CV) values under 5 % of tube length for infusion rates up to 100 ml/min and alginate concentrations ranging from 0. 50 – 1. 00 %. Tubes with wall thicknesses between 143. 4 – 277. 3 ìm can be reliably reproduced for tubes of any length. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) at ± 10 ìm accuracy was adapted to directly monitor alginate wall thickness and rate of shrinkage in real-time through air. This was determined to be ~ 12 minutes for tube walls to stabilise and a high speed camera showed no spherical regulator spin as the tube is formed, indicating that monitoring at one point is sufficient to determine the overall quality of the tube wall consistency. Cell sample homogeneity monitored by particle sizer revealed two distinct single-celled populations, and smaller peak of cytoplasmic residue. Capillary cytometer was determined the best way to enumerate cell quantity reliably and consistently. Holding time above 3 hours can significantly cause aggregation, but this can be controlled using filtration of known pore size. Kenics static mixers were used to integrate cells into alginate prior to tube formation and showed equally good control to wall thickness as pure alginate tubes at ~CV 7 %. Cell viability of above 90 % after processing through the static mixer and the <b>tube-forming</b> mark 2 device was achievable using Pronova SLG 100 pre-liquified alginate.

The extent of in vitro angiogenesis {{was assessed by}} the total length of tube structures formed by BCEs per area measured quantitatively with an image analyzer. The tube formation in CM obtained from the cultivation of SMCs at 1 % O 2 for 24 hours was enhanced by about 1. 5 times and 3. 4 times as compared with those at 5 % O 2 and 20 % O 2, respectively. This <b>tube-forming</b> activity was abrogated by the pretreatment of CM with anti-transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta 1 IgG, but not by anti-basic fibroblast growth factor IgG. The SMC-CM obtained from hypoxic cultivation (1 % O 2 for 24 hours) inhibited [3 H] thymidine incorporation by BCEs, SMCs, and fibroblasts more than about 20 % of control. Anti-TGF-beta 1 IgG thus significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of hypoxic SMC-CM on DNA synthesis of these cells. These results suggest that SMCs in a hypoxic state release active in vitro angiogenic factors into CM, and active TGF-beta 1 {{is closely related to}} the in vitro angiogenic enhancement of media conditioned by SMCs cultured in a hypoxic state...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years, {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest regarding the formation of lava tubes in basalt flows. This interest has been created, in part, by the NASA Space Program 2 ̆ 7 s geological research and, in part, by {{an awareness of the}} paucity of research done in this field. Some of the observations have been recorded on actively forming tubes (Greeley, 1971; Sterns, 1966; MacDonald, 1970) while others have been recorded on tubes already formed (Harter 2 ̆ 6 Harter, 1970; Ollier 2 ̆ 6 Brown, 1965).

The final product of this project is to be a 1 : 1, 000, 000 -scale geologic map. The scientific questions upon which this mapping project is based include understanding the volcanic development and modification by structural, aeolian, and possibly glacial processes. The project s scientific objectives are based upon preliminary mapping by Bleacher et al. [1] along a approx. 80 -km-wide north-south swath of the volcano corresponding to High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) image h 0037. The preliminary project, which covered approx. 20 % of the volcano s surface, resulted in several significant findings, including: 1) channel-fed lava flow surfaces are areally more abundant than tube-fed surfaces by a ratio of 5 : 1, 2) channel-fed flows consistently embay tube-fed flows, 3) lava fans appear to be linked to tube-fed flows, 4) no volcanic vents were identified within the map region, and 5) a Hummocky unit surrounds the summit and is likely a combination of non-channelized flows, dust, ash, and/or frozen volatiles. These results led to the suggestion that the volcano had experienced a transition from long-lived <b>tube-forming</b> eruptions to more sporadic and shorter-lived, channel-forming eruptions, as seen at Hawaiian volcanoes between the tholeiitic shield building phase (Kilauea to Mauna Loa) and alkalic capping phase (Hualalai and Mauna Kea) ...|$|E
40|$|PMA 1 expression, plasma {{membrane}} H(+) -ATPase enzyme kinetics, {{and the distribution}} of the ATPase have been studied in carbon-starved Candida albicans induced with glucose for yeast growth at pH 4. 5 and for germ tube formation at pH 6. 7. PMA 1 expression parallels expression of the constitutive ADE 2 gene, increasing up to sixfold during yeast growth and twofold during germ tube formation. Starved cells contain about half the concentration of {{plasma membrane}} ATPase of growing cells. The amount of plasma membrane ATPase is normalized prior to either budding or germ tube emergence by the insertion of additional ATPase molecules, while ATPase antigen appears uniformly distributed over the entire plasma membrane surface during both growth phases. Glucose addition rapidly activates the ATPase twofold regardless of the pH of induction. The turnover of substrate molecules per second by the enzyme in membranes from budding cells quickly declines, but the enzyme from germ <b>tube-forming</b> cells maintains its turnover of substrate molecules per second and a higher affinity for Mg-ATP. The plasma membrane ATPase of C. albicans is therefore regulated at several levels; by glucose metabolism/starvation-related factors acting on gene expression, by signals generated through glucose metabolism/starvation which are thought to covalently modify the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme, and possibly by additional signals which may be specific to germ tube formation. The extended period of intracellular alkalinization associated with germ tube formation may result from regulation of proton-pumping ATPase activity coupled with higher ratios of cell surface to effective cytosolic volume...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Roxarsone (3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxy benzene arsonic acid) is an arsenic {{compound}} {{widely used}} in the poultry industry as a feed additive to prevent coccidiosis, stimulate growth, and to improve tissue pigmentation. Little {{is known about the}} potential human health effects from roxarsone released into the environment from chicken waste or from residual compound in chicken products. OBJECTIVE: The growth potentiation and enhanced tissue pigmentation suggest that low levels of roxarsone exposure may have an angiogenic potential similar to that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII). The goal of this investigation was to test the hypothesis described above using cultured human aortic and lung microvascular endothelial cells in high-content imaging <b>tube-forming</b> assays and begin developing a molecular level understanding of the process. METHODS: We used a three-dimensional Matrigel assay for probing angiogenesis in cultured human endothelial cells, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array to probe the gene changes as a function of roxarsone or AsIII treatment. In addition, we used Western blot analysis for changes in protein concentration and activation. RESULTS: Roxarsone was found to exhibit a higher angiogenic index than AsIII at lower concentrations. Increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was observed for roxarsone but not for AsIII-induced angiogenesis. However, AsIII caused more rapid and pronounced phosphorylation of eNOS. Quantitative PCR array on select genes revealed that the two compounds have different and often opposite effects on angiogenic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that roxarsone and AsIII promote angiogenic phenotype in human endothelial cells through distinctly different signaling mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of radiotherapy, {{collateral}} effects of ablative doses of ionizing radiation (AIR) on stromal components of tumors remains understudied. In this work, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from freshly resected human lung tumors were exposed to AIR (1 x 18 Gy) and analyzed for their release of paracrine factors. Inflammatory mediators and regulators of angiogenesis and tumor growth were analyzed by multiplex protein assays in conditioned medium (CM) from irradiated and non-irradiated CAFs. Additionally, the profile of secreted proteins was examined by proteomics. In functional assays, effects of CAF-CM on proliferative and migratory capacity of lung tumor cells (H- 520 /H- 522) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and their <b>tube-forming</b> capacity were assessed. Our data show that exposure of CAFs to AIR results in 1) downregulated release of angiogenic molecules such as stromal cell-derived factor- 1, angiopoietin, and thrombospondin- 2 (TSP- 2); 2) upregulated release of {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} from most donors; and 3) unaffected expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 8, IL- 1 β, and tumor necrosis factor-α. CM from irradiated and control CAFs did not affect differently the proliferative or migratory capacity of tumor cells (H- 520 /H- 522), whereas migratory capacity of HUVECs was partially reduced in the presence of irradiated CAF-CM. Overall, we conclude that AIR mediates a transformation on the secretory profile of CAFs that could influence the behavior of other cells in the tumor tissue and hence guide therapeutic outcomes. Downstream consequences of the changes observed in this study merits further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} common {{etiological}} agent of vaginal candidiasis. Elevated host estrogen levels and the incidence of vaginal candidiasis are positively associated. Elevated estrogen levels may affect host and/or fungal cells. This study investigates the effect of 17 -β-estradiol, 17 -α-estradiol, ethynyl estradiol, and estriol on several C. albicans strains at concentrations ranging from 10 − 5 to 10 − 10 M. The addition of 17 -β-estradiol or ethynyl estradiol to C. albicans cells caused {{an increase in the number}} of cells forming germ tubes and an increase in germ tube length in a dose- and strain-dependent manner. The addition of 17 -α-estradiol or estriol did not have a significant effect on germ tube formation by the cultured cells. Exposure to exogenous estrogens did not significantly change the biomass of any C. albicans culture tested. The transcriptional profile of estrogen-treated C. albicans cells showed increased expression of CDR 1 and CDR 2 across several strain-estrogen concentration-time point combinations, suggesting that these genes are the most responsive to estrogen exposure. Analysis of strain DSY 654, which lacks the CDR 1 and CDR 2 coding sequences, showed a significantly decreased number of germ <b>tube-forming</b> cells in the presence of 17 -β-estradiol. PDR 16 was the most highly up-regulated gene in strain DSY 654 under these growth conditions. The cell biology and gene expression data from this study led to a model that proposes how components of the phospholipid and sterol metabolic pathways may interact to affect C. albicans germ tube formation and length...|$|E
40|$|Fibrin or a fibrinous exudate can {{facilitate}} angiogenesis in many pathological conditions. In vitro, the outgrowth of capillary-like structures in fibrin can be mimicked by exposing human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) to an angiogenic growth factor and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and plasmin activities {{are required for}} this angiogenic process. This study focuses on the role and localization of the u-PA receptor (u-PAR) in newly formed microvascular structures. The u-PAR-blocking monoclonal antibody (MAb) H- 2 completely inhibited the formation of capillary-like tubular structures induced by exposure of hMVECs to {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} and TNF-alpha. This was accompanied by a several-fold increase in u-PA accumulation in the conditioned medium. The effect of MAb H- 2 was not caused by blocking cellular activation by u-PA/u-PAR interaction, as the aminoterminal fragment (ATF) of u-PA, which also activates u-PAR, prevented tube formation. In addition, the inhibition by MAb H- 2 was not due to an effect of the antibody on u-PAR-vitronectin binding. These data show that inhibition of tube formation can be caused not only by inhibition of u-PA or plasmin activities but also by unavailability of the u-PAR for cell-bound proteolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in in vitro angiogenesis u-PAR and u-PA were localized on the invading, <b>tube-forming</b> hMVECs and not on the endothelial cells that are located on top of the fibrin matrix. u-PAR and u-PA were also prominently expressed on endothelial cells of neovessels present in an atherosclerotic plaque. These data may give more insight into the role of u-PAR in repair-associated angiogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Lava flow mapping was {{conducted}} on a north-south transect of Olympus Mons using the European Space Agency's Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) image H 0037. The HRSC image was coregistered to Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, Thermal Emission Imaging System, and Mars Orbiter Camera data, enabling lava flow structures to be differentiated and mapped consistently across the shield. Because different structures develop {{as a result of}} different effusive conditions, their abundance and distribution provide insight into the eruptive history of a shield volcano. Results show that lava channels are the dominant flow structure, whereas tabular sheets are most common beyond the basal scarp. A hummocky unit dominates the summit area and likely represents a combination of (1) volcanic lava flows, (2) pyroclastic deposits, (3) a dust mantle, and (4) frozen volatiles, all of which have been suggested to exist on Olympus Mons in the past. Lava fans are typically associated with lava tubes, indicating that they represent tube outbreaks as was previously suggested as one possible formation mechanism. No vents were identified, suggesting that major rift zones have not developed on the north or south flank. Younger channel-fed flows typically embay older tube-related flows, which they outnumber by a ratio of 5 : 1. Therefore Olympus Mons likely experienced a change in eruptive style from longer-lived, stable, <b>tube-forming</b> eruptions to shorter-lived, less stable, channel-forming eruptions in the late Amazonian. A similar trend exists for the Hawaiian volcanoes in which a decrease in the magma production rate drives a change to dominantly channel forming eruptions associated with increased shield age...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} consume wood as food (xylotrophy) is unusual among animals. In {{terrestrial}} environments, termites and other xylotrophic insects are the principle wood consumers while in marine environments wood-boring bivalves fulfill this role. However, the evolutionary origin of wood feeding in bivalves has remained largely unexplored. Here we provide data indicating that xylotrophy has arisen just once in Bivalvia {{in a single}} wood-feeding bivalve lineage that subsequently diversified into distinct shallow- and deep-water branches, {{both of which have}} been broadly successful in colonizing the world's oceans. These data also suggest that the appearance of this remarkable life habit was approximately coincident with the acquisition of bacterial endosymbionts. Here we generate a robust phylogeny for xylotrophic bivalves and related species based on sequences of small and large subunit nuclear rRNA genes. We then trace the distribution among the modern taxa of morphological characters and character states associated with xylotrophy and xylotrepesis (wood-boring) and use a parsimony-based method to infer their ancestral states. Based on these ancestral state reconstructions we propose a set of plausible hypotheses describing the evolution of symbiotic xylotrophy in Bivalvia. Within this context, we reinterpret {{one of the most remarkable}} progressions in bivalve evolution, the transformation of the "typical" myoid body plan to create a unique lineage of worm-like, <b>tube-forming,</b> wood-feeding clams. The well-supported phylogeny presented here is inconsistent with most taxonomic treatments for xylotrophic bivalves, indicating that the bivalve family Pholadidae and the subfamilies Teredininae and Bankiinae of the family Teredinidae are non-monophyletic, and that the principle traits used for their taxonomic diagnosis are phylogenetically misleading...|$|E
40|$|Sympathetic nerves {{have long}} been {{suspected}} of trophic activity, but {{the nature of their}} angiogenic factor has not been determined. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a sympathetic cotransmitter, is the most abundant peptide in the heart and the brain. It is released during nerve activation and ischemia and causes vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Here we report the first evidence that NPY is angiogenic. At low physiological concentrations, in vitro, it promotes vessel sprouting and adhesion, migration, proliferation, and capillary tube formation by human endothelial cells. In vivo, in a murine angiogenic assay, NPY is angiogenic and is as potent as a basic fibroblast growth factor. The NPY action is specific and is mediated by Y 1 and Y 2 receptors. The expression of both receptors is upregulated during cell growth; however, Y 2 appears to be the main NPY angiogenic receptor. Its upregulation parallels the NPY-induced capillary tube formation on reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel); the Y 2 agonist mimics the <b>tube-forming</b> activity of NPY, whereas the Y 2 antagonist blocks it. Endothelium contains not only NPY receptors but also peptide itself, its mRNA, and the "NPY-converting enzyme" dipeptidyl peptidase IV (both protein and mRNA), which terminates the Y 1 activity of NPY and cleaves the Tyr 1 -Pro 2 from NPY to form an angiogenic Y 2 agonist, NPY 3 - 36. Endothelium is thus not only the site of action of NPY but also the origin of the autocrine NPY system, which, together with the sympathetic nerves, may be important in angiogenesis during tissue development and repair...|$|E
