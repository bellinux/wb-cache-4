5|$|Beyond {{the core}} territory, {{there is a}} larger feeding range which is {{variable}} in size, but typically ten or more times {{the area of the}} breeding territory. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> has a larger feeding range than the male. After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is continuously evaluating {{the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> can {{discriminate}} colours {{when choosing}} host plants for oviposition.|$|R

5|$|In an {{expedition}} to Shinganshina, the Scouts are attacked by a Female Titan who attempts to capture Eren. Although the Scouts are able to briefly capture the Female Titan, she breaks free and devastates Levi's squad, forcing the expedition to retreat. Armin determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Female</b> Titan is Annie, one of the cadets who taught Eren to fight, and devises a plan to capture her at Stohess. During this operation, collateral damage reveals that Titans reside in and make up the walls surrounding the human settlements.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{find out}} that the Lone Gunmen have become trapped inside First Person Shooter, with {{somebody}} trying to kill them. Mulder enters the game, where he sees Maitreya and follows her. In the real world, Phoebe tearfully admits to Scully <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> warrior was created by her as a sort of personal estrogenic outlet in a testosterone-fuelled environment. Maitreya was to be contained within Phoebe's personal separate project, but the character found her way into the First Person Shooter program.|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, female genital {{diseases}} {{can be more}} strictly {{classified by}} location of the disease, which, in turn, can be broadly divided between diseases <b>that</b> affect <b>the</b> <b>female</b> internal genitalia and those <b>that</b> affect <b>the</b> <b>female</b> external genitalia.|$|R
50|$|Males have hemipenal bulges at {{the base}} of the tail. Males also have a pair of pre-anal pores/scales just above <b>the</b> cloacal opening <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> lack.|$|R
50|$|The drone has {{a yellow}} {{head with a}} few black hairs. The {{coloration}} of the thorax and abdomen is similar to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> with <b>the</b> exception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last abdominal segments are yellow on the sides. The fur of the drone is longer than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Male mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{also needs}} {{to ensure that the}} mate does not leave the mateship as this would lose access to future chances that the male may have to reproduce. Moreover, the male would also lose any maternal efforts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> would have invested in to any potential offspring. Additionally, access to any social benefits or helping networks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> brought to the relationship could be lost. Finally, the female could also use information, such as strengths or weakness, about the male to exploit him in the future.|$|E
25|$|These female {{students}} filed lawsuits demanding {{that they be}} allowed to take their exams after checking their identity. Some girls proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> wearing niqāb could all go in one room, unveil, and be monitored by women.|$|R
25|$|The {{males have}} {{feathery}} antennae versus the thin antennae of females. Size differences are also noted, with the forewing {{of the male}} moth being 20–24mm long, and <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> 31–35mm. Obviously, from this it is noticeable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are bigger than the males. Another important difference between <b>the</b> sexes is <b>that</b> <b>females</b> possess fully formed wings, but do not fly. Female flight is common in Eurasia and Asia, but these moths may be of a different species. The other species is called the Asian gypsy moth.|$|R
50|$|A female genital {{disease is}} a {{condition}} <b>that</b> affects <b>the</b> <b>female</b> reproductive system.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{coercion}} {{is forcing}} mate choice against a partner’s will or preference. Sexual coercion functions {{to increase the}} chance of a female mating with a male, and decrease the chance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> will mate with another male. There are several strategies by which sexual coercion can be achieved. These are harassment, intimidation, and forced copulation (rape).|$|E
25|$|In many species, {{seminal fluid}} {{can be used}} as a sort of mating plug. Males of these species {{transfer}} their sperm at the beginning of copulation and use the rest of copulation to transfer substances that help build up the mating plugs. These plugs are effective in ensuring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> does not mate with any other males and that the male’s paternity is secured.|$|E
25|$|In many animals, {{males are}} {{much smaller than}} females. In some species of anglerfish, such as Ceratias holboelli, the males are so small they have become sexual parasites, wholly {{dependent}} on females of their own species for survival, and unable to fend for themselves. The female nourishes the male and protects him from predators, while the male gives nothing back except the sperm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> needs to produce the next generation.|$|E
50|$|In the verses, it is {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> partner has left her ("I guess your Prince Charming wasn't, after all").

25|$|A cameo {{portrait}} of a lady with the silhouettes of two infants, has been tentatively identified as Livilla. Although {{it is possible that}} the seated woman on right on the Great Cameo of France represents Livilla, it seems more likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> figure seated on the left and holding a roll represents Livilla, depicted there as the widowed wife of Drusus the Younger, seen just above her as one of the three heavenly imperial male figures.|$|E
25|$|Riggs {{had been}} one of the world's top tennis players in the 1940s; he once held the top ranking and had won six major titles during his career. After he retired from {{professional}} tennis in 1951, Riggs remained a master promoter of himself and of tennis. In 1973, he opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> game was inferior and that even at his current age of 55 he could still beat any of the top female players.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{found in}} females {{measured}} up to 5.1mm {{in diameter and}} had large yolk supplies. These large supplies are common among species that live entirely off yolk during their development. Most female frogs had around 40 ripe eggs, almost double that {{of the number of}} juveniles ever found in the stomach (21–26). This means one of two things, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> fails to swallow all the eggs or the first few eggs to be swallowed are digested.|$|E
40|$|In Japan, {{many kinds}} of aphids over winter in the egg stage on their host plants. It is a well known fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oviparous <b>females</b> in {{bisexual}} generation deposite the eggs around the winter buds of the twigs of the host plant under outdoor conditions. Hitherto, this fact has been recorded by several workers as shown in Table 1. In this paper the author reports the results of some observations on the oviposition habit of <b>the</b> oviparous <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> author has observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oviparous <b>females</b> prefer cotton fibre to other things in their oviposition as shown in Table 2. It seems very possible to <b>the</b> author <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oviparous <b>females</b> are not sensitive to the host plant in their oviposition. It {{is considered to be}} a certain fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oviparous <b>females</b> lay all of the eggs in a few day after mating as shown in Table 3...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{concerning}} oviposition preference {{were carried}} out on Ceratitis capitata to determine whether females are able to preferentially oviposit on natural hosts in which the larvae develop better. <b>The</b> results indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> do not preferentially oviposit on hosts of better nutritive value for the larvae...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Taiping rebels {{but like}} many Chinese folk sects, Boxer {{ideology}} forbade contact with women.

25|$|P. alpina only begins {{flowering}} {{after several}} years of growth. Six to eight (occasionally up to 13) flowers are borne singly on unbranched inflorescences up to 12cm (5in) tall. The zygomorphic flowers are 10–16mm (⅜-⅝in) long with a short yellow-green spur and are composed of a two-lobed upper lip and three-lobed lower lip. They are white with one or sometimes three yellow markings on the lower lip. These can be variable in size and shape. The flowers are protogynous, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> stigmas mature before the male anthers, and are pollinated by flies.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} tactics {{employed by}} males {{tend to be}} hiding the female from intrasexual threats; this could be not bringing the mate to social events in which other competing males may be present. Another is to request <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> wear items that indicate possession, {{this could be a}} wedding ring or the male's jacket for example. Males may also demonstrate the quality of resources they have to offer (e.g. buying the mate gifts, or paying for a meal). Men {{are also more likely to}} employ threatening and violent behaviour towards intrasexual rivals.|$|E
25|$|In the monogamous species, the {{mantis shrimp}} {{remain with the}} same partner for up to 20years. They share the same burrow and {{may be able to}} {{coordinate}} their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In Pullosquilla and some species in Nannosquilla, the female will lay two clutches of eggs: one that the male tends and one <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as plankton.|$|E
