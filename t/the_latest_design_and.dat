Nothing, however, had {{prepared}} him for the transformation which he now saw. She was faultlessly dressed in a gown of <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> a picture hat which even he recognized as being something quite apart from the usual efforts of even the Bond Street shopkeepers. In every detail she seemed to express the wholly self-satisfied, half-insolent perfection of the woman who knows that she may and does command the best of everything. And with this change in her dress seemed to have come a similar change in her deportment. Her aloofness was still evident enough, but she carried herself with confidence, and with a sort of languid, graceful ease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractClimate {{control and}} energy saving {{are the key}} words for <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> {{enhancements}} on textile structures. In the past, the improvements on energy savings in textile structures had already been taken into consideration. The first important examples {{can be found at}} the private clinic of Masserberg and at the swimming pool of Torres Novas. In those cases, traditional isolating materials and textile fabrics were utilised in combination, but total opacity to light was the resulting effect. Today the same issues were studied in order to ensure that the natural light could pass through, by combining multilayer fabrics meant to obtain the best energy savings for heating and cooling. The swimming pools and wellness centre of Splash & SPA in Switzerland and the walkway roof of the Centre Commercial Perpignan in France, were constructed by utilising the said materials. The combination of fabric and structural design is the latest example of the Miami Brickell Centre covering: fitted with massive fabric-covered louvers, Swire's “Climate Ribbon TM”— thus named because it resembles a crumpled strip of ribbon — is designed to allow natural light while shading shoppers and channelling prevailing breezes from Biscayne Bay to cool them. The highly engineered canopy is the product of a collaboration between a Paris design firm Hugh Dutton & Associates and the universities of Carnegie-Mellon in Pittsburgh and Cardiff in the U. K [...] It is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and possibly the biggest passive shading and ventilation device — i. e., not dependent on air conditioning. The primary objective is to provide optimization of environmental quality for the shopping centre. The structure is designed to obtain three key benefits:-ventilation (avoid the use of air conditioning) -shelter from inclement weather-shading from the su...|$|E

It first started as a {{sporting}} store chain for Ecuador, but in 1994, the Reebok contract with Ecuador's national football team expired.

Their first national squad jersey design had a band of thick blue and red strips on the right shoulder reflecting the flag of Ecuador. After being close to qualify for their very first FIFA world cup in 1998, the F.E.F (Federacion Ecuatoriana de Futbol) decided to stick with the brand, releasing a design reflecting more of an Andean style. In 2002 the Ecuadorian team qualified for its very first World Cup in Korea/Japan, FIFA's first jointly hosted World Cup.

The conditions at which a maximum yield of oil could be obtained (80 °C, 600 atm, 70 min) were determined by performing runs according to a statistical design and processing the data by computer assisted surface response analysis. The temperature and pressure dependencies of the extraction were also studied in order to calculate activation parameters (Ea ~ 0 kJ/mol, AV' = - 130 mL/mol) and hence assisted in confirming the mechanistic steps (chemical dissolution, diffusion controlled transport) of the extraction process. Finally the effect of pre-drying of seed and using different cultivars of seed on the extraction was studied. Master...|$|E

A software product line is defined as a family of products designed to take advantage of their common aspects and predicted variability. The product line approach is promising for the creation of customizable software, because variations resulting from different customer requirements are subject to careful planning and systematic reuse.
