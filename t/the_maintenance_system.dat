40|$|The Air Force {{sustainment}} system, {{which includes}} maintenance and logistics, is facing difficult challenges. As <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> is being downsized, operations tempo is increasing and private companies are entering into competition for maintenance workload. The Air Force is {{under intense pressure}} to improve maintenance performance. Attempts to change <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> in a piecemeal fashion have often led to unintended consequences and global sub-optimization. High-level simulation models of <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> that could illustrate critical tradeoffs could provide a valuable tool for learning, and help improve system performance in the future. This thesis uses a simple high-level simulation model to model the sustainment of a unit of C- 5 aircraft. It examines high-level tradeoffs in performance and cost due {{to the number of}} aircraft, the number of spare parts, and cannibalization practices. The effects of depot repair time and the failure probability of aircraft parts are also considered. In a system like that of the Air Force sustainment system that aims to improve maintenance and logistics performance and reduce cost, yet must deal with large demand variability and must be prepared for wartime surge, cannibalization, a large number of aircraft, and a large inventory of spare parts may be necessary and may even be cost-effective. by Luis C.

40|$|The {{established}} {{approach to}} safety management {{has failed to}} handle socio-technical systems that have become more complex. The main argument is this approach is based on assumptions that systems are protected against accidents by barriers (well-trained people, redundant mechanisms and safety devices, and procedures and safe systems of work). Complex systems, such as maintenance, are actually labour intensive; maintenance staff often works under pressure to finish tasks as rapidly as possible. They continuously adapt and make adjustments using available resources, time, knowledge, and competence to achieve success. Thus, they are accidents prone. Human factors inherent to maintenance accidents are most times difficult to identify. Research in this area in {{the oil and gas}} industry in maintenance management is limited in comparison to the aviation and nuclear sectors. Therefore, it has been suggested to overcome this lack by exploring <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> and identifying appropriate methods and tools that lead a system to safety excellence. Resilience engineering (RE) approach has been found the suitable solution. Moreover, four system abilities (cornerstones of RE: ability to respond, to monitor, to anticipate, and to learn) have been identified to characterise the resilience of a system; if these abilities are known and increased, it will make the system As High Resilient As Possible (AHRAP). However, there is a need to bridge between RE theory and practice. Particularly, a tool that measures these abilities lacks in {{the oil and gas industry}}, specifically within <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system.</b> In doing so, a framework based on a Gap Analysis (GA) was outlined. A tool, <b>the</b> <b>MAintenance</b> <b>System</b> Resilience Assessment Tool- MASRAT, was developed to assess current system resilience and identify strategies for improvement to achieve safety excellence. <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> of SONATRACH was explored by the analysis of the system documentation and processes, interviews with maintenance staff, questionnaires, field observations, storytelling, and functional analysis. MASRAT has been validated by means of congruency and principal components analysis, PCA (content validity), and Cronbach’s alpha (reliability). An expert panel testing was carried out to test its usability. The exploration of the system came up with a snapshot of daily activities as well as a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system.</b> The study identified the most significant human factors (resources, time pressure, and supervision/coordination) and their probable impact on plant safety. The elements of the system were found tightly coupled, hence the system complex. Stories describing the continuous adaptations of people to achieve assigned objectives were collected. On the other hand, MASRAT was validated. All items were rated above 0. 75 in congruency test. The results of PCA for the three selected factors confirmed the items may be clustered after extraction into four components which interpretation represents the four cornerstones of RE. The analysis showed MASRAT is reproducible. Cronbach’s alpha results were found higher than what is required (0. 7). MASRAT was found usable by maintenance expert panel. It was used to measure the maintenance department resilience. Strategies that may lead the system from current maturity level to excellence were identified. Eventually, recommendations were made to management to be implemented both at corporate and department levels. For the first time, the maintenance department resilience of petroleum assets was measured to fill in the gap between RE theory and practice. Besides, this can be of benefit to the petroleum industry by a better knowledge of the maintenance working environment and human factors impact on safety and by profiles determination and improvement strategies identification.

It explores this question through the study of one of the state’s institutions – the maintenance system; its conception of gender identities and relationships is examined. Through a close analysis of this system, and its effects on men and women, the thesis explores the making of contemporary gender identities in South Africa. The study also pays particular attention to current conceptions of what it means to be a man. The study examines men’s views of maintenance laws as they experience it, with a focus on the differing conceptions of fatherhood held by a range of men, and how they relate to hegemonic conceptions of masculinity espoused by <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system.</b> The study also looks at how these hegemonic understandings of masculinity limit the chances for men to be ‘successful’ fathers and fulfilled persons. The central premise of this thesis is that masculinity exists outside the realms of the natural and biological. Rather, it asserts that masculinity is embodied in social relations, which are constantly changing and are context-bound. Naturalised definitions of masculinity are limiting to fathers in a social, political and economic context which is shifting. This study is driven by the question: what options and alternatives are available to men and fathers with regards to role formation, especially in their interaction with <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> and their relationships with their children...|$|E
