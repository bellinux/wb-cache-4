5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to empirically examine the {{comparative}} accuracy of income oriented (Free cash flow to equity, Residual income model) and market oriented (Price <b>to</b> earnings <b>multiple,</b> Price <b>to</b> book value <b>multiple</b> and Price <b>to</b> sales <b>multiple)</b> valuation models for the Indian manufacturing industry, and propose a composite valuation model (CV) to explore whether combining value estimates may improve valuation accuracy. Data are drawn from a sample of 3756 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2012. Findings from the empirically analysis indicate that residual income model is better than free cash flow to equity model under income oriented valuation model, whereas both Price <b>to</b> earnings <b>multiple</b> and Price <b>to</b> book value <b>multiple</b> are superior <b>to</b> Price <b>to</b> sales <b>multiple</b> and are equally likely under market oriented valuation model. Finally, the empirical findings suggest that CV provides better value estimates for Indian manufacturing industry. Further, lag of PE and profitability are the two probable determinants of prediction error of the model...|$|R

5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β subunits, whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed <b>to</b> <b>multiple</b> gene duplication events.|$|E

30|$|The {{synchronization}} challenge {{during the}} first communication phase between the source and the relays {{is similar to that}} presented for SISO multi-carrier systems in Section 2.2. 2. During the second communication phase, the relays decode the received signal and forward it to the destination. Thus, the resulting signal at the destination is affected by <b>multiple</b> <b>TOs</b> and <b>multiple</b> CFOs resulting in strong ISI and ICI. The synchronization challenge is to jointly estimate and compensate for the effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>TOs</b> and <b>multiple</b> CFOs in order to mitigate ISI and ICI.|$|R
