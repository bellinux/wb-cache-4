5|$|Manchester Liners was a cargo and {{passenger}} shipping company founded in 1898, based in Manchester, England. The line pioneered the regular passage of ocean-going vessels along the Manchester Ship Canal. Its main sphere of operation was <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> shipping trade, {{but the company}} also operated services to the Mediterranean. All of the line's vessels were registered in the Port of Manchester, and many were lost to enemy action during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5|$|The initial launch attempt, {{scheduled}} for 11 November 1995 at 7:56am EST (12:56UTC) was postponed due to poor weather at <b>the</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Abort (TAL) site.

5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 1918, Wadsworth {{stood out}} of Brest {{to return to the}} United States and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 9January 1919. Following an {{extended}} overhaul, she put to sea on 1May to serve as one of the picket ships stationed at intervals across the ocean for <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> flight of four Curtiss NC flying boats, one of which, NC-4, successfully completed the feat. The destroyer returned home and operated on the east coast through the summer of 1919. On 29August, Wadsworth was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia where she remained almost two years. On 9May 1921, the destroyer returned to active service along the east coast.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice, {{concerned}} about the additional competition and unable to obtain additional Boeing 707 aircraft any other way, began talks in April 1962 to merge BOAC's North Atlantic operations with those of Cunard Eagle. Agreement was reached in early June 1962 on ownership percentages, and the newly formed company, BOAC-Cunard, began operations later that month. The new airline would operate all <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> services of BOAC and Cunard Eagle from 1962 to 1966. Smallpeice served as {{managing director of the}} joint venture, in addition to his role as managing director of BOAC itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} of the Boeing 707 aircraft would be followed by several orders for Vickers competing design, the VC10, with BOAC having ordered 35 VC10 aircraft by 1959 and an additional ten (bringing the total on order to 45) by 1961. Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and {{a whole host of}} additional costs associated with the Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the British cut <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> {{telegraph}} cable linking the US to Germany {{in order to}} control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>transatlantic</b> African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports {{seems to have had}} no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{began work}} on The Cantos in earnest after {{relocating}} to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in Poetry in June–August 1917. The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in <b>The</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Review in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{as one of}} {{the first}} European {{settlers}} in the Americas, he initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the atrocities committed against the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. In 1515, he reformed his views, gave up his Indian slaves and encomienda, and advocated, before King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West-Indian colonies; consequently, criticisms have been leveled at him as being partly responsible for the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> slave trade. Later in life, he retracted those early views as he came to see all forms of slavery as equally wrong. In 1522, he attempted to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of Venezuela, but this venture failed, causing Las Casas to enter the Dominican Order and become a friar, leaving the public scene for a decade. He then traveled to Central America undertaking peaceful evangelization among the Maya of Guatemala and participated in debates among the Mexican churchmen about how best to bring the natives to the Christian faith.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{the year}} after the war ended, around 60,000 British {{tourists}} and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. <b>The</b> <b>transatlantic</b> voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic—1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.|$|E
