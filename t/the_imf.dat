5|$|In mid-November 2008, Zardari's {{government}} officially sent {{a letter}} of intent to <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008–10. <b>The</b> <b>IMF</b> stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010–11 fiscal year and <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> {{tentatively}} {{agreed to}} lend €1.58 billion. However the loan had still not {{been approved by}} the Executive Board of <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> on 13 November. Due to the delay Iceland found itself caught in a classic catch-22 situation, loans from other countries could not be secured until <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> program had been approved. The Icelandic government spoke of a $500M (€376M) gap in the funding plans. Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos stated that the Netherlands would oppose the loan unless agreement was reached over deposit insurance for Landsbanki customers in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

50|$|Hanke {{recommended}} that Indonesia institute an orthodox currency board, linking the rupiah to the U.S. dollar {{at a fixed}} exchange rate. Hanke supported the reforms contained in <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> package. But, he argued that <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> program would fail unless it was coupled with a currency board arrangement.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>IMFs</b> and <b>the</b> {{residual}} {{signal from}} <b>the</b> first <b>IMF</b> are summed {{up after the}} application of the algorithm to reconstruct the signal. In the de-mixing step of the proposed algorithm, we chose to add the part of the signal extracted from <b>the</b> first <b>IMF</b> to <b>the</b> second <b>IMF.</b> This addition of a part of <b>the</b> first <b>IMF</b> to <b>the</b> second can make <b>the</b> second <b>IMF</b> lose some of its characteristics as a true IMF. Although this does not affect the process of signal reconstruction and does not diminish the quality of the reconstructed signal, it may be important to preserve the characteristics of the EMD decomposition, if further processing of the signal is to be done. As an example we may be interested in the Hilbert-Huang spectrum of <b>the</b> different <b>IMFs.</b>|$|R

5|$|In December 1983, Raúl Alfonsin {{was elected}} President of Argentina, {{bringing}} {{to an end}} to the military dictatorship. Under Alfonsin, negotiations started on a new programme with <b>the</b> <b>IMF,</b> but they led to nothing. In March 1984, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $300 million for three months, followed by a similar amount by the United State. That provided some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> and Argentina.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with <b>the</b> <b>IMF,</b> which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> shortly thereafter. In March 2000, <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> {{agreed to a}} three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan. On 17 June, Tsakalotos warned that Greece {{would not be able to}} repay its €1.6bn loan from <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> at the end of the month unless a new bailout plan was agreed. The {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the bailout deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the bailout plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that while the subsidy reform plan needs further adaptation and fine-tuning, citizens must separate the questions of public policy from the issues of government legitimacy. <b>The</b> <b>IMF</b> has hailed Iran's economic reform and asked Iran's expertise {{to be transferred to}} other countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit has also praised Iran's subsidies reform plan for its positive effect on the economy in 2011.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>IMF</b> forced Madagascar's {{government}} to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization {{of the economy}} when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized {{over the course of}} the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. <b>The</b> <b>IMF</b> agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Peronist Carlos Menem {{was elected}} {{president}} in May 1989.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{empirical}} mode decomposition (EMD) method, which is especially well fitted for analyzing time-series data representing nonstationary and nonlinear processes. This method could decompose any time-varying data into a finite {{set of functions}} called &# 8220;intrinsic mode functions&# 8221; (<b>IMFs).</b> <b>The</b> EMD analysis successively extracts <b>the</b> <b>IMFs</b> with <b>the</b> highest local temporal frequencies in a recursive way. <b>The</b> extracted <b>IMFs</b> represent a set of successive low-pass spatial filters based entirely on the properties exhibited by <b>the</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>IMFs</b> are mutually orthogonal and more effective in isolating physical processes of various time scales. The results showed that most of <b>the</b> <b>IMFs</b> have normal distribution. Therefore, the energy density distribution of IMF samples satisfies &#x 03 C 7; 2 -distribution which is statistically significant. This study suggested that the recent global warming along with decadal climate variability contributes {{not only to the}} more extreme warm events, but also to more frequent, long lasting drought and flood. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Jeffrey Sachs {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>IMF's</b> [...] "usual {{prescription}} is 'budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much {{too poor to}} own belts'".

50|$|This {{admission}} {{has serious}} implications for economies {{such as the}} UK where the OBR used <b>the</b> <b>IMF's</b> assumptions in their economic forecasts {{about the consequences of}} the government's austerity policies.
