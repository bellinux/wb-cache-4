When the performance requirement is low, the supply voltage can be dithered and the circuit can enter from superthreshold region to subthreshold region (Vdd < VT).

The dc link based power conversion systems have several inherent limitations. One of the important limitations is the high switching loss and high device stress which occur during switching intervals. This severely reduces the practical switching frequencies. Additionally, while the cost, size, and weight of the basic voltage sourced PWM drive is attractive, difficulties with input harmonics, output dV/dt and over-voltage, EMI/RFI, <b>tripping</b> with <b>voltage</b> sags, and other problems significantly diminish the economic competiveness of these drives.

An ac-link formed by an inductor-capacitor pair replaces the conventional dc-link. Each leg of the converter is formed by two bidirectional switches. Power transfer from input to output is accomplished via a link inductor which is first charged from the input phases, then discharged to the output phases with a precisely controllable current PWM technique. Capacitance in parallel with the link inductor produces low turn-off losses. Turn-on is always at zero voltage as each switch swings from reverse to forward bias.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of deregulation, {{distributed}} generation will play an increasing role in electric distribution systems. Various new types of Distributed Generation (DG), such as micro-turbines and fuel cells, are now being developed {{in addition to the}} more traditional solar and wind power. A common belief among developers is that DR will improve power quality, and this potential for better quality is cited as one of the value attributes of installing distributed generators. In some cases distributed generation and storage are being promoted as an answer to the premium-quality power requirements of high technology or sensitive end-use customers. Whether or not this value-attribute of DG is valid will depend on the specific technologies, site conditions and potential interaction with the existing electric power system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a technical assessment of the impact of distributed generation technologies on the power quality of the power distribution system. Power quality is a broad term covering a wide range of operating parameters including both steady state and dynamic conditions. The full range of power quality conditions are described in IEEE Std. 1159 - 1995 Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality. This paper focuses on steady-state voltage regulation impacts of DG and is the first of several papers covering the various power quality impacts of DG.

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} processes {{are sensitive to}} power quality problems, due {{to the use of}} power electronic equipment in the power systems. For example, rolling mills are sensitive to voltage disturbances, due to the use of converter drive systems, which <b>trip</b> due to <b>voltage</b> sags. Voltage sag (dip) {{is one of the most}} severe power quality problems. The root cause of voltage sag is a short circuit in the power system, e. g., due to lightning. The consequence of voltage sag may be that expensive power electronic devices are damaged, and the industrial products are scrapped. In order to evaluate the impact of different voltage sags and accompanying economic losses on the {{industrial processes}}, a detailed study of characterization of voltage sags is needed. In this thesis, different methods for the characterization of voltage sags in the single-phase events and three-phase events are studied. The indices for characterizing voltage sags are discussed in terms of voltage magnitude, sag duration, and phase-angle jump, for both the single-phase events and the three-phase events. For the latter case, the characteristic voltage, the ABC classification and the symmetrical component classification are also analyzed. Theoretical, simulation and experimental studies have been done to compare the results from different indices, based on four generic configurations constructed in the analog network. The simulation tool is PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation results have shown accordance with the theoretical and experimental results with an acceptable error. It also has been shown in the three-phase events that the results of the minimum retained voltage and the magnitude of the characteristic voltage are identical for the sag type A and E, but not for the sag type B and C. The results also indicate that for the ideal sag type A, B, C and E, the phase-angle jump of the characteristic voltage is equal to that of the symmetrical phase voltage. However, this equivalence will not be valid if there is asymmetry of the other two phases with respect to the symmetrical phase. The effect of induction machine on voltage sags in terms of sag magnitude, phase-angle jump, and jump of the transmission angle is discussed intensively. The voltage data recorded by phasor measurement unit (PMU) and power quality monitor (PQ monitor) are analyzed and compared. The results of the voltage magnitude recorded by PMU are in accordance with those recorded by PQ monitor. However, the results of phase-angle jump are not in accordance with each other, due to the low sampling frequency of PMU. Finally, the voltages sag types are summarized according to the ABC classification and the symmetrical component classification. However, the algorithm of the latter classification may lead to erroneous results due to the impact of the load condition...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of wind {{generation}} facilities in the utility system is fast increasing, many issues associated with their integration into the power system are beginning to emerge. Of the various issues, this dissertation deals {{with the development of}} new concepts and computational methods to handle the transmission issues and voltage issues caused by large-scale integration of wind turbines. This dissertation also formulates a probabilistic framework for the steady-state security assessment of wind power incorporating the forecast uncertainty and correlation. Transmission issues are mainly related to the overloading of transmission lines, when all the wind power generated cannot be delivered in full due to prior outage conditions. To deal with this problem, a method to curtail the wind turbine outputs through Energy Management System facilities in the on-line operational environment is proposed. The proposed method, which is based on linear optimization, sends the calculated control signals via the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system to wind farm controllers. The necessary ramping of the wind farm outputs is implemented either by the appropriate blade pitch angle control at the turbine level or by switching a certain number of turbines. The curtailment strategy is tested with an equivalent system model of MidAmerican Energy Company. The results show that the line overload in high wind areas can be alleviated by controlling the outputs of the wind farms step-by-step over an allowable period of time. A low voltage event during a system fault can cause a large number of wind turbines to <b>trip,</b> depending on <b>voltages</b> at the wind turbine terminals during the fault and the under-voltage protection setting of wind turbines. As a result, an N- 1 contingency may evolve into an N-(K+ 1) contingency, where K is {{the number of}} wind farms tripped due to low voltage conditions. Losing a large amount of wind power following a line contingency might lead to system instabilities. It is important for the system operator to be aware of such limiting events during system operation and be prepared to take proper control actions. This can be achieved by incorporating the wind farm tripping status for each contingency as part of the static security assessment. A methodology to calculate voltages at the wind farm buses during a worst case line fault is proposed, which, along with the protection settings of wind turbines, can be used to determine the tripping of wind farms. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and tested with MidAmerican Energy reduced network. The result shows that a large amount of wind capacity can be tripped due to a fault in the lines. A probabilistic framework to handle the uncertainty in day-ahead forecast error in order to correctly assess the steady-state security of the power system is presented. Stochastic simulations are conducted by means of Latin Hypercube sampling along with the consideration of correlations. The correlation is calculated from the historical distribution of wind power forecast errors. The results from the deterministic simulation based on point forecast and the stochastic simulation show that security assessment based solely on deterministic simulations can lead to incorrect assessment of system security. With stochastic simulations, each outcome can be assigned a probability and the decision regarding control actions can be made based on the associated probability...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} of {{distributed}} generation (DG) on steady state operation and control of power distribution systems is investigated. Over the last few years, {{a number of factors}} have led to an increased interest in DG schemes. DG is gaining more and more attention worldwide as an alternative to large-scale central generating stations. A number of DG technologies {{are in a position to}} compete with central generating stations. There are also likely opportunities for renewable energy technologies in DG. Indeed, some renewable energy based DG technologies are not yet generally cost-competitive. However, technology development may lead to major innovative progress in materials, processes, designs and products, with higher efficiency and cost reduction opportunities. In electric power systems with large central generating stations, the electric power flows in one way direction: from generation stations to transmission systems, then to distribution systems and finally to the loads. Therefore, distribution systems were designed as radial systems; and many operation and control in distribution systems, such as voltage control and protection, are based on the assumption that distribution systems are radial. In a radial distribution feeder, voltage decreases towards the end of the feeder, as loads cause a voltage drop. However, it will be altered with the presence of DG. DG will increase the voltage at its connection point, which in turn will increase the voltage profile along the feeder. This increase may exceed the maximum allowed voltage when the DG power is high. One way to mitigate this overvoltage is when DG absorbs reactive power from the grid. This method is effective for mitigation of overvoltage-caused DG in low voltage (LV) feeders where the mean of voltage control is obtained from an off-load tap changer. However, if DG absorbs reactive power, feeder losses will increase. The maximum DG that can be integrated in a feeder (DG integration limit) is limited by maximum allowed voltage variation, conductor thermal ampacity and upstream transformer rating. The DG integration limit is usually defined based on maximum DG and minimum load scenario. However, when DG and load power fluctuate throughout the day, this scenario will lead to unnecessary restriction of DG integration. Minimum load and maximum DG may not happen at the same time. Stochastic assessment using Monte Carlo simulations will be more reliable to determine the DG integration limit in this circumstance. In medium voltage (MV) feeder, where the voltage control is normally achieved by using on-load tap changer (LTC) and capacitor banks; the mitigation of overvoltage-caused DG can be obtained by coordinating DG with the LTC and capacitors. The use of line drop compensation (LDC), which is present in most LTCs but often not used, can also mitigate the overvoltage. When the LDC is coordinated properly with DGs, LDC will even extend the DG integration limit. The DG integration limit in a MV feeder can also be extended by allowing DG to absorb reactive power as in an LV feeder, or by installing a voltage regulator (VR). However, if DG absorbs reactive power, it means that the reactive power should be generated somewhere else in the system, and VR installation means investment cost. The DG integration limit can also be extended by operating the MV feeders in a meshed system (closed-loop). The expense of this meshed operation is that the protection of the feeder is more complicated. The presence of DG will obviously increase residual voltage (dip magnitude) during a short circuit. However, depending on the location of the DG relative to the protection device (PD) and fault, DG may shorten or lengthen the duration of the short circuit, which directly correlates to dip duration. This is because, the location of the DG relative to the PD and fault defines whether DG will increase or decrease the short circuit current sensed by PD. However, PDs in distribution systems are normally overcurrent (OC) based PDs, which clear the fault in a certain time delay depending on the short circuit current sensed by them. Thus, though DG increases dip magnitude, further investigation on coordination of voltage dip and OC protection is needed to investigate whether the DG will prevent sensitive equipment from <b>tripping,</b> due to <b>voltage</b> dip, or not. Protection coordination in distribution systems can be affected by the increasing or decreasing short circuit current sensed by PDs. Certain corrective actions are then needed. However, when the DG is not expected to be in islanding operation; DG still has to be disconnected from distribution systems every time a fault occurs, even if all corrective actions have been implemented. Disconnecting all DGs every time a temporary fault occurs would make the system very unreliable. This is especially because most of the faults in overhead distribution systems are temporary. Thus, when the DG is not expected to be in islanding operation, a protection scheme that can keep DG on line to supply the load during the fault is necessary. The scheme should ensure that the OC PDs in on the feeder can clear the fault without loosing their proper coordination...|$|R
