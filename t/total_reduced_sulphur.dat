Results: In this study, a hyperthermophilic sulphur-oxidizing strain of archaea was isolated from a hot spring (Chillán, Chile) and designated as M 1. It was identified as archaea of the genus Sulfolobus (99 % homology with S. solfataricus 16 S rDNA).

Other parameters such as chlorophyll a, water temperature, and wind speed were also measured. DMS concentration ranges 0. 85 – 15. 0 nmol S ly 1 at Stn. 1 and 0. 40 – 16. 3 nmol S ly 1 at Stn. 2. showed two relative maxima in the spring–summer period, probably connected to phytoplanktonic and macro-algal blooms. Low and constant values were observed in autumn, whereas the maximum concentration was observed in the late winter period. The CS 2 concentration ranges 0. 17 – 2. 8 nmol S ly 1 at Stn. 1 and 0. 08 – 2. 0 nmol S ly 1 at Stn. 2. increased in the spring, was maximal in summer and then decreased in autumn, with a different trend from that of DMS, suggesting that the production {{and the fate of}} CS 2 and DMS in water are different.

40|$|The Nippers Harbour Ophiolite is a southwesterly {{extension}} of the lower Ordovician Betts Cove Ophiolite. Extensive sheeted dyke and gabbro members, as well as minor ultramafic components, characterize the Nippers Harbour Ophiolite. The ophiolite is unconformably overlain by the Silurian Cape St. John Group, which consists of subaerial conglomerates, cross-bedded sandstones, basic pyroclastics and andesitic to rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs. The ophiolite also is intruded by the Late Silurian to Early Devonian Cape Brule quartz-feldspar Porphyry. The mafic members of the Nippers Harbour Ophiolite show similarities to Betts Cove boninite-type lavas in that they contain unusually low TiO₂ and high SiO₂, MgO, Cr and Ni contents. [...] Mineralization is located commonly in shear or fault zones in mafic ophiolitic rocks. The Hill showing has characteristics resembling those of massive sulphide stockwork zones, with pyrite-chalcopyrite-quartz-chlorite breccia and sheared rock, surrounded by fragments of hydrothermally altered quartz-chlorite-albite rock. Relatively unaltered diabase dykes intrude these assemblages. The altered rocks have been enriched in FeOt, Cu and Zn, and depleted in Na₂O, CaO, Sr and LREE. Mineralization {{is believed to have}} been formed by the mixing of upwelling, hot, Fe-, Cu-, Zn-enriched seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids with cold seawater at the diabase-pillow basalt interface. [...] Anomalous gold contents have been documented at Burtons Pond, Gull Pond and Showing Number 2. The gold is spatially related to sulphides, mainly chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite, which have precipitated with quartz-calcite, quartz-albite and quartz in veins in altered host rocks. Three alteration assemblages are recognized: (1) quartz-chlorite+/-albite, (2) quartz-chlorite-sericite and (3) quartz-sericite-calcite. Only the Burtons Pond showing displays all three assemblages, whilst the others are associated with assemblage (2). The alteration is expressed chemically by the addition of FeOt, S, K₂O, CO₂, Au, Ag, As, Ba, Co, Cu, Se and Zn, and variable depletions of CaO, Sr and Na₂O. Fluid inclusion and sulphur isotope data (ranging from 4. 5 to 6. 7 per mil) suggest that the fluids were seawater-derived and had the following characteristics: temperature ~ 250 °C, pH 5, <b>total</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>sulphur</b> < 10 ⁻³M, aO₂ < 10 ⁻⁴² and aS₂ < 10 ⁻¹³. ⁵. Gold probably was carried predominantly as a thio-complex, but it also may have been a chloride- or thio-arsenide complex. Mineralization is believed to have formed by movement of seawater-derived fluids along shallow thrust planes, depositing sulphides and gold with associated chlorite and sericite, in splays. [...] Other sulphide showings include Pb-Zn and Cu-bearing quartz veins at Welshs Bight and Rogues Harbour respectively. Field evidence and sulphur and lead isotope data (- 0. 4 to 2. 9 per mil, and ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb = 17. 659, ²⁰⁷Pb/²⁰⁴Pb = 15. 464, ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁴Pb = 37. 562 respectively) suggest that these showings are related to the intrusion of the Cape Brule Porphyry...|$|E
40|$|A local {{integrated}} {{pulp and}} paper Kraft mill had come {{under pressure from the}} local communities and mill personnel to reduce the odours that were perceived to be generated at the Farm Dams and irrigation farm situated adjacent to the mill. The typical odours associated with Kraft mills are due to the generation of four reduced sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), methyl-mercaptan (CH 3 SH), dimethyl-sulphide (CH 3) 2 S and dimethyl-disulphide (CH 3) 2 S 2. These compounds are collectively referred to as <b>Total</b> <b>Reduced</b> <b>Sulphur</b> (TRS) components which are generated {{as a direct result of}} the Kraft pulping and chemical recovery process. These components can either be in the gaseous or aqueous phase depending on the characteristics of the effluent. Gaseous and aqueous TRS profiling of the mill indicated that hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) was the main odour component generated and emitted from the Clarifiers and the Treated Effluent Transfer Sump (TETS) at the effluent treatment plant. The hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) emission levels were affected by process upsets, sludge removal frequencies, chemical composition of the effluent, Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) activity, pH and temperature fluctuations. Treatment options such as pH control using slaked lime, dosing of biocides, addition of biomodifiers and/or a sulphate reduction inhibitor were investigated. The use of slaked lime, Ca(OH) 2, for pH control was not practical due to continuous pH fluctuations, increasing the pH would increase the scaling tendencies of the effluent and would also affect the soil cation-anion exchange properties of the irrigated farm land. The use of non-oxidising biocides was effective in reducing SRB activity between 99. 2 % and 99. 8 % at dosages between 4 mg/l and 25 mg/l. However, the use of biocides was not considered as a long term treatment option due to the various disadvantages such as the stability of the biocides at fluctuating pH and temperatures, half-life, environmental accumulation, toxicity and costs. The aqueous H 2 S level was reduced by 79 % using different combinations of biomodifiers (nitrates, nitrites, molybdenum). Increasing the dosages of the biomodifiers (> 500 mg/l) would be required to increase the reduction of H 2 S levels by more than 79 %. The increased dosages would significantly increase the cost of the treatment programme. The accumulation of nitrates, nitrites and molybdenum could affect the soil texture, cation-anion exchange capacity, permeability, Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) and nutrient availability. A more environmentally friendly and cost effective treatment was found using sodium nitrate (biomodifier) together with AQ (sulphate reduction inhibitor). The continuous dosing of 50 mg/l sodium nitrate together with 4 mg/l AQ would be effective in reducing the average aqueous H 2 S levels (40 mg/l) by at least 92 %. This treatment would also be compatible with aeration or oxidation procedures to further increase the removal of H 2 S to achieve an aqueous H 2 S level of < 1 mg/l. Aeration or oxidation would also increase the dissolved oxygen and COD levels, increase the inhibition of SRB activity and oxidise any reduced sulphur. The dosing of sodium nitrate and AQ to control the generation of H 2 S is not patented in South Africa. It can, therefore, be used to treat the Kraft mill effluent without violating any intellectual property rights in South Africa. Dissertation (MSc(Applied Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
