5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World.

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War.</b> <b>In</b> 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E

5|$|In 1153 or 1154, Chesney was the {{recipient}} of the lordship of a hundred and a half in Norfolk, possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham.

While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
