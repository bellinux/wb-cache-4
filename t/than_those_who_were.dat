In this work, Bandura found that children exposed to an aggressive adult model acted more aggressively <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> exposed to a nonaggressive adult model. This experiment suggests that anyone who comes in contact with and interacts with children can affect the way they react and handle situations.|$|E

According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{survey to}} examine whether or not people who {{believed}} in evolution {{were more likely to}} support animal rights than creationists and believers in intelligent design found that this was largely the case – according to the researchers, the respondents who were strong Christian fundamentalists and believers in creationism were less likely to advocate for animal rights <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were atheists or agnostic.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who were made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} {{subjects}} recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 {{study also found that}} environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.|$|E
25|$|Although {{opinions}} differ, others {{suggest that}} sexual activity {{is an essential}} part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. Sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction. In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity according to one particular research study. In a rural upstate New York community, a cross-sectional study of teenagers was completed in 2008 and 2009. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.|$|E

25|$|Often {{a single}} {{predominant}} religion {{can influence the}} culture of an entire nation. Even within Christianity in the United States, there are discrepancies as to how extramarital affairs are viewed. For instance, Protestants and Catholics do not view infidelity with equal severity. The conception of marriage is also markedly different; while in Roman Catholicism marriage {{is seen as an}} indissoluble sacramental bond and does not permit divorce even in cases of infidelity, most Protestant denominations allow for divorce and remarriage for infidelity or other reasons. Ultimately, it was seen that adults that associated with a religion (any denomination) were found to view infidelity as much more distressing <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not affiliated with a religion. Those that participated more heavily in their religions were even more conservative in their views on infidelity (Burdette et al. 2007).|$|E
25|$|This {{can occur}} {{even if the}} subject is not {{conscious}} of the priming stimulus. An example of this was done by Bargh et al. in 1996. Subjects were implicitly primed with words related to the stereotype of elderly people (example: Florida, forgetful, wrinkle). While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed with these words walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> primed with neutral stimuli. Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words {{were more likely to}} interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt. A Yale study showed that something as simple as holding a hot or cold beverage before an interview could result in pleasant or negative opinion of the interviewer. However, there has been a serious lack of replication (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{units that}} were {{considered}} to be the most reliable and loyal by Wang Jingwei included the three Guards divisions in Nanjing (about 10,000 men per division), the 1st Front Army (about 20,000 men), based throughout the Lower Yangtze, and the Taxation Police Corps (about 3,000 men), which had been raised personally by Zhou Fohai and were loyal to him. The Capital Guards Divisions were formed from an independent brigade created in May 1941 in Nanjing, which was considered a success and raised {{to the size of a}} division. Shortly afterwards another two divisions were created. These Guards units were given the best equipment, weapons, and uniforms, with a personal loyalty to Wang himself. The Taxation Police Corps was created in Shanghai by Finance Minister Zhou Fohai for his own protection and owed its loyalty to him, and he sought to raise its quality to that of a regular IJA division. It increased in size from 3,000 to around 20,000 men. They, like Wang's Capital Guard divisions, received some of the best supplies and were highly regarded as among the Nanjing regime's best units. They were later moved out of Shanghai and were used for fighting guerillas. Morale and reliability of the average Nanjing Army units was a matter of their location. Intelligence reports from 1944 indicate that those units who were stationed near Nanjing and took orders from Wang Jingwei's government were more effective and motivated <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> further away and commanded by others.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{there were}} reforms in rape laws and special units to prosecute rape crimes, rape was a {{difficult}} case to prosecute as a crime; {{this is due to}} issue of consent, [...] the need to provide sufficient evidence to charge the accused, and sometime biased cultural depictions of sexuality and gender. The prosecution largely relies on organizations, advocacy groups, or social movements such as the Anti-rape movement in order to be effective. The difficulties can also bring negative consequences upon the victims. For example in the United States, a study in the 1980s found that the rape victims who went through the prosecution system had a slower recovery process <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not prosecuted.|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol {{dependence}} has a far reaching {{impact on}} health outcomes. [...] A study conducted in Germany in 2016 found the economic burden for those dependent on alcohol was 50% higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not. [...] In the study, {{over half of}} the economic cost was due to lost productivity, and only 6% was due to alcohol treatment programs. [...] The economic cost was mostly borne by individuals between 30 – 49 years old. In another study conducted with data from eight European countries, 77% of alcohol dependent patients suffered from psychiatric and somatic co-morbidity, which in turn increased systematic healthcare and economic cost. [...] Alcohol consumption can also affect the immune system and produce complications in people suffering from HIV, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Dr. Sokhna et al. {{performed}} {{a study of}} Senegalese children. Those infected with blood flukes had significantly higher rates of malaria attacks <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not. Furthermore, children with the highest counts of blood flukes also had the most malaria attacks. Based on this study, Dr. Hartgers et al. drew a [...] "cautious conclusion" [...] that helminths make humans more susceptible to contracting malaria and experiencing some of its lighter symptoms, while actually protecting them from the worst symptoms. Hartgers reasons that a Th2-skewed immune system resulting from helminth infection would lower the immune system's ability to counter an initial malarial infection. However, it would also prevent a hyperimmune response resulting in severe inflammation, reducing morbidity and pathology.|$|E

2500|$|The preparations, and {{the many}} works of art {{commissioned}} for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, {{had an effect on}} public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as the lavish Tournament of Brussels in 1905, and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by [...] Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe: it was attempting [...] "to be a living re-enactment of the literary romances". In Eglinton’s own words [...] "I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition— more perhaps <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{assert that}} the {{official}} U.S. poverty definition is inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens {{and the rest of}} the world, because the U.S. government considers many citizens statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet their basic needs. According to a heavily criticised 2011 paper by The Heritage Foundation research fellow Robert Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed [...] by the U.S. Census Bureau to be below the poverty level in 2009, the majority had adequate shelter, food, clothing and medical care. In addition, the paper stated that those assessed as below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty. For example, in 2005, 63.7% of those living in poverty had cable or satellite television. In some cases the report even said that people currently living in poverty were actually better off than middle class people of the recent past. For example, in 2005, 78.3% of households living in poverty had air conditioning, whereas in 1970, 36.0% of all households had air conditioning.|$|E
2500|$|McKenna's {{hypothesis}} was that low doses of psilocybin improve visual acuity, {{meaning that the}} presence of psilocybin in the diet of early pack hunting primates caused the individuals who were consuming psilocybin mushrooms to be better hunters <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not, resulting in an increased food supply and in turn a higher rate of reproductive success. Then at slightly higher doses, he contended, the mushroom acts to sexually arouse, leading to a higher level of attention, more energy in the organism, and potential erection in the males, rendering it even more evolutionarily beneficial, as it would result in more offspring. At even higher doses, McKenna proposed that the mushroom would have acted to [...] "dissolve boundaries," [...] promoting community bonding and group sexual activities. Consequently, there would be a mixing of genes, greater genetic diversity, and a communal sense of responsibility for the group offspring. At these higher doses, McKenna also argued that psilocybin would be triggering activity in the [...] "language-forming region of the brain", manifesting as music and visions, thus catalyzing the emergence of language in early hominids by expanding [...] "their arboreally evolved repertoire of troop signals." [...] He also pointed out that psilocybin would dissolve the ego and [...] "religious concerns would be {{at the forefront of the}} tribe's consciousness, simply because of the power and strangeness of the experience itself." ...|$|E
