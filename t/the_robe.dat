50|$|She {{served as}} Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> to <b>the</b> under age monarch, queen Christina, in 1633-1634. After {{the death of}} the queens foster mother and aunt, Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg in 1638, the council decided that the queen should have not one, but two foster mothers, as well as two {{mistress}} of <b>the</b> <b>robes.</b> <b>The</b> reason for splitting these two positions in four, was the wish that Christina should not be dependent upon one single individual and favorite. In 1639, the position of Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> was thereby shared between Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning (though the former was given a higher rank), and the position of foster mother was shared by Ebba Mauritzdotter Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag. Formally, however, also Leijonhufvud and Natt och Dag was given the title of Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> in name though not in regard to their task. This order meant a change in the Swedish royal court: during the reign of Christina, she continued to have several Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> in parallel, and after her reign, a new court protocol was instigated were it became the custom to have one high ranked Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> called overhovmastarinna (Chief Court Mistress) over several, normally two, of lower rank called hovmastarinna (Court Mistress), which had previously been the title for the only Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} the {{baldachin}} shows strong south French influence, and borrows many features from the tympanum of Moissac Abbey, especially in <b>the</b> <b>robes</b> of Christ. <b>The</b> <b>robes</b> of <b>the</b> angels, however, and the hairstyles of all the figures are more typically Iberian.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{other members}} of the royal family wear {{distinctive}} robes, most particularly queens consort (including dowagers) and princesses of the United Kingdom, all of whom wear purple velvet mantles edged with ermine over their court dresses. Other {{members of the royal family}} in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that royal dukes wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of ermine on the cape and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of <b>the</b> <b>robe.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} items {{pertaining}} to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

5|$|The {{sovereign}} then {{exits the}} coronation theatre, entering StEdward's Chapel (within the abbey), preceded by the bearers of the Sword of State, the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice and the blunt Sword of Mercy. While the monarch is in St. Edward's chapel, the choir recites an English {{translation of the}} hymn of thanksgiving Te Deum laudamus. St Edward's Crown {{and all the other}} regalia are laid on the High Altar of the chapel; the sovereign removes <b>the</b> <b>Robe</b> Royal and Stole Royal, exchanges the crimson surcoat for the purple surcoat and is enrobed in the Imperial Robe of purple velvet. He or she then wears the Imperial State Crown and takes into his or her hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel while all present sing the national anthem.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{whenever}} the queen was a queen regnant {{rather than a}} queen consort, the Mistress of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> was a political appointment, changing with the government. However, {{this has not been}} the case since the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, and Queen Elizabeth II has only had two Mistresses of <b>the</b> <b>Robes</b> in more than sixty years' reign. Queens dowager have their own Mistresses of <b>the</b> <b>Robes,</b> and in <b>the</b> 18th century Princesses of Wales had one too.|$|R

5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing <b>the</b> <b>robe</b> for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. <b>The</b> <b>robe</b> worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E
5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, <b>The</b> <b>Robe,</b> The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E
