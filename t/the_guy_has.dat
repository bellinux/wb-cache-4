500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key".

500|$|Within {{three weeks}} of his first game as a starter, at least seven e-books were being {{published}} on Lin, and the Global Language Monitor declared that Linsanity had met its criteria to be considered an English-language word. He appeared on a second consecutive Sports Illustrated cover, the first New York-based team athlete and the third NBA player in the magazine's history, after Jordan and Dirk Nowitzki. New York City restaurants introduced new food and bar items in honor of Lin, and sales of Yanjing Beer rose.

2500|$|To me, the Robo quarterback means <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>has</b> all the equipment, {{the father}} said. Everything in sync. Everything balanced. The perfect machine.
