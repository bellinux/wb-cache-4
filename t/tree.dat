5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} <b>tree.</b> As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host <b>tree</b> and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host <b>tree.</b> This usually results {{in the death of}} the host <b>tree,</b> since it effectively girdles the <b>tree.</b> Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients.

5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the minimum spanning <b>tree</b> allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian <b>tree.</b> The {{root of the}} Cartesian <b>tree</b> represents the heaviest minimum spanning <b>tree</b> edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning <b>tree</b> formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian <b>tree</b> represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian <b>tree</b> node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning <b>tree</b> edges have been sorted, this Cartesian <b>tree</b> can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

40|$|This survey studies asymptotics {{of random}} fringe <b>trees</b> and {{extended}} fringe <b>trees</b> in random <b>trees</b> {{that can be}} constructed as family <b>trees</b> of a Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process, stopped at a suitable time. This includes random recursive <b>trees,</b> preferential attachment <b>trees,</b> fragmentation <b>trees,</b> binary search <b>trees</b> and (more generally) $m$-ary search <b>trees,</b> {{as well as some}} other classes of random <b>trees.</b> We begin with general results, mainly due to Aldous (1991) and Jagers and Nerman (1984). The general results are applied to fringe <b>trees</b> and extended fringe <b>trees</b> for several particular types of random <b>trees,</b> where the theory is developed in detail. In particular, we consider fringe <b>trees</b> of $m$-ary search <b>trees</b> in detail; this seems to be new. Various applications are given, including degree distribution, protected nodes and maximal clades for various types of random <b>trees.</b> Again, we emphasise results for $m$-ary search <b>trees,</b> and give for example new results on protected nodes in $m$-ary search <b>trees.</b> A separate section surveys results on height, saturation level, typical depth and total path length, due to Devroye (1986), Biggins (1995, 1997) and others.

40|$|Aims Many {{mechanisms}} of forest patterns {{have been examined}} in tropical rain forest; however, {{there are only a}} handful of similar studies on subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest. Our objective is to analyze the main {{mechanisms of}} distribution pattern of Castanopsis eyrei and Schima superba in GTS (Gutianshan) forest plot. Methods Based on a stem map of a 24 hm 2 permanent plot in the middle subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest at Gutianshan National Reserve, we analyzed the distribution pattern of the dominant species C. eyrei and S. superba in saplings, juvenile <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees,</b> large <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees</b> using spatial point pattern analysis. We also examined spatial associations among different growth stages. Important findings Castanopsis eyrei and S. superba had a clustered distribution across a range of scales (0 – 100 m). Saplings, juvenile <b>trees</b> and adult <b>trees</b> tended to be more clumped than big <b>trees.</b> Old <b>trees</b> tended to be somewhat more clumped than big <b>trees.</b> Our results suggested that the two species have obvious habitat preferences at larger scales. For C. eyrei, saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings and adult <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> and adult <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> and big <b>trees.</b> Generally there was no correlation between big <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 10 m, whereas their association tended to be positive at larger scales (10 – 100 m). Generally there were negative or no correlations between other size classes. For S. superba, the saplings were significantly positively associated with juvenile <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 100 m, as were saplings and adult <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> and adult <b>trees.</b> Generally there were negative or no correlations between juvenile <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees,</b> big <b>trees</b> and old <b>trees,</b> saplings and big <b>trees,</b> juvenile <b>trees</b> and big <b>trees,</b> adult <b>trees</b> and big <b>trees.</b> Generally there was negative correlation between saplings and old <b>trees</b> at scales ≤ 20 m, whereas their association tended to be positively at larger scales (25 – 100 m). These results suggested that dominant species facilitated coexistence of other species through emptying space for colonization of other species, which is probably attributed to density dependence or the Janzen-Connell effect. Both processes depended on species in intensity and acting time...|$|R
