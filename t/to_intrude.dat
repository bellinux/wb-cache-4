5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear <b>to</b> <b>intrude,</b> on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
25|$|Arabian sailors began <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> {{into the}} Bay of Bengal {{as early as}} the 8th century, and later Portuguese, Dutch, English and French ships became dominant, {{reducing}} the sailors of Orissa to the coastal trade.|$|E
25|$|The burials {{generally}} appear <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> into occupation midden deposits, {{and researchers}} have determined {{it difficult to}} make particular inferences from them; only noting that in later Andean periods, child burials were often associated with fertility rituals.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} Orange County {{which is located}} in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in {{indirect}} potable reuse. A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> seawater.|$|R
5000|$|Sound masking is dynamic (variable) as are {{the sounds}} it is {{intended}} to block. Building elements that provide sound attenuation are static (fixed) and cannot adapt <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> sounds that change in level. Masking can vary from location to location as well as from time to time, to adapt to changing environmental conditions.|$|R

Readers are privy to their thoughts but not {{those of the other}} characters in the scene, not even Cal or Conrad if they happen <b>to</b> <b>intrude.</b> The narrative frequently goes into patches of italicized interior monologue and stream of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Plume {{magmatism}} is {{an effective}} mechanism for explaining the large volumes of magmatism required to inflate an intrusion to several kilometres thickness (up to and greater than 13 kilometres). Plumes also tend to create warping of the crust, weaken it thermally {{so that it is}} easier <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> magma and create space to host the intrusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} {{small size of}} Little Bear Mountain and its close connection with Hoodoo Mountain indicates it is a parasitic cone. Such geographical features are formed when the vent of the main volcanic edifice (i.e. Hoodoo Mountain) is blocked by cooled and solidified lava, forcing magma <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> into the lines of weakness {{at the side of}} the main volcanic edifice under pressure.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the ability to inhibit already processed and actually irrelevant information influences performance in the reading span task (RST). French versions of the Stroop color-word task and of the Daneman and Carpenter's RST were administered to 151 participants,from 30 to 80 years. In addition to the traditional span score, a score of vulnerability to intrusions was also computed as the number of intruding responses (words from preceding trials of the RST or nonfinal words). An analysis of variance showed a significant age effect on the reading span and on the resistance to interference, but no significant age effect on the vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> responses. A multiple-regression analysis was also made with the reading span score as the dependent variable, and with age, vulnerability to intrusions, and resistance to Stroop interference as independent variables. This analysis revealed that there was a relation between participants' vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> responses and their working memory span scores; the contribution of age and resistance to interference were very weak. In conclusion the present findings first support the idea that the working memory capacity undoubtedly involves some inhibitory control; however, because the participants' vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> responses is not clearly affected by age, the present findings also suggest that some part of age effects upon the working memory span has to be explained by another factor than a growing inefficiency in inhibitory control...|$|R
50|$|In September 1944 No. 85 Squadron {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> over Germany {{and supporting}} RAF Bomber Command. Burbridge {{was awarded a}} bar to his DFC in October 1944 and a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) the following month. From September 1944 to January 1945, Burbridge claimed 13 enemy night fighter aircraft destroyed—including four in one night. In February 1945 both men were awarded a bar to their DSO.|$|R
50|$|In 1808, {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy frigate HMS Phaeton entered Nagasaki Harbor {{in search of}} Dutch trading ships. The local {{magistrate}} was unable to resist the British demand for food, fuel, and water, later committing seppuku as a result. Laws were passed {{in the wake of}} this incident strengthening coastal defenses, threatening death <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> foreigners, and prompting the training of English and Russian translators.|$|R
25|$|Bella moth {{caterpillars}} {{may have}} the ability to recognize other larvae as kin, as larvae are less likely <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> upon siblings than non-siblings established in seedpods. However, siblings {{are also more likely to}} be similar in age and fighting ability. Therefore, larvae may not be recognizing kin but may simply be less likely to invade others of the same age and/or fighting ability.|$|E
25|$|Lou's {{affinity}} {{and ties}} with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and thinks that gives her an excuse <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> into people's business as she sees fit. She is great friends with Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), her lifelong neighbours. She also has {{a good relationship with}} the local general practitioner, Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) and an old Jewish pawnbroker known only as 'Uncle' (Leonard Maguire).|$|E
25|$|Some {{organizations}} or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing {{a more inclusive}} language policy either via official multilingualism, or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to {{discrimination on the basis}} of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom “to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.” Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.|$|E
5000|$|Llyra {{was seen}} in the [...] "Marvel Tarot" [...] mini-series, {{focusing}} on magic-related characters. Here she had been supplanted by her rival Nagala as high-priestess of Set, as well as transformed into a guardian sea-hag due to her god's displeasure. At the end Nagala likewise falls out of favor as she loses the Serpent Crown <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> wizard Ian McNee, and the two fight over becoming Set's favored concubine.|$|R

25|$|The {{deterioration}} of crowd behavior in Australia {{has been marked}} and easily observable {{over the last few}} years...Exhibitionists, generally in drunken stupor, invaded the pitches...attempted to run the gauntlet of policemen patrolling the perimeter. When they intruded upon the playing area to congratulate their heros, their sincereity extended to trying to steal their caps or snitching a bail or stump whilst the umpire was distracted by his concern for the pitch...umpire Brooks and an intruder clashed physically in the centre of the Test pitch. The invader was sent sprawling in the centre of the wicket by an exesperated umpire, who was no doubt unwise <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> into the domain of law and order.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely <b>to</b> <b>intrude.</b> As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E
25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing {{the most disturbing}} elements of a traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E
25|$|Between 1955 and 1972, the BFS {{played a}} front-line role in {{managing}} tensions {{on the inner}} German border. Its officers were called {{to the scene of}} border incidents or unusual activity to defuse disputes and provide an independent British view of situations. They dealt {{with a wide variety of}} incidents ranging from escapes over the East German border fortifications, <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> East German border markers, or attempts to block West German boats along the disputed river border on the Elbe. West German customs or Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS Federal Border Protection) personnel would deal directly with the East Germans with the BFS officer providing advice.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} to present a security-related {{motivation}} for compiler verification, and in particular for binary compiler implementation verification. We will prove that source level verification is not sufficient in order to guarantee compiler correctness. For this, we will adopt the scenario of a well-known attack to Unix operating system programs due <b>to</b> <b>intruded</b> Trojan Horses in compiler executables. Such a compiler will pass nearly every test, {{state of the art}} compiler validation, the strong bootstrap test, any amount of source code inspection and verification, but for all that, it nevertheless might eventually cause a catastrophe...|$|R
50|$|The {{courts were}} divided over whether such {{tracking}} amounted <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> in a person’s personal sphere. Some courts decided that such tracking to obtain cell site location data implicated the Fourth Amendment, and applied the 'probable cause' standard stipulated under the Fourth Amendment to such cases- In re Application of the United States F. Supp. 2d 113 (E.D.N.Y. 2011), In re Application of the United States F. Supp. 2d 827 (S.D. Tex. 2010). These courts however also clarified that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated if {{the request for}} acquisition of cell site location information is {{for a short period}} of time.|$|R
25|$|The Intercaldera Sequence {{comprises}} formations that crop {{out from}} overlying flows in triangularly shaped area, and includes thick volcanic ash (tuff), thick breccia layers, and intermediate to felsic igneous rocks that tend <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> the above layers and are typically located along caldera margin faults. The Exocaldera Sequence contains ash flow tuffs, mafic lavas, alluvial redbeds, and porphyritic felsic lavas that are distributed across five different layers. The late Caldera-Fill Sequence contains rocks {{that are similar}} to those of the outflows of the other, older layers, and comprises two formations and two relatively minor intrusive lava flows. The volcanic flows are generally mafic. The stratigraphic subdivision is supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, which indicate that the basaltic rocks are mantle-derived and have, unusually, relatively intraplate (or hotspot) type chemical affinities. The multiple andesite flows were probably derived from basaltic magma by the crystallization of the magma material. The relatively rare, more felsic flow units, are thought to have originated from high-end crystallization inside the magma chamber. The various stages of fractionation are continually interrupted by eruptions, and have allowed scientists to recognize seven stages of caldera development. The genesis of the caldera is related to a period of lithospheric thinning that followed the Acadian Orogeny in the northern Appalachians.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine. Sir Edward Coke, in Semayne's case (1604), famously stated: [...] "The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and {{violence}} as for his repose." [...] Semayne's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> on his subjects' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.|$|E
500|$|Paul endorses {{constitutional}} rights, such as {{the right}} to keep and bear arms, and habeas corpus for political detainees. He opposes the Patriot Act, federal use of torture, presidential autonomy, a national identification card, warrantless domestic surveillance, and the draft. Paul also believes that the notion of {{the separation of church and}} state is currently misused by the court system: [...] "In case after case, the Supreme Court has used the infamous 'separation of church and state' metaphor to uphold court decisions that allow the federal government <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> upon and deprive citizens of their religious liberty." ...|$|E

5000|$|Territorial {{behavior}} is usually performed to defend {{resources such as}} food, shelter, possible mates, spawning sites, and offspring. Redlip blennies live among rocks and coral reefs, and they are benthic. [...] A redlip blenny generally exhibits aggressive territorial behaviors towards other benthic fishes, as they may take over its shelter and spawning site. Its territorial {{behavior is}} most severe towards conspecifics. This is because the conspecifics share exactly {{the same set of}} resources, leading to the most severe resource competition. A redlip blenny shows hostility of varying degrees not only <b>to</b> <b>intruding</b> conspecifics but also <b>to</b> barely <b>intruding</b> conspecifics. Due <b>to</b> this severe territoriality, the redlip blennies that have lost their territories experience a great difficulty in finding a new territory. Empty territories are often shared by neighboring fish without much competition. Despite severe territoriality, during the periods of lower adult blenny density, many blennies gather up and fight against old residents to take over their territories. After such aggressive competition, each old resident usually ends up with only half of its previous territory.|$|R
500|$|In the {{preamble}} of this act [...] religious freedom is defined; {{and after a}} recital 'that to suffer the civil magistrate <b>to</b> <b>intrude</b> his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty', it is declared 'that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere [...] when [...] principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order.' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs {{to the church and}} what to the State.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of strikes during Rolling Thunder were launched from four air bases, in Thailand: Korat, Takhli, Udon Thani, and Ubon. The aircraft refueled from aerial tankers over Laos before flying {{on to their}} targets in the DRV. After attacking their targets (usually by dive-bombing) the strike forces would either fly directly back to Thailand or exit over the relatively safe waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. It was quickly decided that, in order to limit airspace conflicts between air force and naval strike forces, North Vietnam was divided into six target regions called [...] "route packages", each of which was assigned to either the air force or navy and into which the other was forbidden <b>to</b> <b>intrude.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dance forms {{appealed to}} Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, {{but also the}} minuet, forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, habanera and passacaglia. National and {{regional}} consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic, Greek, Hungarian and gypsy themes. He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin, Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn, interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style. Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that [...] "true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion", with the corollary that {{a piece of music}} should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed <b>to</b> <b>intrude.</b>|$|E
