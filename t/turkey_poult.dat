40|$|THE {{riboflavin}} {{requirements of}} the chick {{and the consequences of}} ribo-flavin deficiency have been fairly well established by Lepkovsky and Jukes (1936). Jukes (1938) found that the riboflavin requirements of chicks and turkey poults for maximum growth were about the same. Later work has sub-stantially confirmed this observation, the requirements of chicks being about 250 micrograms of riboflavin per 100 grams of feed (Bethke and Record, 1942) and that of the <b>turkey</b> <b>poult</b> 270 (Patrick et al. 1944). The consequences of riboflavin defi-ciency in the <b>turkey</b> <b>poult</b> are not as well established as in the chicken.

40|$|Rye {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), leading to reduced digestibility. Since poultry {{have little or no}} endogenous enzymes capable of hydrolyzing these NSP, exogenous carbohydrases as feed additives are used in an attempt to reduce the anti-nutritional effects of these polysaccharides. Previously, an in vitro study conducted in our laboratory showed that inclusion of certain Bacillus direct-fed microbial (DFM) candidates that produce exogenous phytase, lipase, protease, cellulase and xylanase in high NSP diets significantly reduced both digesta viscosity and Clostridium perfringens proliferation. In the present study, rye-based turkey starter diets with or without Bacillus-DFM were administered ad libitum to day-of-hatch <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> in two independent experiments. In both experiments, day-of-hatch <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly assigned to either a control diet (CON) or a DFM treated diet (n = 25 birds/group). At ten days–of-age, all <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> from experiments 1 and 2 were weighted and 12 turkey poults/group were randomly selected and humanely killed.

Histological analyses of astrovirus pathogenesis demonstrate clinical disease is not associated with changes to intestinal architecture, inflammation, or cell death.

The current study used the type- 2 turkey astrovirus (TAstV- 2) and <b>turkey</b> <b>poult</b> model of astrovirus disease to examine how astrovirus infection affects the ultrastructure and electrophysiology of the intestinal epithelium. These data demonstrate that infection results in changes to the epithelial ultrastructure, rearrangement of F-actin, decreased absorption of sodium, as well as redistribution of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE 3) from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data suggest astrovirus infection induces sodium malabsorption, possibly through redistribution of specific sodium transporters, which results in the development of an osmotic diarrhea...|$|E

The hypothesis proposed by {{the current study was}} that weak poults identified by their characteristic flip-over behavior would differ physiologically from normal poults in a way that interferes with development of critical systems such as the cardiovascular and nervous system. Eight groups of 500 poults (from a 20 -wk laying cycle) of the same breeder flock were examined. Each placement was in the same brooder house operated at identical conditions. Observations of `flip-over` poults were made at 6 -h intervals for the initial wk of age. Identified poults (n = 12) were sacrificed and sampled immediately. Flip-over poults differed from controls only in depressed heart weight and plasma thyroid hormone concentrations. The identified poults did not differ from controls in body weight, liver weight, yolk weight, blood glucose or organ glycogen concentrations. In a second trial, reduced heart weights were noted along with reduced capability to maintain cardiac glycogen concentrations.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 In recent years, small poultry {{producers}} {{have been interested}} in finding an alternative for corn and soybean for a variety of reasons. Health concerns related to either naturally occurring isoflavones (phytoestrogens) or their genetically modified organism (GMO) status are the primary considerations behind this trend. Secondly, the recent high prices of corn and soy and unavailability of these two ingredients locally are other reasons to identify alternative feed ingredients. For these reasons, three experiments were performed to identify the feasibility of including locally grown alternative feed ingredients in turkey rations. The first experiment assessed the inclusion of up to 30 % wheat, 10 % lentils, and 10 % chickpea to replace all of the corn and a part of soybean in turkey diets to eight weeks of age. The wheat based diet was supplemented with Alpha Gal™ 180 P enzymes at level 0. 4 1 bs/ton. Day old <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the diets and body weight, feed consumption, and mortality were recorded at two, four, six and, eight weeks of age. Body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed wheat based diets with and without enzymes outperformed (p = 0. 04) the body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed the corn-soy based control diet. No significant (p > 0. 05) differences were observed between the body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed diets with or without enzymes. There was no significant difference between the feed conversion ratios of the three groups. Feeding wheat-based diets improved growth rates in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> compared with corn-soy based control diet but did not affect feed conversion. Adding AlphaGal™ 180 p to wheat-based diets did not improve growth rates or feed conversion in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults.</b> Experiment two compared the growth rates and feed conversions of turkeys fed a corn based –soy free, and, a wheat based (corn-soy free) to the control (corn-soy based) diets. Day old <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly assigned to one of the diets. Body weight, feed consumption, and mortality were determined at two, four, six and, eight weeks of age. The final body weights of poults fed the control diet were significantly higher than those fed a corn based-soy free or a wheat based (corn-soy free) diets (P = 0. 001). There were no statistical differences between body weights (3. 1 kg) of birds fed a corn based-soy free diet and body weights (3. 2 kg) of birds fed a wheat based (corn-soy free) diet. The feed efficiency was not different between treatments. Excluding soybean from the diets decreased growth rates in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> but did not affect feed conversion. It also increased mortality and cannibalism. Experiment three compared the growth rates and feed efficiency of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed wheat based diets containing different level of methionine (control 0. 5 %, organic 0. 15 %, and, no supplemental methionine 0 %) for six weeks. There were no significant differences between the mean body weights of birds fed a wheat based diet supplemented with 0. 5 % methionine (control) and the mean body weights of birds fed a wheat based diet supplemented with 0. 15 % methionine (organic), while <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed a ration containing 0 % supplemental methionine had significantly (P <. 05) lower bodyweight when compared to the organic (0. 15 % met) and control (0. 5 % met) diets.

After only 4 hr of storage ionized calcium levels were significantly depressed in serum. Significant changes were noted in both plasma and serum ionized calcium when stored frozen or unfrozen for 24 hr. Several anticoagulants were tested for interference with plasma free calcium.

40|$|CHOLINE is {{important}} in nutrition because of the roles that it plays in liver fat metabolism (Best and Hunts-man, 1932) and in transmethylation reactions occurring in the body (du Vigneaud et al., 1939). A deficiency of choline in the diet of the chick or the <b>turkey</b> <b>poult</b> causes perosis (Jukes, 1940, 1941). Eggs {{are considered to be}} one of the richest sources of choline, which occurs almost entirely in the yolk. Nott-bohm and Mayer as quoted by Grossfeld (1938) analyzed six egg yolks which con-tained 9. 58 - 11. 60 mg. of choline per gm. Engel (1943) found 17. 13 mg. choline per gm. of fresh egg yolk, or, assuming an average yolk weight of 18 gm., one egg would contain 306 mg. of choline. Ring-rose and Davis (1946) analyzed eggs from hens on diets containing different levels of choline and obtained values from 10. 4 to 15. 3 mg. per gm. of egg yolk (187 to 276 mg. per egg assuming a yolk weight of 18 gm.). Eggs undergo a number of readily ob-served changes during cold storage, but little is known of the chemical changes taking place. Evans, Davidson and Butts (1949 a) have reported apparent losses of total protein during storage of shell eggs and these losses were accompanied by some change in the amino acid composi-* Published with the approval of the Director of the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station as Journal Article No. 1162. tion of the proteins (Evans et al., 1949 b, c). Sharpe (1924) observed a decrease in choline content of incubated eggs, but no data have been published on the choline content of cold storage eggs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{consumption}} of new wood shavings on hematology of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> was {{studied in the}} response of groups fed commercial turkey starter rations with added folic acid, with wood shavings {ad libitum), with both or neither. There were no significant dif-ferences in the hematological parameters of mean cell volume, erythrocyte numbers, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration or mean cell hemoglobin concentration indicating that the consumption of new shavings {{was not related to}} a folic acid deficiency severe enough to cause the classical macrocytic anemia. The consumption of wood shavings used for litter for <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> may be high under certain environmental or man-agement conditions. Previous experiments (Charles, 1972) have suggested that feather and leg problems of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> might be related to the consumption of old litter. Positive responses in growth rate, as well as bone and feather development were obtained with high levels of folic acid (80 mg. /kg.). Since this level of dietary folic acid reduced the consump-tion of old litter an experiment was de-signed to study the effect of the consump-tion of new wood shavings on <b>turkey</b> <b>poults.</b> One of the characteristic symp-toms of folic acid deficiency is a macro-cytic, hypochromic anemia (Wintrobe, 1962). If the consumption of shavings resulted in a classical folic acid deficiency this should be evidenced by a macrocytic, hypochromic anemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS The experimental design consisted of four dietary treatments each replicated three times with eight poults started i...|$|R
40|$|Different {{in vitro}} and in silico {{approaches}} from our research group {{have demonstrated that}} neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) {{can be used to}} detoxify aflatoxins. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of NEW to detoxify B-aflatoxins (AFB 1 and AFB 2) in contaminated maize and to confirm detoxification in an in vivo experimental model. Batches of aflatoxin-contaminated maize were detoxified with NEW and mixed in commercial feed. A total of 240 6 -day-old female large white Nicholas- 700 <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly divided into four treatments of six replicates each (10 turkeys per replicate), which were fed ad libitum for two weeks with the following dietary treatments: (1) control feed containing aflatoxin-free maize (CONTROL); (2) feed containing the aflatoxin-contaminated maize (AF); (3) feed containing the aflatoxin-contaminated maize detoxified with NEW (AF + NEW); and (4) control feed containing aflatoxin-free maize treated with NEW (NEW). Compared to the control groups, <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> of the AF group significantly reduced body weight gain and increased feed conversion ratio and mortality rate; whereas <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> of the AF + NEW group did not present significant differences on productive parameters. In addition, alterations in serum biochemical constituents, enzyme activities, relative organ weight, gross morphological changes and histopathological studies were significantly mitigated by the aflatoxin-detoxification procedure. From these results, it is concluded that the treatment of aflatoxin-contaminated maize with NEW provided reasonable protection against the effects caused by aflatoxins in young <b>turkey</b> <b>poults...</b>|$|R
40|$|AMARKED growth {{promoting}} effect of a fermentation supplement, now known to contain aureomycin, for <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> was reported by McGinnis et al. (1949). This growth response was ob-tained under conditions where materials containing vitamin Bi 2 failed to give a stimulus. Stokstad et al. (1949) also reported that a fermentation supplement produced by Streptomyces aureofaciens promoted better chick growth than that obtained with vitamin Bi 2. More recently Stokstad and Jukes (1950) showed that a highly purified preparation of aureomycin promoted growth of chicks and <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> comparable to that obtained with a dried aureomycin fermentation mash. Luecke et al. (1950) found that strep-tomycin was effective in promoting growth of pigs. A similar effect of aureo-mycin on growth of pigs was observed by Jukes et al. (1950). Morehouse (1949) reported that 3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxybenzene arsonic acid stimulated growth of turkeys fed a practical type of diet. A series of experiments were conducted at this laboratory to determine the com-parative effect of different antibiotics on growth of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults.</b> The results are reported in this paper...|$|R
