40|$|We {{model the}} growth of Ag films {{deposited}} on Ag(100) below 140 K. Our recent Variable-Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (VTSTM) studies reveal “smooth growth” from 120 - 140 K, consistent with earlier diffraction studies. However, we also find rougher growth for lower temperatures. This unexpected behavior is modeled by describing the deposition dynamics using a “restricted downward funneling” model, wherein deposited atoms get caught {{on the sides of}} steep nanoprotrusions (which are prevalent below 120 K), rather than always funneling down to lower four-fold hollow adsorption sites. At OK, where no <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes</b> are operative, this leads to the formation of overhangs and internal defects (or voids). Above 40 K, low barrier interlayer <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes</b> become operative, producing the observed smooth growth by 120 K.

40|$|The {{importance}} and mechanisms of transient mobility of atoms and molecules adsorbing at surfaces {{have been a}} subject of controversy for many years. We used classical molecular dynamics simulations to examine transient mobility of Pd atoms adsorbing on the MgO (100) surface with incident kinetic energies not exceeding 0. 4 eV. The calculations show that deposited Pd atoms exhibit high mobility at temperatures below 80 K where the contribution from <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes</b> should be negligible. For our selected deposition conditions, aimed at simulation of Pd cluster growth experiments, an estimated 76 of the impinging Pd atoms are expected to travel up to 20 Ã away from the collision site before capture on a 5 K surface. We find that mobility of metal atoms on oxide surfaces is expected to decrease with decreasing incident energy and increase with decreasing incident angle. Comparison with prior studies highlights similarities and differences with other surface <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes,</b> such as long jumps. At higher surface temperatures, the observed mobility will mainly be due to thermally activated processes rather than transient mobility mechanisms. Atoms that exhibit transient mobility upon deposition may quickly migrate to surface features and defects affecting kinetics of growth and structures of nanoclusters and surface layers.

40|$|The aim {{to provide}} {{preventive}} healthcare and high quality medical diagnostics and treatment to an increasingly ageing population caused a rapidly increasing demand for point-of-care diagnostic devices. Disposables {{have an advantage}} over re-usable units as cross-contamination is avoided, no cleaning and sterilising of equipment is required and devices can be used out of centralised laboratories. To remain cost-effective, costs for disposables should be kept low. This makes polymer materials an obvious choice. One method for the realisation of fluidic micro devices is the stacking of several layers of microstructured polymer films. Reel-to-reel manufacturing is a promising technique for high-volume manufacturing of disposable polymer bio-analytical devices. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and cycloolefin copolymer (COC) were selected as suitable polymer substrate materials and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) as membrane layer.

40|$|In most {{conventional}} sources, including nuclear, {{chemical and}} photovoltaic, the energy manifests initially {{in the form}} of extremely energetic “hot particles”, and then rapidly disperses into the surrounding bulk medium as heat. In chemical and photovoltaic scenarios, energy gets released or absorbed, respectively, in units of around 1 - 5 eV, less a work function of at most about 1 eV. Given that 1 eV ≈ 1. 16 × 104 K, the nascent chemical reaction products and photoelectrons thus have temperatures of the order of 10, 000 - 50, 000 K. The daughter nucleii in U 235 decay carry 55 - 100 MeV [1], which correspond to 1012 K. The Carnot efficiency for direct conversion of chemical hot particle energies would be 97 - 99 %, and virtually indistinguishable from unity for nascent nuclear fission products. The hot particles are so called because they are indeed this hot against the backdrop of bulk medium temperature, and therefore represent an extremely low entropy energy source.

40|$|The {{migration}} of low-mass planets {{is driven by}} the differential Lindblad torque and the corotation torque in non-magnetic viscous models of protoplanetary discs. The corotation torque has recently received detailed attention as it may slow down, stall, or reverse migration. In laminar viscous disc models, the long-term evolution of the corotation torque is intimately related to viscous and <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes</b> in the planet's horseshoe region. This paper examines the properties of the corotation torque in discs where MHD turbulence develops {{as a result of the}} magnetorotational instability, considering a weak initial toroidal magnetic field. We present results of 3 D MHD simulations carried out with two different codes. Non-ideal MHD effects and the disc's vertical stratification are neglected, and locally isothermal disc models are considered. The running time-averaged torque exerted by the disc on a fixed planet is evaluated in three disc models. We first present results with an inner disc cavity (planet trap). As in viscous disc models, the planet is found to experience a positive running time-averaged torque over several hundred orbits, which highlights the existence of an unsaturated corotation torque maintained in the long term in MHD turbulent discs. Two disc models with initial power-law density and temperature profiles are also adopted, in which the time-averaged torque is found to be in decent agreement with its counterpart in laminar viscous disc models with similar viscosity at the planet location. Detailed analysis of the averaged torque density distributions indicates that the differential Lindblad torque takes very similar values in MHD turbulent and laminar viscous discs, and there exists an unsaturated corotation torque in MHD turbulent discs. This analysis also reveals the existence of an additional corotation torque in weakly magnetized discs. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
