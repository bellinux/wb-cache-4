25|$|Van Jacobson is an American {{computer}} scientist, {{best known}} for his work on TCP/IP network performance and scaling. His work redesigning TCP/IP's flow control algorithms (Jacobson's algorithm) to better handle congestion is said to have saved the Internet from collapsing in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is also known for the TCP/IP Header Compression protocol described in RFC 1144: Compressing TCP/IP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links, popularly known as Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression. He is co-author of several widely used network diagnostic tools, including <b>traceroute,</b> tcpdump, and pathchar. He was a leader {{in the development of the}} multicast backbone (MBone) and the multimedia tools vic, vat, and wb.|$|E

40|$|In {{the never-ending}} quest for tools that enable an ISP to smooth {{troubleshooting}} and improve awareness of network behavior, very much {{effort has been}} devoted {{in the collection of}} data by active and passive measurement at the data plane and at the control plane level. Exploitation of collected data has been mostly focused on anomaly detection and on root-cause analysis. Our objective is somewhat in the middle. We consider <b>traceroutes</b> collected by a network of probes and aim at introducing a practically applicable methodology to quickly spot measurements that are related to high-impact events happened in the network. Such filtering process eases further in- depth human-based analysis, for example with visual tools which are effective only when handling a limited amount of data. We introduce the empathy relation between <b>traceroutes</b> as the cornerstone of our formal characterization of the <b>traceroutes</b> related to a network event. Based on this model, we describe an algorithm that finds <b>traceroutes</b> related to high-impact events in an arbitrary set of measurements. Evidence of the effectiveness of our approach is given by experimental results produced on real-world data.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} inferring the underlay topology among a {{group of}} hosts by traceroute-like end-to-end measurement tools. Since pair-wise <b>traceroutes</b> among hosts take a long time and generate much network traffic, Max-Delta has been proposed to infer a highly accurate topology with a low number of <b>traceroutes.</b> However, there is still high measurement redundancy in Max-Delta. That is, a router may be repeatedly visited in different <b>traceroutes.</b> In this paper, we integrate a previously proposed Doubletree algorithm into Max-Delta to reduce such redundancy. We study two key issues in the integration, i. e., the selection of h (a parameter of Doubletree) and the distribution of the global stop set of Doubletree. We have conducted extensive simulations on Internet-like topologies to evaluate the proposed scheme. The results show that Doubletree can significantly reduce the measurement redundancy and the bandwidth consumption in Max-Delta while introducing a small penalty in the measurement accuracy. I...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenging}} problems related with network topology discovery in Internet {{is the process}} of IP address alias identification. Topology information is usually obtained from a set of <b>traceroutes</b> that provide IP addresses of routers in the path from a source to a destination. If these <b>traceroutes</b> are repeated between several source/destination pairs we can get a sampling of all IP addresses for crossed routers. In order to generate the topology graph in which each router is a node, it is needed to identify all IP addresses that belong to the same router. In this work we propose improvements over existing methods to obtain alias identification related mainly with the types and options in probing packets. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Traceroute</b> {{limitations}} {{are well known}} and {{should be taken into}} account when using the tool. For example, <b>traceroute</b> does not discover paths at the router level, but at the interface level. Another limitation appears when routers do not respond to probes or when routers have a limit for ICMP responses. In the presence of traffic load balancing, <b>traceroute</b> may indicate a path that does not actually exist, to minimize this problem there is a <b>traceroute</b> modification called Paris-traceroute, which maintains the flow identifier of the probes to avoid load balancing.|$|E
50|$|On Unix-like {{operating}} systems, <b>traceroute</b> sends, by default, {{a sequence}} of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, with destination port numbers ranging from 33434 to 33534; the implementations of <b>traceroute</b> shipped with Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and macOS include an option to use ICMP Echo Request packets (-I), or any arbitrary protocol (-P) such as UDP, TCP using TCP SYN packets, or ICMP.

40|$|The {{topology}} of the Internet has typically {{been measured}} by sampling <b>traceroutes,</b> which are roughly shortest paths from sources to destinations. The resulting measurements {{have been used}} to infer that the Internet's degree distribution is scale-free; however, many of these measurements have relied on sampling <b>traceroutes</b> from a small number of sources. It was recently argued that sampling in this way can introduce a fundamental bias in the degree distribution, for instance, causing random (Erdos-Renyi) graphs to appear to have power law degree distributions. We explain this phenomenon analytically using differential equations to model the growth of a breadth-first tree in a random graph G(n,p=c/n) of average degree c, and show that sampling from a single source gives an apparent power law degree distribution P(k) ~ 1 /k for k < c...|$|R

We carefully validate some aspects of these topologies using publicly available information. Our analyses uncover several interesting common features of these topologies. We find high variability both in the degree distribution of individual AS. s and in the size of AS points-of-presence. These AS. s seem to be engineered to match small-world properties: good overall path lengths with significant local clustering. There is an interesting locality in the geographic extent of AS. s; there exists a small number of metropolitan areas in which all AS. s have points of presence. Finally, the density of city-level connectivity of these AS. s suggests some differences in the way these AS. s are engineered...|$|R

40|$|Several {{models have}} been {{recently}} proposed for predicting the latency of end to end Internet paths. These models treat the Internet as a black-box, ignoring its internal structure. While these models are simple, they can often fail systematically; for example, {{the most widely used}} models use metric embeddings that predict no benefit to detour routes even though half of all Internet routes can benefit from detours. In this paper, we adopt a structural approach that predicts path latency based on measurements of the Internet’s routing topology, PoP connectivity, and routing policy. We find that our approach outperforms Vivaldi, the most widely used black-box model. Furthermore, unlike metric embeddings, our approach successfully predicts 65 % of detour routes in the Internet. The number of measurements used in our approach is comparable with that required by black box techniques, but using <b>traceroutes</b> instead of pings...|$|R
40|$|Multi-homed and overlay {{networks}} are two widely stud-ied approaches aimed at leveraging the inherent redun-dancy of the Internet’s underlying routing infrastructure to enhance end-to-end application performance and availabil-ity.

This paper quantitatively analyzes the impact of path diversity on multi-homed and overlay networks and highlights sev-eral inherent limitations of these architectures in exploit-ing the full potential redundancy of the Internet. We based our analysis on <b>traceroutes</b> and routing table data collected from several vantage points in the Internet including: look-ing glasses at ten major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), RouteViews servers from twenty ISPs, and more than fifty PlanetLab nodes globally distributed across the Internet.
