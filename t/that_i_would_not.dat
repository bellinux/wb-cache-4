5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli toured Belgium and the Rhine Valley {{with his}} father {{in the summer of}} 1824; he later wrote that it was while {{travelling}} on the Rhine that he decided to abandon his position: [...] "I determined when descending those magical waters <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a lawyer." [...] On their return to England he left the solicitors, at the suggestion of Maples, with the aim of qualifying as a barrister. He enrolled as a student at Lincoln's Inn and joined the chambers of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevy, and then those of Benjamin Austen, who persuaded Isaac that Disraeli would never make a barrister and should be allowed to pursue a literary career. He had made a tentative start: in May 1824 he submitted a manuscript to his father's friend, the publisher John Murray, but withdrew it before Murray could decide whether to publish it. Released from the law, Disraeli did some work for Murray, but turned most of his attention not to literature but to speculative dealing on the stock exchange.|$|E
500|$|To aid the {{transition}} to multiracial democracy, the South African government established a Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation in October 1991 to investigate human rights abuses committed by the country's various political factions. Its members were chosen by consensus among the three main parties. Goldstone had by now become reputed as an impartial and unimpeachable judge, and was asked by ANC chairman Nelson Mandela to head the commission; it {{became known as the}} Goldstone Commission. Goldstone explained later that he had been selected because he had earned the confidence of both sides: [...] "The government was aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> make findings against it without good cause, and the majority of South Africans had confidence that I would quote hesitate to make findings against the government if the evidence justified it." [...] He nonetheless received numerous death threats. He continued to work as an appeals court judge throughout his time chairing the Commission, hearing cases during the mornings and afternoons and then continuing through to midnight on Commission business.|$|E
500|$|Bevin said he [...] "strongly disagreed" [...] {{with the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, continuing [...] "When {{the definition of}} marriage {{was put on the}} ballot 10 years ago, 74 percent of Kentuckians {{made it clear that they}} supported traditional marriage. Since that time, however, activist judges have chosen to ignore the will of the people, and to ignore the Constitutional principle of state's rights." [...] He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: [...] "Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend our laws in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor." [...] Conway responded that he [...] "used the discretion given to me by statute to inform Gov. Beshear and the citizens of the Commonwealth <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> waste the scarce resources of this office pursuing a costly appeal that would not be successful." [...] Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place.|$|E

500|$|Frick and Gary {{traveled}} overnight {{by train}} to the White House to implore Roosevelt {{to set aside}} {{the application of the}} Sherman Antitrust Act and allow—before the market opened—a company that already held a 60% share of the steel market to make a large acquisition. Roosevelt's secretary refused to see them, but Frick and Gary convinced James Rudolph Garfield, the Secretary of the Interior, to bypass the secretary and arrange a meeting with the president. With less than an hour before the Stock Exchange opened, Roosevelt and Secretary of State Elihu Root began to review the proposed takeover and appreciate the crash likely to ensue if the merger was not approved. Roosevelt relented; he later recalled of the meeting, [...] "It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital. I do not believe that anyone could justly criticize me for saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> feel like objecting to the purchase under those circumstances". When news reached New York, confidence soared. The Commercial & Financial Chronicle reported that [...] "the relief furnished by this transaction was instant and far-reaching". The final crisis of the panic had been averted.|$|E
500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work {{at four in the morning}} and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eat myself sick". She could see [...] "no hope of saving anything in case of illness", but rather could see [...] "the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance". When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and [...] "the hour of freedom struck" ...|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you to believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

500|$|Besides {{working on}} the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote {{numerous}} essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: [...] "I {{was at a loss}} how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it." [...] These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask [...] "that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others." [...] The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, [...] "you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule." [...] (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as [...] "the greatest Genius in the present Age." ...|$|E
500|$|Suggestions for {{introducing}} a [...] "dark horse" [...] candidate {{began to take}} place. Members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination, but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting. Backers for Sherman and Blaine met after the convention was adjourned. Chandler laid down his terms. Blaine had nearly 300 votes, and could not simply withdraw. As Chandler explained, even [...] "f Mr. Blaine permits his column to be broken, [...] Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, California, Oregon & twelve votes in the Territories will go to Grant... Mr. Blaine's Southern votes." [...] Both sides argued until two or three in the morning, but no decision had been reached. Grant leaders had also met that night in Roscoe Conkling's suite in the Grand Pacific Hotel. They discussed the imposing dangers of Grant's nomination bid, such as the third-term resistors. Many speculated that Grant {{was not going to}} receive the nomination. The Grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates, and found them both to be unacceptable. Some of the men called for Conkling himself as a substitute for Grant. They argued that with Grant out of the race, Conkling would face little resistance for the Republican nomination. However, Conkling refused to accept the idea of being nominated for president. He said [...] " [...] if I were to receive every other vote in the Convention, my own would still be lacking, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> give. I am here as the agent of New York to support General Grant to the end. Any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected, and could not be elected.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1896, the English {{translation}} of Der Judenstaat appeared in London as The Jewish State. Herzl had earlier confessed {{to his friend}} Max Bodenheimer that he [...] "wrote what I had to say without knowing my predecessors, {{and it can be}} assumed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have written it [...] had I been familiar with the literature".|$|E
5000|$|In April 1873, {{he visited}} Victor Hugo in Guernsey. He confessed his republican {{convictions}} {{to the great}} French poet, but added : [...] "If <b>I</b> said <b>that</b> aloud, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be reelected".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa {{has taken}} all be could of Edmund's,' said Gilbert, 'but he could <b>not</b> take <b>that!</b> No, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{have any other}} room {{if you were to}} give me the best in the house.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Moore {{said that}} Thompson, [...] "fearing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> obey his order, decided to {{threaten}} other state officials and {{force them to}} remove the monument if I did not do so. A threat of heavy fines {{was his way of}} coercing obedience to that order," [...] an action that Moore sees as a violation of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have never}} regretted what I said in 'the last press conference.' I {{believe that it}} gave the media a warning <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> sit back and take {{whatever}} biased coverage was dished out to me. I think the episode was partially responsible for the much fairer treatment I received from the press {{during the next few}} years. From that point of view alone, it was worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Mo'Nique, {{the winner}} of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the {{ceremony}} in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel [...] "for enduring all that she had to so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have to". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s.|$|E

[...] "If {{he were the}} devil folk think him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> fear him; but though there is something queer about him, he's no more a devil than you are, and <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> tell to every one." ...|$|R

2500|$|Cornwall's {{entry into}} {{political}} life was aided by his connection with his cousin, Charles Jenkinson, an association {{to be much}} strengthened when he married Jenkinson's sister Elizabeth on 17 August 1764. In 1763 {{he wrote to his}} future brother-in-law: [...] "A seat in Parliament is my first object, without <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> choose to engage in any department of public business." [...] However, he was persuaded instead to become a Commissioner for examining the German Accounts. Occupying this post from 1763 to 1765, he gained a good knowledge of Treasury procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta, whose testimonies as a collaborating witness {{during the}} Maxi Trial had been {{instrumental}} to convict many Mafia bosses, {{refused to talk}} about the relationship between Cosa Nostra and politicians. He told Giovanni Falcone one of the prosecutors at the Maxi Trial: [...] "I have told you repeatedly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> discuss it until and if the time is ripe. It would be extremely foolish to discuss this subject - which is the crucial knot of the Mafia problem - while the very people whom we would be discussing remain fully active on the political scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{after the}} premiere of the {{international}} film Candy (1968), Cavett went to {{a party at the}} Americana Hotel, where those who had just seen the film were being interviewed for TV.. He later said [...] "When the interviewer, Pat Paulsen, got to me, he asked what I thought the critics would say about Candy. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, {{that they would have to}} reconvene the Nuremberg Trials to do it justice. He laughed and asked what I had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be forced to vomit indoors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{shall have to}} lie," [...] he said to himself. [...] "I hate <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> do it for myself, but the lie will hurt no one and may save Sidi. Anyhow I won't tell more than I can help." ...|$|R
60|$|Strange how one reaches an epoch-making {{moment in}} one's life without {{recognising}} it. If <b>I</b> had refused <b>that</b> invitation, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have--at any rate, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have missed a remarkable experience.
