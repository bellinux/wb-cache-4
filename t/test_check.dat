40|$|Abstract—The recent {{explosion}} of online networked {{data and the}} discovery of universal topological characteristics in real world networks {{has led to the}} emergence of a new domain of research, namely, social networks. However, much research in this domain remains unexplored due to the unavailability of sensitive networks, which include hate networks, trust net-works and sexual relationship networks. This paper proposes a secure multiparty protocol which allows a set of parties to compute the underlying network on them. The proposed protocol is information theoretic secure, and its security is further enhanced by a list of security tests, which include, k-anonymity <b>test,</b> <b>check</b> for self loops and weighted edges. Although some solutions have been proposed for this problem earlier, the practicality of each one of those is questionable. Index Terms—Multiparty computation, Social networks, Anonymizatio...|$|E

Peculiarities of skewness, kurtosis and rated maxima (quantiles) calculations based on the ensemble of the stochastic ergodic process realizations have been considered. Density and cumulative distribution function of the quadratic stochastic processes with normal distribution have been analyzed.

In the empirical model we also include other theoretically justified variables {{in the case of}} Pakistan, such as foreign remittances, money supply, and government spending. The paper implements the ADF method to <b>test</b> <b>check</b> the stationarity of the series; and the ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration to establish a long run relationship. The findings affirm cointegration among the series. Real devaluation exerts contractionary effect on economic growth. The results from variance decomposition and impulse response-function show unidirectional causality from foreign remittances to economic growth; and bidirectional causality between money supply and foreign remittances. Furthermore, money supply Granger causes government spending; while devaluation Granger causes economic growth, albeit, weakly. The results should help in formulating a comprehensive trade policy including the use of competitive devaluation as a tool to correct balance of payments problems. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} realm of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars from a {{theoretical}} viewpoint, by constructing synthetic population of transition objects, proto-Planetary Nebulae, Planetary Nebulae Nuclei, and post-Planetary Nebulae objects. We use the Montecarlo procedure to filter out the populations accordingly to a given set of assumptions. We explore the parameter space by studying {{the effects of the}} Initial Mass Function (IMF), the Initial Mass-Final Mass Relation (IMFMR), the transition time (t_tr), the envelope mass {{at the end of the}} envelope ejection (Me_r), the planetary nebula lifetime t_PN, the hydrogen- and helium-burning phases of the central stars. The results are discussed on the basis of the HR diagram distributions, on the Mv-t plane, and with mass histograms. We found that: (1) the dependence of the synthetic populations on the assumed IMF and IMFMR is generally mild; (2) the Me_r indetermination produces very high indeterminations on the t_tr and thus on the resulting post-AGB populations; (3) the synthetic models give a <b>test</b> <b>check</b> for the ratio of He- to H-burning PNNi.

40|$|The {{question}} is whether these pragmatic problems evidently differ from the problems that children with a normal development encounter. Further, {{is it possible to}} account for such a pragmatic group distinction on the basis of other competences like structural language problems? In this framework, data were collected with 29 SLI-children and 33 control- children (aged 4 - 7), their parents and teachers, with the Nijmegen Test for Pragmatics (NPT), tests for receptive vocabulary and auditive memory, an IQ <b>test</b> (<b>check),</b> and parent/teacher judgments. The pragmatic skills of the SLI group were significantly lower than those of the control group. We also found a significant relation between the language proficiency tests and the pragmatics scores which indicated that pragmatic disorders are in line with structural language problems. Children with serious structural language problems obviously show more pragmatic problems. The below average pragmatic level of SLI-children is distressing, as it leads to less interaction and to obstruction of language proficiency development. If structural language problems occur together with language use problems, specific diagnosis and therapy are required. Pragmatic skills testing by clinicians, diagnoticians, and therapists, places the child’s structural language problem in a broader context, highlighting the trouble the child and its direct environment encounter in everyday communication...|$|E
40|$|Dead code is {{source code}} {{that is not}} {{necessary}} for the correct execution of an application. Dead code {{is a result of}} software ageing. It is a threat for maintainability and should therefore be removed. Many organizations in the web domain have the problem that their software grows and demands increasingly more effort to maintain, <b>test,</b> <b>check</b> out and deploy. Old features often remain in the software, because their dependencies are not obvious from the software documentation. Dead code can be found by collecting the set of code that is used and subtract this set from the set of all code. Collecting the set can be done statically or dynamically. Web applications are often written in dynamic languages. For dynamic languages dynamic analysis suits best. From the maintainability perspective a dynamic analysis is preferred over static analysis because it is able to detect reachable but unused code. %Via dynamic analysis all unused files are visualized in a tree map in which you can click the boxes to open them like you open directories in an ordinary file explorer. Also an Eclipse plug-in is developed to reduce the impact of existing dead code to the development process before removing it. In this thesis, we develop and evaluate techniques and tools to support software engineering with dead code identification and elimination for dynamic languages. The language used for evaluation is PHP, one of the most commonly used languages in web development. We demonstrate how and to which extent the techniques and tools proposed can support software developers at Hostnet, a Dutch web hosting organization.
