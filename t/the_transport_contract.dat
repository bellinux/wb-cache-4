40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>transport</b> buying companies and carriers, with a focus on <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contracts</b> in Sweden for land based <b>transports.</b> Based on <b>the</b> {{aim of this}} study, the following research questions have been defined: How can contracts be categorized? What is the average duration and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contracts</b> to external changes? and Which environmental related elements are commonly regulated in the contracts? Based on a literature review and interviews with people on strategic positions in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> industry, we have conducted a web-survey. In addition to contractual agreements the survey also tried to capture the relation on environmental issues, as well as the experienced logistics performance over time. Results from the survey indicates that the suggested contract categorisation from the literature was not well known by the respondents, the average duration of contracts was 1 - 2 years and the majority of contracts includes a fuel clause, but not many environmental requirements. Further, the analysis indicates that companies with long term contracts set environmental requirements to a larger extend and that there is a positive significant relation between the companies’ environmental work with in <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> operation and their perception of an improved logistics performance, both in terms of quality and cost.

40|$|The {{autonomy}} of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract</b> was developed over time having as basis few elements of legislation.

The essential element that distinguishes it from other contracts is that during the execution of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract</b> there are involved three persons, namely: the consignor, the carter and the consignee. The legal form and the {{autonomy of}} <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract</b> result from {{the fact that there is}} a real and a consensual contract, that has an economic content in different ways; the parties of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract</b> must understand that the general conditions on the ability to control the consent lawfully expressed, has a determined object, licit and moral feature and the form required by law.

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the rationale of article 1006 of the Colombian Commercial Code which prohibits the heirs of a passenger {{killed in an}} accident, during the execution of a transport contract, from cumulatively exercising the contractual action created by the carrier and the respective action for tort. The article examines {{the issue of the}} concurrence of the damage that the person who dies suffers and the damages which are inferred to the heirs by the deceased arising from the death of the person. From this review the author asserts that both damages must be repaid in their totality and in the same judicial process, and that the reasons that once explained the prohibition of accumulation of both actions, have disappeared as a result of accurate precedents in recent case law in this respect. Nevertheless, this affirmation is not valid in relation to <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract</b> because express law exists to opposite effect, indeed, the aforementioned article 1006. Therefore, modification of this article is recommended as the prohibition is not reasonable, since the arguments which allow the accumulation of actions for other events are equally applicable to <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a principal-agent {{model in which}} the regulator faces a moral hazard problem as he cannot observe the effort exerted by public transit operators.

The main result {{is that none of}} these contracts provides the appropriate incentives to public transit operators. Thus, we propose a fixed-quantity contract as an alternative financing mechanism. The fixed-quantity contract is a high-powered incentive contract that allows the regulator to perfectly forecast the amount of public funds to be used in <b>the</b> urban <b>transport</b> system. Moreover, <b>the</b> fixed-quantity contract can be adjusted to attain the equilibrium between incentives and optimal allocation of risk. ...|$|R
