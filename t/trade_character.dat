According to Law 26 / 1990, republished and modified “the traders are the natural persons and the family associations which realize usually trade acts, the commercial companies, national companies and enterprises, the autonomous administrations, the groups with economic interest and <b>trade</b> <b>character,</b> the groups of <b>trade</b> <b>character</b> and the cooperative organizations” (art. 1 paragraph 2). Corroborating the provisions of OUG 44 / 2008, respectively the art. 2 letter h), according to which “the family enterprise is the economic enterprise, without legal personality, organized by a natural person entrepreneur with his family” with art. 4, according to which the natural persons can develop economic activities individually and independently, as natural authorized persons, or as owner holders of an individual enterprise, or as members of a family enterprise, we conclude that in the actual regulation, which abrogates the Law 300 / 2004, the notion of family association is replaced with the one of family enterprise. The present study wants to analyze the modifications brought to OUG 44 / 2008 in the field, observing on one side the differences from the previous regulation concerning the family associations, and on the other side, the elements which particularize the family enterprises in comparison with PFA (natural authorized person) and with individual enterprises...|$|E
40|$|In a {{simplified}} {{version of the}} gravity model, appropriate dummy variables have been introduced to analyse the effects of both trade creation and trade diversion by three economic organizations, the European Economic Community (EEC), the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) and the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), for the period 1960 - 94. Five-year intervals are the main subject of measurement. The results show that both trade creation dummies and trade diversion dummies have statistically significant coefficients, which show the appropriateness of this new approach. The trade creation effect and trade diversion effect of each institution are proved to be generally weakening during the 1990 s. It is also observed that each Organization has a distinctive international <b>trade</b> <b>character.</b> For Japanese trade, a similar approach is used to analyse nonaligned trade by Japan, with particular interest in {{the effects of these}} three institutions on trade with Japan. The result {{is that there is no}} strong evidence that the EEC and the LAFTA trade with Japan any more or less than the hypothetical level predicted by basic explanatory variables, while the CMEA increased its trade with Japan up to the hypothetical level during the analysis period. ...|$|E

30|$|Except for MEI, a few {{solutions}} including micro gird (MG), virtual {{power plant}} (VPP) have been proposed to handle the energy supply issues. MG is a system consists {{of at least one}} clean energy generation unit and energy storage unit, mainly supplying personal power load demand in specific geographical areas [21]. MG connected to the PDN could operate in an isolated mode or a grid connection mode [21]. VPP is a system composed of several distributed generation units, can usually be regarded as a traditional power plant. VPP puts more emphasis on the comprehensive generation and <b>trading</b> <b>characters</b> of the whole virtual plant, and usually used in the electricity market [22]. MG and VPP only focus on the power supply without considering other energy forms such as thermal energy considered in CHP. CHP can supply thermal and power energy simultaneously, which could be viewed as a generation unit in MEI. Besides, MEI could accommodate the flow distribution of both power and other energy carriers. Undoubtedly, MG is the basis of the MEI, which puts more emphasis on the coordinated management and operation of multiple energy carriers.|$|R
40|$|How {{much does}} a nation spend on {{resources}} to 'grease {{the wheels of}} trade'? To examine this question the Dutch economy is used as an exemplary case as the Netherlands are known as a nation of traders. This image was derived {{in the seventeenth century}} from successes in long distance trade, shipping and financial innovations. Despite its historical background in trading the potential to 'truck and barter' has never been adequately measured. In this paper we present a first attempt in measuring and describing the Dutch transaction sector. Measurement by means of occupational data points out that approximately 25 percent of Dutch workers are employed in transaction jobs, and 29 percent if one includes transport and distribution tasks. From a historical perspective this may seem large, but we make the case that traditional sector categories underestimate the true <b>trading</b> <b>character</b> of an economy. Furthermore, we find that in enhancing transactions cities or agglomerations remain important, suggesting that face-to-face trade remains an important element of modern transactions. In contrast to the history of immigrants in the Netherlands, the main immigrant groups of today do not fulfill a brokerage function in bringing about trade between different cultures. transaction costs; trade; geography...|$|R
