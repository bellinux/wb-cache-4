25|$|On June 9, 2007, {{a tanker}} fire {{occurred}} on SR8 when a tanker truck with 10,000 gallons of fuel collided with another vehicle {{and started a}} fire. The fire caused SR8 to close {{for a couple of}} hours except for the westbound left lane, which crews used to get oil out of the soil underneath the highway. During the Winter 2007 storm, a slope that held up SR8 was eroded by floodwaters. The slope, located on SR8 west of the US101 interchange, and is scheduled <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> season and last 2 months. In 2010, WSDOT aims to rebuild the columns that support the SR8/US101 interchange and reduce the risk of failure in an earthquake, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{received}} the Professional Achievement Award from Westminster Choir College in 1984. In 1999 {{he received a}} Fulbright Fellowship grant for a lecture series at a college in Taiwan to teach organ repertoire and hymn improvisation, along with giving frequent organ recitals. Shortly before he was <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> series, the devastating 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake hit Taiwan on September 21 which measured 7.6 on the MMS scale. Walker's performances became benefit concerts, instead helping {{to raise money for}} disaster relief between October, 1999 and February, 2000. A recital by Walker, originally intended {{to be part of the}} 50th anniversary celebration of Taiwan's current government, was transformed into a memorial service for the earthquake's victims. His recital at National Concert Hall in Taipei in March, 2013 marked his 14th concert journey to Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|Many United Order {{communities}} {{were set up}} amongst Mormon towns beginning in 1874. One in particular was the United Order of Kanab, which was a communal experiment initiated by Brigham Young. Kanab was established in 1870. That year, John R. Young and the local bishop, Levi Stewart, began colonization of this area and twelve families followed <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> endeavor. However, there was confusion as to who {{was the leader of}} this society. LDS Church authorities appointed the bishop and only they could revoke his status. But many wanted to elect John R. Young as president because he was related to LDS Church president Brigham Young. This conflict of power lasted until January 5, 1875, when Levi Stewart became the president. Eventually, Stewart resigned from his position and L. John Nuttall of Provo took his place.|$|E
25|$|Another {{milestone}} privilege came in 1374 when Louis I of Hungary {{issued the}} Privilege of Koszyce, {{under which the}} king promised not to levy any taxes without agreement from the szlachta. From this, the nobles derived considerable leverage in their future dealings with the monarchy. Louis also promised to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad, and promised that the nobles {{would not have to}} aid in construction of castles unless they gave prior agreement for such a project <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> privilege also stated that the king had a duty to ensure that the country did not lose any territories, and regulated some issues related to the posting of officials. Finally, the king promised that the office of starosta would only be given to Poles, and that the offices of a given province (ziemia) would only be given to the local nobles.|$|E

The Airborne Division that was to lead the operation received no detailed plans until 2 February, {{less than a week}} before the campaign was <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> was of crucial importance, since many of the units, particularly the Airborne and the Marines, had worked as separate battalions and brigades and had no experience maneuvering or cooperating in adjoining areas.

On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. I know this is only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one deserves it more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E
500|$|A female {{acquaintance}} at Christ Church {{described the}} 19-year-old Heseltine as [...] "probably about 22, but {{he appears to}} be years older ... 6 feet high, absolutely fit ... brilliant blue eyes ... and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God". Although he enjoyed social success, he soon became depressed and unhappy with Oxford life. In April 1914 he spent part of his Easter vacation with Delius at Grez, and worked with the composer on the scores of An Arabesque and Fennimore and Gerda, in the latter case providing an English version of the libretto. He did not return to Oxford after the 1914 summer vacation; with his mother's reluctant consent he moved to Bloomsbury in London, and enrolled at University College London to study language, literature and philosophy. In his spare time he conducted a small amateur orchestra in Windsor, after admitting to Delius that he knew nothing of the art of conducting. However, his life as a student in London was brief; in February 1915, with the help of Lady Emerald Cunard (a mistress of Beecham) he secured a job as a music critic for the Daily Mail at a salary of £100 per year. He promptly abandoned his university studies <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> new career.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{producer}} Yoshinori Ono {{pitched the}} idea to Capcom R head Keiji Inafune, the prevailing attitude around Capcom was that a new numeric entry to the Street Fighter series would not be made. Initially, there was much resistance to Ono's pitch for a new Street Fighter game so many years after the original. The gap from 2000 to 2008, since Street Fighter EX3, the latest Street Fighter game at that point, represented the longest time the series had gone without a sequel. However, in light of fan demand plus the positive reception to Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting on Xbox Live Arcade, Inafune eventually allowed the project <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> <b>This</b> was Ono's first take on a new entry for the Street Fighter series as a producer, although he had previously worked on Street Fighter III 3rd Strike as a [...] "sound management director" [...] and previously produced Capcom Fighting Jam.

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the parents}} of Seattle University president Stephen Sundborg (and former 26-year residents of Alaska) George and Mary Sundborg donated $1million to the Seattle University School of Law Alaska Fund, a scholarship for Alaskan law students.

It was because of this commitment and in order <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> broader initiative that I asked my own parents for the initial gift to the Alaska Fund." [...] The elder Sundborg (one of the 55 signers of the Alaska State Constitution, a copy of which was displayed at Seattle University {{at the time of}} the donation) was an editor of newspapers in Juneau and Fairbanks, general manager of the Alaska Development Board and assistant to Governor and United States Senator Ernest Gruening.

[...] <b>To</b> <b>begin</b> <b>this</b> change, Sheares coined the motto [...] "Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian". Contextualizing the motto, Speller, herself black, informs that shame about being black has been [...] "part and parcel of the black experience in America", and that blacks have historically hid their shame behind a variety of coping strategies and behaviors. Martin E. Marty, an emeritus professor of religious history, further explains, [...] "For Trinity, being 'unashamedly black' does not mean being 'anti-white.' [...] Think of the concept of 'unashamedly': tucked into it is the word 'shame'." [...] Underlying the idea, according to Marty, is a diagnosis [...] "of 'shame', 'being shamed', and 'being ashamed' as debilitating legacies of slavery and segregation in society and church." [...] Marty also explains that the Afrocentrism contained in the statement [...] "should not be more offensive than that synagogues should be 'Judeo-centric' or that Chicago's Irish parishes be 'Celtic-centric'." [...] Speller informs that the motto [...] "has remained as a reminder of not only who [...] are but Whose they are, continuing to emphasize both meaning and belonging".|$|E
