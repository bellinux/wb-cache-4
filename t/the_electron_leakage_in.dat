40|$|PCB 126 is {{the most}} potent agonist of the aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) in the whole family of chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of persistent organic pollutants that are classified as probable human carcinogens. It exerts systematic toxicities in animals mainly through the AhR pathway and generates cellular oxidative stress which might damage cellular macromolecules. The goal of this thesis is to elucidate the mechanisms of PCB 126 toxicity in the aspect of AhR-related oxidative stress. Reactive superoxide radicals could be generated as <b>the</b> result of <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> catalytic cycles of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes which are super-induced by sustained AhR activation in response to PCB 126. In addition, the disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain caused by AhR ligands also contributes {{to the production of}} superoxide radicals. Correspondingly in this thesis, the impact of PCB 126 on the expression of the recently-discovered, TCDD-inducible microsomal CYP 2 S 1 enzyme was studied. Then the regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme MnSOD in response to PCB 126 was investigated. Lastly, a microarray study on classic AhR ligands of β-naphthoflavone and 3 -methylcholanthrene was conducted to explore possible mechanisms of AhR-associated toxicities and to find explanations for the regulation of CYP 2 S 1 as well as MnSOD after PCB 126 exposure. It was found that CYP 2 S 1 was only weakly or not at all regulated by PCB 126 in rats. As for MnSOD, although its messenger and protein levels were induced by PCB 126, its enzymatic activity was significantly reduced in the liver, probably through post-translational mechanisms. Although dietary manganese supplementation did not reverse the loss of MnSOD activity due to PCB 126 exposure, it significantly protected against liver hypertrophy caused by PCB 126. Microarray study results were consistent with previous findings and indicated that in addition to changed expression of a number of CYPs, metal homeostasis as well as mitochondria functions were also affected by AhR ligands. Overall, both CYP enzymes and the mitochondria contribute to the AhR-mediated toxicities of PCB 126 that are associated with a disturbance of cellular redox homeostasis...|$|R

Therefore, we show the measured EL spectra for LEDs A and B in a semi-log scale (see Fig.  3 c) to indicate the detailed information regarding the parasitic luminescence. The peak emission wavelength for the parasitic luminescence is centered at ~[*] 425  nm, which may arise from the deep levels associated with Mg dopants [26]. The intensity of the parasitic luminescence for LED B is stronger than that for LED A, and it is speculated that more carriers recombine at the deep levels. In our experiment, the p-type hole injection layers for both DUV LED architectures are not engineered, and the hole concentration level in the hole injection layers shall be similar. Therefore, it is identified that electrons that escape from the MQW region possess a higher concentration in the hole injection layer for LED B than those for LED A.

The polar c-plane LED (c-LED) {{suffers from a}} well-known efficiency droop, i.e., quantum efficiency reaching maximum at a very low current density and then gradual reduction under a higher injected current [3 – 13].

30|$|Ultraviolet beams in the {{wavelength}} regime of 200  nm~ 280  nm have found potential applications in water purification system [1, 2]. Considering the low DC driving voltage {{and the more}} compatibility with the water purification system, AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) are selected as the excellent candidate. It is worthy of mentioning that treating {{the water with a}} big volume requires the purification system to provide the high-power UVC light source. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for AlGaN-based DUV LEDs with the emission wavelength shorter than 280  nm is not satisfied at this moment [3]. The major limiting factor for the poor EQE partly arises from the large threading dislocation density (TDD) in the Al-rich quantum wells [2, 3]. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) quickly decreases once the TDD is in the order of 109  cm− 2 [3]. Even if the TDD is reduced to the order of 108  cm− 2 that can enable the IQE of 60 ~ 80 %, the effect of the efficiency droop may cause the EQE to be lower than 5 % for the bare UVC LEDs when the injection current density exceeds 80 A/cm 2 [4]. Note, the light extraction efficiency (LEE) for bare UVC LED chips is ~[*] 10 % according to FDTD calculations [5]. One of the leading interpretations for the efficiency droop of III-nitride-based LEDs is <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> spillover into <b>the</b> p-type hole injection layer [6]. The Al-rich AlGaN p-type hole injection layer possesses a free hole concentration even lower than 1 [*]×[*] 1017  cm− 3 [7], tending to cause a severer <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> level.

The spike layers possess the Al composition higher than the quantum barrier so the polarization induced electric field in the spike layers can well reduce the drift velocity of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> improved capture efficiency is therefore enabled only if the DUV LED is grown along the [0001] orientation. Another effective method to enhance <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> capture rate is to increase the conduction band offset between the quantum barrier and the quantum well, which can be realized by properly increasing the Al composition [10], while the quantum barrier architecture can be further evolved by having the Al composition graded [11]. As has been mentioned previously, the free hole concentration for the Al-rich p-type AlGaN hole injection layer is low which leads to the poor hole injection capability into the MQW region. The poor hole injection is also regarded as the cause of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> [12]. A promising method for increasing the hole thermionic emission across <b>the</b> p-type <b>electron</b> blocking layer (p-EBL) is to energize the holes by adopting the electric field reservoir [13]. The hole transport can also be favored if the p-AlGaN-based hole injection layer with the stair-cased Al composition is utilized for DUV LEDs [14]. The stair-cased Al composition can be further replaced by the graded Al composition for the AlGaN layer to enhance the hole concentration [15 – 17]. Besides engineering the hole injection layer, alternative p-EBLs have also been suggested to reduce the hole blocking effect, e.g., inserting a thin AlGaN layer with a lower Al composition [18]. A very important structure for the p-EBL candidate is the superlattice p-EBL. Tremendous research efforts have been made to explore the impact of the GaN/AlGaN superlattice for GaN-based blue LEDs [19 – 21]. Nevertheless, the AlGaN p-EBL for blue LEDs has the AlN composition lower than 20 %, making the hole blocking effect for blue LEDs not as severe as that for DUV LEDs. Therefore, the EQE improvement is smaller than 20 % and efficiency droop is still obvious even if the GaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL is adopted for blue LEDs. DUV LEDs employ Al-rich p-EBLs, giving rise to an even more challenging hole injection issue [1]. To solve the Al-rich p-EBL-caused hole blocking effect, superlattice p-EBL is also suggested for DUV LEDs, e.g., AlInGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [22] and AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL [23]. However, the experimental proof of the superlattice p-EBL that helps to obtain high and nearly efficiency-droop-free EQE lacks for DUV LEDs at this stage. Therefore, this work experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of a specifically designed AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice p-EBL in enhancing the EQE and significantly suppressing the efficiency droop for DUV LEDs. The enhanced EQE is well attributed to the improved hole injection into the MQW region while <b>the</b> reduced <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> level helps to remarkably suppress the efficiency droop. Detailed mechanism will be presented in this work subsequently.|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of preparations concerning the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE), studies were performed {{to better understand the}} effect of molten metal contact and electron beam impingement with various fabrics for space suit applications. The question arose as to what would occur if <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam from <b>the</b> Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool (UHT) designed for welding in space were to impinge upon a piece of Nextel AF- 62 ceramic cloth designed to withstand temperatures up to 1427 C. The expectation was that <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam would lay down a static charge pattern with no damage to the ceramic fabric. <b>The</b> <b>electron</b> beam is capable of spraying the fabric with enough negative charge to repel further <b>electrons</b> from <b>the</b> fabric before significant heating occurs. The static charge pattern would deflect any further charge accumulation except for a small initial amount of leakage to the grounded surface of the welder. However, when studies were made of the effect of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam on <b>the</b> insulating ceramic fabric it was surprisingly found that <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam did indeed burn through the ceramic fabric. It was also found that <b>the</b> shorter <b>electron</b> beam standoff distances had longer burnthrough times than did some greater electron beam standoff distances. A possible explanation for the longer burnthrough times for <b>the</b> small <b>electron</b> beam standoff distance would be outgassing of the fabric which caused <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam hand-tool to cycle on and off to provide some protection for <b>the</b> cathodes. <b>The</b> <b>electron</b> beam hand tool was observed to cycle off at the short standoff distance of two inches likely due to vapors being outgassed. During <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam welding process there is an <b>electron</b> <b>leakage,</b> or current leakage, flow from the fabric. A static charge pattern is initially laid down by <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam current flow. The static charge makes up the current leakage flow which initially slightly heats up the fabric. The initially laid down surface charge leaks a small amount of current. The rate at which the current charge leaks from the fabric controls how fast the fabric heats up. As the ceramic fabric is heated it begins to outgass primarily from contamination/impurities atoms or molecules on and below the fabric surface. The contaminant gases ionize to create extra charge carriers and multiply a current of <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> emitted gas which ionized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>leakage</b> flow promotes further leakage. Thus, the small leakage of charge from the fabric surface is enhanced by outgassing. When <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam current makes up the lost current, <b>the</b> incoming <b>electrons</b> heat <b>the</b> fabric and further enhance the outgassing. The additional leakage promotes additional heating up of the ceramic fabric. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> bound to <b>the</b> ceramic fabric surface leak off more and more as the surface gets hotter promoting even greater <b>leakage.</b> <b>The</b> additional <b>electrons</b> that result also gain energy in the field and produce further <b>electrons.</b> Eventually <b>the</b> process becomes unstable and accelerates to the point where a hole is burned through the fabric...|$|R

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes(LEDs) {{based on}} InGaN suffer from efficiency droop at current injection levels {{as low as}} 50  A[*]cm− 2. We investigated multiple quantum wellInGaNLEDs with varying InGaN barrier thicknesses (3 – 12 nm) emitting at ∼ 400 – 410  nm to investigate the effect of hole mass and also to find out possible solutions to prevent the efficiency droop. In LEDs with electron blocking layers, when we reduced the InGaN barriers from 12 to 3 nm, the current density for the peak or saturation of external quantum efficiency increased from 200 to 1100  A[*]cm− 2 under pulsed injection conditions, which eliminates the heating effects to a large extent. Our calculations show that such reduction in the barrier thickness makes the hole distribution more uniform among the wells.
