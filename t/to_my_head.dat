She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that [...] "You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent." [...] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described {{the application of the}} wig, saying [...] "they nailed it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> every morning." [...] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|Walters re-signed {{with the}} Eagles before {{training}} camp in 1983. He played in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions, but {{had to leave the}} game due to an injury. Three days later, on August 8, he announced his retirement from football, saying [...] "After 12 years of playing in the NFL, I earned the right to go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> coach and just say I've fought my battle. It's over." [...] However, when his replacement, Dean Miraldi, suffered a sprained knee in the next preseason game, Walters ended his week-long retirement to re-join the Eagles on August 15. The contract offered to him included a clause that the organization would put up a barn next to his house. He re-injured his knee against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 25 and had to leave the game. Before the November 20 game against the New York Giants, Walters was benched, along with four other starters, by head coach Marion Campbell in an attempt to rejuvenate the team with younger players after five straight losses. He finished the season with ten starts in twelve games. He ended a streak of 122 consecutive starts at left tackle for the Eagles during the 1983 season.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{gave him}} 48 hours {{to decide whether}} he wanted to join the new band that would [...] "rival the Pistols". Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed. Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E

In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and when I pointed it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> she opened the door.

May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W.

2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes. Nina expressed that the album's direction to a new sound reflects to her new improved self, saying [...] "I have changed a lot. From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It's confidence in my singing and performing and letting people know that I'm a singer." [...] She stated that the album will be a studio album with two covers, and that its sound is going to be [...] "sexy-soul," [...] which she defined as [...] "singing from the soul but having a degree of sexiness to it." [...] Stay Alive is heavily considered as Nina's comeback in the recording scene, being described as a mixture of pop, club and R songs which is very different from her previous sound. She admitted the idea of wanting to try something new, saying [...] "I want to try {{a different}} genre that’s why we decided {{to come up with a}} dance album," [...] recalling her dance performances onstage during concerts and how it will be some sort of experiment for her. She also wants people to know that she loves to dance, and that she dares to show a more sexy, sensual side for the album. In preparation, she decided to maintain physical fitness by working out, playing tennis, and practicing boxing everyday. She expressed hard work and exercise to improve her natural physique, proudly stating [...] "I want to be a role model when it comes to body.
