5|$|Only four volleyball players won {{medals and}} then coached indoor teams <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium.</b> Aside from Lang Ping, {{who led the}} United States' women to the silver in 2008, all were {{managers}} of their own country's team.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 Sydney Olympics saw Chambers {{come close}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium.</b> He easily {{qualified}} through the heat stages and achieved a season's best of 10.08s in the 100m final finishing fourth behind Greene, Ato Boldon and Obadele Thompson. Chambers {{was the best}} European 100m performer, but after disqualification in the relay he left the games without a medal.|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} later, the Zimbabwean players {{returned}} to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.|$|E

5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine {{is based on the}} ancient Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E

He qualified only 13th, but {{was still able to}} return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium,</b> clawing to the third place partly thanks to a safety car intervention {{in the middle of the}} race. At the , he qualified 9th and finished 5th.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 British Grand Prix at Silverstone {{was due to}} be {{the last}} in Northamptonshire, as the event was moving to Donington Park from the 2010 season. The race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull Racing, 15.1secs ahead of his {{teammate}} Mark Webber. A further 25.9secs behind was that regular visitor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium,</b> Barrichello, in his Brawn. However, due to Donington Park funding issues, the Grand Prix would remain at Silverstone until at least 2027.|$|E
25|$|The RX-7 also {{fared well}} at the Spa 24 Hours race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by Tom Walkinshaw Racing. After hours of battling with several BMW 530i's and Ford Capris, the RX-7 driven by Pierre Dieudonné and Tom Walkinshaw won the event. Mazda had turned the tables on BMW, who had beaten Mazda's Familia Rotary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR's {{prepared}} RX-7s also won the British Touring Car Championship in 1980 and 1981, driven by Win Percy.|$|E
50|$|Rudi Fischer was {{the first}} Swiss driver <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in Formula One. Despite only {{starting}} 7 Grands Prix he made <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> twice; with 2nd in Switzerland and 3rd in Germany, both in 1952. Those were his only points finishes.|$|R

25|$|Red Bull Racing {{finished}} second overall, {{after suffering a}} difficult start to the season when Sebastian Vettel retired and Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix. Red Bull appealed the disqualification, but the result was upheld by the International Court of Appeal. Vettel went on to finish third in Malaysia, while Ricciardo retired, and both drivers scored points in Bahrain and China. Ricciardo recorded his first podium finish with a third place in Spain, while Vettel recovered to fourth place after technical problems and a penalty for a gearbox change saw him start the race from fifteenth position. Ricciardo finished in third place in Monaco, while Vettel retired due to an issue with his power unit. Ricciardo {{took advantage of the}} Mercedes team's difficulties in Canada to claim his maiden Grand Prix victory—and Renault's first with a turbocharged engine since the 1986 Detroit Grand Prix—while Vettel finished third. The team struggled in their home race in Austria, with Vettel retiring early and Ricciardo finishing eighth. Ricciardo returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in Britain, while Vettel finished fifth after a protracted battle with Alonso. Vettel and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively in Germany. Ricciardo scored his second career win in Hungary, while Vettel finished seventh. Ricciardo scored his third career victory in Belgium while Vettel took fifth. In Italy, Ricciardo took fifth place, ahead of Vettel. Both drivers recorded podium finishes in Singapore. Vettel took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> with third place in Japan, ahead of Ricciardo. Ricciardo took seventh place in Russia, ahead of Vettel. Ricciardo returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in the United States, while Vettel finished in seventh after starting from pit lane following a complete change of his power unit. Vettel finished fifth in Brazil while Ricciardo retired when his front-left upright suspension was broken. Both drivers were thrown out of qualifying in Abu Dhabi after their cars failed scrutineering, and they started from the pit lane.|$|E
25|$|The 2017 {{edition of}} the squad, which {{included}} Brittani Lanzilli and Amber Greene, repeated 2013's trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> by again winning the bronze medal. Greene, Team USA's starting goalie, excelled throughout the tournament, finishing third among all netminders in both goals against average (3.00) and save percentage (0.929). She made 32 saves on 34 Japan shots in a key 3–2 U.S. pool round win that (eventually) allowed the team {{to advance to the}} semifinals, and then delivered a 28-save shutout of China in the bronze medal match.|$|E
25|$|Oudrid's three-act magnum opus, with text by Luis de Eguílaz, El molinero de Subiza, was {{presented}} at Teatro de la Zarzuela in 1870, which resulted in his switching over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> and the drama genre. His last work was Blancos y azules (1876), in association with Fernández Caballero. The 52-year-old Oudrid died unexpectedly of bacterial pneumonia at Teatro Real, in Madrid, on 13 March 1877, while preparing {{the performance of the}} opera Mignon by Ambroise Thomas. His death centennial was suggested to be celebrated with his musical El Molinero de Subiza.|$|E

50|$|During his career, Gundersen never {{finished}} off of <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in <b>the</b> final {{of either the}} Speedway World Team Cup or the Speedway World Pairs Championship, though he was unable <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> of <b>the</b> 1989 World Team Cup in which Denmark finished in third place.|$|R
50|$|Repeating his 2008 victory, {{he won the}} 2010 Grande Premio Internacional en Marcha Atletica {{meeting in}} Rio Maior, beating Yohann Diniz <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish line.

25|$|Károlyi mostly {{acted as}} a {{personal}} coach for Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics, but still managed to draw the spotlight. His motivational speech to Strug after she injured her ankle on her first vault ("Shake it off! You can do it!") was broadcast on television and was widely viewed. After Strug's successful final vault, Károlyi carried her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> to accept her gold medal. The moment was photographed and widely publicized, and it {{became one of the}} most enduring memories of the 1996 Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Although Hulme silenced {{many critics}} with his {{excellent}} win in Monaco, {{the race was}} marred by the appalling accident that would claim the life of Lorenzo Bandini, who was chasing Hulme {{at the time of}} the crash. His second Grand Prix win of 1967, was on the legendary Nordschleife of the Nürburgring. This victory proved his versatility on any type of track. A further six visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> gave Hulme the advantage he needed. He won the Championship by five points from Brabham, and a further five from Jim Clark. Hulme was the first (and to date, only) Formula One World Champion from New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Tolan {{became the}} first non-white winner of the event in 1932 and this {{signified}} {{the start of a}} prolonged period of success by black male sprinters; since 1932 only five men's Olympic champions in the event have not had significant African heritage. The women's event was dominated by runners of European descent until Wilma Rudolph won the title in 1960. Soviet and German women returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in the period from 1972 to 1980, but since then African-American and Jamaican women have won the great majority of 100m medals. Dominance in the men's event has been particularly pronounced from 1984 to 2016, during which time all the men's Olympic 100m finalists have been of African heritage.|$|E

25|$|Danielson lost {{a minute}} {{in the overall}} {{classification}} in stage 18, ending at the Col du Galibier, but remained ninth overall, with time gaps above and below him making it unlikely he would gain or lose any positions as the race went forward. He lost {{more time in the}} stage 20 individual time trial, but not his overall placement. That position held on the Tour's final stage the next day. Farrar was fourth in the final sprint, behind Cavendish, Boasson Hagen, and Greipel. The squad finished as winners of the teams classification. When going up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> to accept the award, the eight remaining riders and Vaughters brought with them a cardboard cutout of Zabriskie, the only team member who had to leave the race. Danielson's ninth-place finish extended the team's streak of placing a rider in the top ten each year they participated in the Tour.|$|E
25|$|In the men's series, {{the medals}} were {{expected}} to be taken from a combination of Alistair Brownlee, Jonny Brownlee and Javier Gómez. Alistair leapt {{to the top of the}} standings after Lausanne, allowing his only non podium finish of the year, 29th in Sydney, to drop off, and now leading his brother and Gómez into the final round. The top three points look like this going into the final round: Alistair is on 3085 points, Jonathan with 2965 points, and Gómez with 2858 points. Fourth place man Alexander Brukhankov remained a threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> with 2699 points. David Hauss was also still a candidate for the podium, sitting in fifth place going into Beijing on 2405 points. In Beijing, 1200 points were on offer to the winner, with 1100 to second and 1027 to third, where the 2011 World Champions will be crowned.|$|E
25|$|Stoner {{opened the}} 2008 {{season with a}} victory at Qatar, before a run of two races without a podium. He {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> with a second place at Mugello, before starting a run of seven successive pole positions. He turned three of them into successive victories—a lights-to-flag win at Donington, leading every lap at Assen six days later, and recovering from a huge Friday crash at Sachsenring {{to win in the}} wet after Dani Pedrosa crashed, moving to within 20 points of the championship lead. However, successive crashes while fighting for the lead at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca (where he remounted to finish second to Valentino Rossi), Brno and Misano ensured that he could not defend the title successfully. Stoner finished the 2008 season with six wins and was runner-up to Rossi with 280 points, the highest amount of points ever gained without taking the title at the time.|$|E
25|$|Born in Jarocin, {{as a young}} athlete he was a 3000 metres bronze medallist at the 1983 European Athletics Junior Championships, {{becoming}} <b>the</b> first Pole <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> in that event. He won the 5000m at the European Cup B Final.|$|R
50|$|Alistair Brownlee of Great Britain {{won gold}} in the men's triathlon, silver went to Spain's Javier Gómez and bronze to Alaistair's brother Jonathan Brownlee.
