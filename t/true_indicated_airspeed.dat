40|$|Blade-vortex {{interaction}} {{noise measurements}} are analyzed for an AS 350 B helicopter operated at 7000 ft eleva-tion above sea level. Blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise from four, 6 degree descent conditions are investigated with descents flown at 80 knot <b>true</b> and <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> {{as well as}} 4400 and 3915 pound take-off weights. BVI noise is extracted from the acquired acoustic signals {{by way of a}} previously developed time-frequency analysis technique. The BVI extraction technique is shown to provide a better localization of BVI noise, compared to the standard Fourier transform integration method. Using this technique, it was discovered that large changes in BVI noise amplitude occurred due to changes in vehicle gross weight. Changes in BVI noise amplitude were too large to be due solely to changes in the vortex strength caused by varying vehicle weight. Instead, it is suggested that vehicle weight modifies the tip-path-plane angle of attack, as well as induced inflow, resulting in large variations of BVI noise. It was also shown that defining flight conditions by <b>true</b> <b>airspeed,</b> rather than <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> provides more consistent BVI noise signals. Background The rotorcraft community is continually focused on the understanding, prediction, and mitigation of various noise mechanisms, including blade-vortex interaction (BVI) nois...|$|R
50|$|A great {{upgrade to}} the basic concept was {{introduced}} by Harry Wimperis, better known for his later {{role in the development}} of radar in England. In 1916 he introduced the Drift Sight, which added a simple system for directly measuring the wind speed. The bomb aimer would first dial in the altitude and airspeed of the aircraft. Doing so rotated a metal bar on the right side of the bombsight so it pointed out from the fuselage. Prior to the bomb run, the bomber would fly at right angles to the bomb line, and the bomb aimer would look past the rod to watch the motion of objects on the ground. He would then adjust the wind speed setting until the motion was directly along the rod. This action measured the wind speed, and moved the sights to the proper angle to account for it, eliminating the need for separate calculations. A later modification was added to calculate the difference between <b>true</b> and <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> which grows with altitude. This version was the Drift Sight Mk. 1A, introduced on the Handley Page O/400 heavy bomber. Variations on the design were common, like the US Estoppey bombsight.|$|R
50|$|Position error {{affects the}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and the <b>indicated</b> altitude. Aircraft {{manufacturers}} use the {{aircraft flight manual}} to publish details of the error in <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and <b>indicated</b> altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and equivalent airspeed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> {{is close}} to the true airspeed only at sea level in standard conditions and at low speeds. At 11,000 m, an <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> of 300 kn may correspond to a true airspeed of 500 kn in standard conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{error in}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> must also not be excessive. Part 23, §23.1323(b) {{includes}} the following requirement for the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicating</b> system: ...|$|R
25|$|The actual speeds {{represented}} by these designators {{are specific to}} a particular model of aircraft. They are expressed by the aircraft's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (and not by, for example, the ground speed), so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors, as aircraft instruments also show <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> (IAS) is the {{airspeed indicator}} reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{corrected}} for {{instrument and}} position error.|$|R
50|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator {{is used to}} measure <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) in knots.|$|R
50|$|At higher altitudes, the {{air density}} {{is lower than}} at sea level. Because of the {{progressive}} reduction in air density, as the aircraft’s altitude increases its true airspeed is progressively greater than its <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> For example, the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> at which an aircraft stalls can be considered constant, but the true airspeed at which it stalls increases with altitude.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated {{airspeed}} {{in knots}} is usually abbreviated as KCAS, while <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is abbreviated as KIAS.|$|R

5000|$|... for navigation, CAS is {{traditionally}} calculated {{as one of}} the steps between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and <b>true</b> airspeed; ...|$|R
50|$|At {{increased}} altitude (more accurately, density altitude), for {{the same}} given <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) the aircraft's true airspeed (TAS) will be higher, but the same <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> limits apply. Likewise, most efficient cruise speed, total drag, available lift, stall speed, and other aerodynamic information depend on calibrated, not true airspeed. Most aircraft exhibit a small difference between the airspeed actually shown on the instrument (<b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> or IAS) and the speed the instrument should theoretically show (calibrated airspeed or CAS). This difference, called position error, is mainly due to inaccurate sensing of static pressure. It is usually not possible to find a position for the static ports which, at all angles of attack, accurately senses the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.|$|R

2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying <b>airspeed</b> are <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density <b>airspeed.</b> [...] <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated <b>airspeed</b> is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. [...] True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|R
25|$|Calibrated <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{corrected}} for instrument errors, {{position error}} (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.|$|R
5000|$|An aircraft's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{in knots}} is {{typically}} abbreviated KIAS for [...] "Knots-Indicated Air Speed" [...] (vs. KCAS for calibrated airspeed and KTAS for true airspeed).|$|R
5000|$|The 33 FTS {{currently}} flies the T-6A [...] "Texan II" [...] {{which has}} 1100 shaft horsepower {{and a maximum}} speed of 316 KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The true {{airspeed}} (TAS; also KTAS, for knots {{true airspeed}}) of an aircraft is {{the speed of}} the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as the Global Positioning System has become available for civilian use, the importance of such analogue instruments has decreased. Since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is a better indicator of power used and lift available, True airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> [...] - [...] IAS or KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed)</b> [...] - [...] is used. However, since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> only shows <b>true</b> speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below 200 kn. Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account.|$|R

50|$|The aircraft, {{which left}} from Posadas and {{was due to}} land in Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, Buenos Aires, was forced to divert towards Fray Bentos to avoid a storm. Examination of the aircraft's flight data {{recorder}} (FDR) revealed that shortly after the diversion occurred, the aircraft airspeed indicator began to fall to an alarmingly low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> Unbeknownst to the pilots, this was caused not directly, by a loss of power, but by ice formed inside the pitot tube, which reads the airspeed for the indicator by measuring the pressure of inflow air. The ice obstructing the pitot tube reduced the air inflow, thus giving an erroneously low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator shows the aircraft's speed (usually in knots [...] ) {{relative to the}} surrounding air. It works by measuring the ram-air pressure in the aircraft's Pitot tube relative to the ambient static pressure. The <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) must be corrected for nonstandard pressure and temperature {{in order to obtain}} the true airspeed (TAS). The instrument is color coded to <b>indicate</b> important <b>airspeeds</b> such as the stall speed, never-exceed airspeed, or safe flap operation speeds.|$|R
