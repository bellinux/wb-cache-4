25|$|The {{township}} had {{an annual}} Night of Lights on the Forked River, {{which was a}} boat parade at night in August. Owners dressed up their boats with lights and sailed down the river at night to the Captain's Inn. This had been changed <b>to</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>the</b> River after the original family that supported the event withdrew from involvement. It is now sponsored by local business and organizations and known as the Lacey Lights Boat Parade.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{experimental}} recreations {{have proven}} {{that it is}} fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by ingenious use of ropes. Teams of workers would have worked <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> moai back and forth, creating the walking motion and holding the moai upright. If correct, it can be inferred that the fallen road moai {{were the result of}} the teams of balancers being unable to keep the statue upright, and it was presumably not possible to lift the statues again once knocked over. However, the debate continues.|$|E

500|$|One {{holdover}} {{from the}} latter {{stages of the}} Magic Tour was the [...] "Build Me a House" [...] stage rap, now located in [...] "Working on a Dream". Springsteen would say: [...] "We're not just here <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> house tonight. We're {{going to build a}} house....

500|$|Critics {{compared}} it to Trainor's previous single, [...] "All About That Bass". [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News referred to [...] "Lips Are Movin" [...] as a catchy ladies' anthem. [...] 4Music's Jessica Lever called it [...] "another pop classic", and said, [...] "with the same sass as her debut song, we're sure this one's also going <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> music world". Billboard said [...] "Lips Are Movin" [...] "is definitely {{in the same vein}} as 'All About That Bass,' which spells great things for the song...". Megan Friedman of Seventeen enjoyed the song's references to its predecessor, saying, [...] "when you need a pick-me-up song to help you brush off the haters, you can count on Meghan Trainor".|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the Twister Remix of [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was also directed by Ray Kay, and released on September 8, 2012. For the music video, Spears sported a $20,000 sports bra and black leggins from Body Rock. It begins with four girls talking and resting in a dance studio. Once Spears {{enters the room}} and starts playing Twister with the girls, the scenario changes to a stage with a colorful background, and they all start performing a dance routine to a remix of the song. After the song stops and the four girls are seen laying down tired, Spears turns around to them and say, [...] "Way <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> spots, ladies." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{image of}} spots is {{insufficient}} to reconstruct the whole crystal; it represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180°, with an image recorded at every step; actually, slightly more than 180° is required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the Ewald sphere. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90° or 45° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a [...] "blind spot" [...] in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis. It is customary <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> crystal slightly (by 0.5–2°) to catch a broader region of reciprocal space.|$|E
500|$|Show lengths were {{generally}} between 2 hours 30 minutes to 2 hours 45 minutes. [...] Springsteen scheduled his two Philadelphia {{shows at the}} soon-to-be-demolished Spectrum, commenting that [...] "They don't make arenas like this anymore" [...] and stating that the smaller size and lack of luxury boxes made the old venue [...] "ideal for rock shows." [...] The Spectrum had seen Springsteen's first headlining arena show in 1976 during the Born to Run tours, and now he said they would [...] "fulfill our solemn vow <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> Spectrum one more time." [...] Accordingly, the band played local act The Dovells' 1963 hit [...] "You Can't Sit Down" [...] among other Philadelphia-related selections. [...] Springsteen voiced similar sentiments about the old-but-still-going Nassau Coliseum, and selected The Soul Survivors' 1967 hit [...] "Expressway to Your Heart" [...] {{as a tribute to}} the nearby Long Island Expressway.|$|E
500|$|Music {{columnist}} Everett True {{referred to}} [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] as [...] "the most unsettling thing I've heard since Patti Smith uncovered [...] "Piss Factory"... only it's way more personal." [...] In the 1995 book The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll, music scholars Simon Reynolds and Joy Press {{reflected on the}} track, writing: [...] ""Teenage Whore" [...] turns the lowliest member of rock society, the groupie, into the ultimate (anti) heroine. Love rasps out an unclassifiable alloy of growling defiance and retching disgust, while Hole's torturous music grinds out her humiliation and hatred with a creakiness that betrays how long this howl has been lurking {{in the back of}} the throat." [...] Cultural theorist Jan Jagodzinski also reads the song as the narrative of a groupie and representing a [...] "desublimated ugly aesthetic of the abjected mother." [...] In The Rough Guide <b>to</b> <b>Rock,</b> <b>the</b> song is noted as [...] "coercing the listener into Love's anguish" [...] as well as representing the band's early stylistic choices and aesthetic, characterized by [...] "drone" [...] and featuring [...] "poetic turns of phrase." ...|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{become a}} popular {{character}} among audience of both genders for various reasons. Model and actress Jaime Bergman chose the [...] "quick and bold" [...] Ayane as a Dead or Alive 2 character she would partner with. While awarding the Annual GameSpy E3 Award to Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, Raymond 'Psylancer' Padilla wrote, [...] "Ayane should be my new girlfriend." [...] He later elaborated: [...] "To be honest, I always thought Ayane was an uptight bitch with a massive chip on her shoulder. I always rooted for Kasumi in their feud. Then {{a funny thing happened}} when I saw the trailer for Dead or Alive Ultimate during E3 2004 -- I started to care about Ayane. Learning more about her story, her upbringing, and the root of her feud with Kasumi made me change sides." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey also described himself as [...] "more of an Ayane sort of guy." [...] In 2005, she was described as his favourite Dead or Alive character by James Mielke from 1UP.com. Featuring Ayane as a [...] "videogame babe of the day" [...] in 2009, IGN's Chris Carle commented: [...] "After that awkward goth stage in high school, not many people continue <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> violet locks, but Ayane is different… she's hot enough to get away with it." [...] "Kayane", pseudonym of the professional gamer Marie-Laure Norindr comes from a mix of [...] "Kasumi" [...] and [...] "Ayane". Kayane said: [...] "She has a lot of charisma and is pretty. She’s full of anger but has a sweet heart in fact. I think she has the most interesting story and personality in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Carl Friedan {{had been}} {{quoted as saying}} [...] "She changed the course of history almost singlehandedly.

Unfortunately, she was that same person at home, where that kind of conduct doesn't work. She simply never {{understood}} this." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{system of}} {{tradition}} had already shifted dramatically {{by the time}} Julian came to power; gone were the days of massive sacrifices honoring the gods. The communal festivals that involved sacrifice and feasting, which once united communities, now tore them apart—Christian against pagan. [...] Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds) [...] had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church. [...] In all, Julian’s short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past. [...] Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> boat by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his recording work, Watson played Parson Nathaniel in the stage adaptation of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds which toured the UK in early 2006. In the same year, he also {{took part in the}} BBC reality TV show Just the Two of Us. The programme involved eight couples, including Siân Reeves and Watson, competing in a duet-singing showdown, complete with a live band, a panel of judges and viewer voting, to see who would be crowned champions. A wide array of music was performed, from country and western <b>to</b> <b>rock.</b> <b>The</b> scores each week were tallied from both a judging vote (the judges were Lulu, Trevor Nelson, Stewart Copeland and Cece Sammy) and a public phone-in vote. Watson, a late arrival to the competition replacing Reeves's original partner Rick Astley, who had pulled out, took the crown despite the low scores awarded by the judges to their performances. Following the competition Reeves and Watson released a victory single, [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love". Russell Watson was scheduled to defend his title in the 2007 series with a new celebrity partner, Loui Batley, but had to withdraw at the last minute because of serious health problems.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 December 1942, the Italian {{submarine}} Ambra of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) {{left the}} naval base of La Spezia, carrying three manned torpedoes and 10 commando frogmen. Air recoinnassance {{had discovered that}} the port of Algiers was crowded with Allied cargo ships, thus the Italian high command had decided to launch a combined operation involving both human torpedoes and combat swimmers carrying limpet mines. On the evening of 10 December, Ambra reached Algiers {{at a depth of}} [...] One of the swimmers was employed as scout on the surface, and he guided the submarine toward a position [...] from the southern entrance to the harbour. He spotted six steamers at 21:45, and informed the presence of targets to Ambra by phone. The other swimmers and the manned torpedoes begun to emerge at 23:45 after some delay. The observer reported an intense reaction from the harbour defences. The submarine awaited to recover the operators until 03:00, an hour after the original time set. Then the scout swimmer was recalled on board and Ambra departed back to La Spezia. Meanwhile, at 05:00, the explosions started <b>to</b> <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> freighters. Ocean Vanquisher (7,174tons) and the Norwegian Berta (1,493tons) sank, while [...] Empire Centaur (7,041tons) and Armatan (4,587tons) were heavily damaged. The American landing ship LSM-59 became stranded on the beach. Sixteen Italian divers were captured.|$|E
