5|$|Although his scripts are lauded {{for being}} literate, Sorkin {{has been criticized}} for often turning in scripts that are overwrought. His mentor William Goldman has commented that {{normally}} in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking <b>this</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} {{into the}} legions {{was restricted to}} Roman citizens only. <b>This</b> <b>rule,</b> which derived from the pre-Social War Republican army, was strictly enforced.

5|$|N. tazetta and its cultivars are an {{exception}} to <b>this</b> <b>rule,</b> requiring no cold period.

5|$|Seventy-five-move rule: Similar to the fifty-move rule; however, if {{the final}} {{move in the}} {{sequence}} resulted in checkmate, this takes precedence. As with the fivefold-repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by the players, and allows a tournament director to intervene. <b>This</b> <b>rule</b> likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E

The reporting requirements for licensees distributing byproduct material to persons exempt from licensing are being changed, obsolete provisions are being deleted, certain regulatory requirements are being clarified, and smoke detector distribution regulations are being simplified.

5|$|The {{name for}} <b>this</b> <b>rule,</b> Rule 184, is the Wolfram code {{describing}} the state table above: the bottom {{row of the}} table, 10111000, when viewed as a binary number, {{is equal to the}} decimal number 184.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>rule</b> of {{tincture}} {{is often}} broken in clerical arms: {{the flag and}} arms of Vatican City notably have yellow (gold) and white (silver) placed together.

Because gold and silver express sublimity and solemnity, {{combinations of the two}} are often used regardless of the rule of tincture.|$|E
5|$|According to the Government Proceedings Act, civil {{proceedings}} against the Government must be commenced against an appropriate authorized Government department. If {{there is no}} appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence proceedings has reasonable doubt as to which department (if any) is appropriate, proceedings should be commenced against the Attorney-General. <b>This</b> <b>rule</b> applies to judicial review proceedings in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought.|$|E
5|$|Adderall {{has been}} {{banned in the}} National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA).

5|$|An {{exception}} to <b>this</b> <b>rule</b> occurs during medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as}} the Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. <b>This</b> <b>rule</b> was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major exception to <b>this</b> <b>rule</b> was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross {{on his forehead}} and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for <b>this</b> <b>rule</b> is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. <b>This</b> <b>rule</b> was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to <b>this</b> <b>rule</b> and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E
