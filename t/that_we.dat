5|$|I {{hope that}} {{all the people who}} see us will be happy in knowing <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew each other, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} for us, my brothers, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us.

5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do - we bring out elements <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to emphasise.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{cautions}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot feel or intuit {{this world}} of the understanding. He also stresses <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are unable to make interesting positive claims about it {{because we are not}} able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not entitled to.|$|E
