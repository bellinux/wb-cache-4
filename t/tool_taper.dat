In recent years, machining of the so called “difficult to cut ” materials has become an important issue in several sectors. Micro Electrical Discharge Machining (micro-EDM) thanks to its contactless nature, {{is one of the}} most important technologies for the machining of this type of materials and it can be considered as one of the most promising manufacturing technologies for the fabrication of micro components. One of the most relevant applications of micro-EDM is micro-drilling. Micro holes in fact, are widely used for example in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), serving as channels or nozzles to connect two micro-features, and in micro-mechanical components. The present study is about micro drilling of metal plates by means of micro-EDM technology. In particular, the aim of this work is to investigate the effects of the “downsizing ” of the micro holes diameter on the drilling performances. The influence of the reduction of the diameters in terms of both process performances (e. g., <b>tool</b> wear, <b>taper</b> rate, diametrical overcut) and general quality of the holes was investigated. Steel plates having thickness equal to 0. 8 mm were taken into account.

By suitably modifying the dimensions of the tooling components, the basic design of the tooling can readily be adapted to other structures that must be maintained in alignment. The <b>tooling</b> includes <b>tapered,</b> internally threaded alignment pins designed to fit in the bolt holes in one of the mating structures, plus a draw bolt and a cup that are used to install or remove each alignment pin. In preparation for disassembly of two mating structures, external supports are provided to prevent unintended movement of the structures. During disassembly of the structures, as each bolt that joins the structures is removed, an alignment pin is installed in its place. Once all the bolts have been removed and replaced with pins, the pins maintain alignment as the structures are gently pushed or pulled apart on the supports. In assembling the two structures, one reverses the procedure described above: pins are installed in the bolt holes, the structures are pulled or pushed together on the supports, then the pins are removed and replaced with bolts.

The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study. Welded specimens using taper pin ratio 6 : 1 shows higher tensile strength compared to other taper pin ratio up to 204 MPa.
