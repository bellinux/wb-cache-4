On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E

5|$|In the italic, <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> ascenders of Tagliente's type were {{shortened}} and the curl to {{the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Past NY182, I-190 {{turns to}} the northwest, {{skirting}} the northeastern edge of Niagara Falls and roughly paralleling NY265 to the east. In Lewiston, the expressway meets NY31 at exit24 southwest of the large Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant reservoir. I-190 continues onward, crossing the canal between the reservoir and the power plant on a small dam also used by NY265. The freeway then interchanges with NY265, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and NY104 at <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> exit25 before curving {{to the west and}} terminating at the approach to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge. Across the bridge in Queenston, Ontario, the roadway becomes Highway405.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>expansive</b> {{cultural}} {{history of the}} park has been documented by the 1,000 archeological sites that have been discovered.

Yellowstone was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976, and a UN World Heritage Site on September 8, 1978. The park {{was placed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger from 1995 to 2003 due to the effects of tourism, infection of wildlife, and issues with invasive species. In 2010, Yellowstone National Park was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.|$|E

5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E

5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate {{leaned on}} the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he {{leaned on the}} high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The slow-moving {{hurricane}} battered the Texas shoreline {{for several}} days from October3 through 5, and continued eastward parallel to the Gulf Coast. It passed the Sabine River {{on the night of}} October5–6, and later struck southeastern Louisiana near Venice. At New Orleans, the worst of the storm came late on October6 with winds from the south and southeast. Extensive damage to forests in interior Louisiana and Mississippi indicated that the strongest winds occurred away from the coast, on the northern side of the hurricane's circulation. This was likely the result of a tight pressure gradient between the storm and <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> high pressure area centered over the Ohio Valley. According to weather historian David Ludlum, the storm likely moved ashore between Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. Although the cyclone's path across the southern United States is uncertain, it was located along the coast of the Carolinas as a minimal hurricane by October8, and subsequently exited into the Atlantic. It continued northeastward, ultimately passing north of Bermuda as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|With many {{residents}} employed at <b>the</b> <b>expansive</b> Newport News Shipbuilding, the joint U.S. Air Force-U.S. Army installation at Joint Base Langley–Eustis, {{and other military}} bases and suppliers, the city's economy is very connected to the military. The location on the harbor and along the James River facilitates a large boating industry which {{can take advantage of}} its many miles of waterfront. Newport News also serves as a junction between the rails and the sea with the Newport News Marine Terminals located at the East End of the city. Served by major east-west Interstate Highway 64, it is linked to others of the cities of Hampton Roads by the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway, which crosses the harbor on two bridge-tunnels. Part of the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport is in the city limits.|$|E
