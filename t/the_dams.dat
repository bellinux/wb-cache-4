5|$|The lake {{features}} three earth fill dams, two {{located on}} either side of the valley and one on the north rim. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> utilized nearby materials, and was one of the largest earthworks projects in the United States. Excavation of core materials for <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> resulted in many paleontological finds, all of which are displayed at the Western Science Center at the lake's East end. The lake is open to boating and fishing, along with hiking and other recreational activities around the lake.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of <b>the</b> <b>dams.</b> Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity <b>dam,</b> <b>the</b> {{force that}} holds <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> in place against the push {{from the water}} is Earth's gravity pulling down on the mass of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> tending to overturn <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of <b>the</b> <b>dam).</b> <b>The</b> <b>dam's</b> weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> <b>the</b> other way about its toe. The designer ensures that <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is heavy enough that <b>the</b> <b>dam's</b> weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and water pressure on <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{independent}} civil {{investigation of}} <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> failure attributed several possible conditions {{and practices that}} {{may have led to}} <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> failure. For example, the State of Hawaii did not adequately inspect <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and did not have enough dam inspectors to cover all of <b>the</b> antiquated <b>dams</b> in <b>the</b> state. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> (James Pflueger) performed grading operations near <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> without permits and may have filled in the emergency spillway for <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> Neither <b>the</b> current nor prior owners of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> maintained <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> adequately. Finally, <b>the</b> County of Kauai knew about the unpermitted grading operation, but did not enforce a stop-work order.|$|R
50|$|The Vaigai Reservoir, often {{known as}} <b>the</b> Virahanoor <b>Dam,</b> {{is a small}} <b>dam</b> on <b>the</b> River Vaigai. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is 10 km from Madurai city, between Madurai and Sivagangai on the Rameshwaram {{national}} highway 49. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is {{commonly referred to as}} Virahanoor Dam because is sited by the village of Virahanoor. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is under <b>the</b> maintenance of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD). A small park is also maintained near <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is to use the water for irrigation purpose for the areas around <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|R
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing <b>the</b> <b>dams.</b> (<b>The</b> <b>dams</b> can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
5|$|I {{heard about}} drowned farms and hamlets, the ruination of the salmon-fishing and how Inverness might be washed away if <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> failed inland. I was {{told about the}} huge veins of crystal they found when they were {{tunnelling}} deep under the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal day and {{afternoon}} bank fishing permits {{are available at}} Woodford Lodge. The restrictions imposed by Bristol Water mean that no fishing is allowed from <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> or stone embankments, the sailing club, in front of Stratford bird hide, {{in front of the}} picnic areas and in the nature reserve. There is a fleet of 32 motor boats for hire to fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{total length}} of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is 1700 m. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> creates Stanley Reservoir. The Mettur Hydro Electrical power project is also quite large. <b>The</b> <b>dam,</b> <b>the</b> park, the major {{hydroelectric}} power stations, and hills {{on all sides}} make Mettur a tourist attraction. Upstream from <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is Hogenakal Falls. The maximum level of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is 120 ft and the maximum capacity is 93.47 tmc ft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dam</b> cost $6,000,000, {{with the}} total {{reclamation}} project costing $18,000,000. Owyhee was designed by Frank A. Banks, who also designed other <b>dams</b> such as <b>the</b> Grand Coulee <b>Dam</b> on <b>the</b> Columbia River. In the 1980s, electricity-generating capabilities were added to <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> From 1990 to 1993, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was remodeled. Since the height of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> made a fish ladder impractical, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> closed off <b>the</b> Owyhee Chinook salmon runs that used to swim as far upstream as Nevada. On September 23, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places as part of <b>the</b> Owyhee <b>Dam</b> Historic District.|$|R
5|$|Since 1900, {{more than}} 15 large dams and many smaller ones {{have been built}} in the Willamette's {{drainage}} basin, and 13 of them are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). <b>The</b> <b>dams</b> are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite <b>the</b> <b>dams,</b> other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river's lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The rare floods that do {{break free}} of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and weirs of the Murray-Darling system have their {{magnitude}} and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.|$|E
5|$|To let {{the river}} {{replenish}} itself, most of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> {{that had been}} built were removed in 1893. Ten years later it had somewhat recovered, and people were again using it for drinking water and swimming.|$|E
50|$|There are severals ways dams can {{be removed}} and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> <b>the</b> amount of {{sediment}} behind <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> <b>the</b> aquatic environment below <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> who owns <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and what their priorities are, and <b>the</b> timeframe of <b>dam</b> removal are all factors that affect how <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> will be removed. Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, <b>the</b> cost of <b>dam</b> removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of <b>the</b> most common <b>dam</b> removal methods are described below.|$|R
50|$|Feasibility {{studies for}} <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{were carried out}} between May 1967 to May 1969 and designs between September 1970 to December 1977. Initial {{construction}} on <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> began in 1974 and it was complete in 1980. The first of <b>the</b> <b>dam's</b> generators was commissioned in 1980 and the last by 1991. The original cost of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{was estimated to be}} $45 million but because <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was constructed on a fault line, <b>the</b> <b>dam's</b> foundation had to be reinforced which raised the cost to $114 million.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is a {{concrete}} double curvature arch-type and 230 m high from the foundation. [...] <b>The</b> arch <b>dam</b> design {{is an ideal}} one for a dam built in a narrow, rocky gorge to hold back water in a reservoir. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is curved. Because of the arch shape, {{the force of the}} backed up water presses downward against <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and has <b>the</b> effect of strengthening <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> foundation. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> withholds a reservoir with a surface area of 29 km2 and capacity of [...] <b>The</b> <b>dam's</b> first study was conducted in 1995 and river diversion began in 1997. Concrete pouring began in 2006 and the power plant began producing electricity in November 2010. On December 11, 2010, the second generator for <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> became operational and was connected to <b>the</b> grid. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> will eventually have an installed capacity of 1,020 MW. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> was inaugurated on 6 July 2011 by Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad.|$|R
5|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They argued that <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> would improve navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide electricity for the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver cities, as occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
500|$|The {{force of}} the {{impoundment}} creates a downward thrust upon the mass of <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> greatly increasing <b>the</b> weight of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> on its foundation. This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the underlying foundation of <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> at <b>the</b> interface between <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and its stream bed.|$|R
5000|$|Toston Dam {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC). <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> includes inflatable Flashboards made of rubber at the crest of <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> which can be used to raise <b>the</b> <b>dam's</b> height slightly (so that more water may be retained). Toston Reservoir, behind <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> has a storage capacity of [...] of water. About 23600 acre of land are irrigated by <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{completion}} of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> in 1928 both {{the town and the}} crossing were relocated due to the rising waters impounded by <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> road crossing moved to the top of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> bridge was then destroyed by dynamite.|$|R
5|$|Rivington is {{situated}} on the moorland fringe between the high unenclosed moorland of the West Pennine Moors and the fields below. The landscape is characterised by marginal pastures with isolated farmsteads, reservoirs and disused mines and quarries scattered across the hillsides. There is an extensive network of footpaths providing public access. The reservoir valleys are dominated by expanses of water and the Victorian gothic architecture of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and embankments surrounded by woodland.|$|E
5|$|The Missouri River is {{the largest}} and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, the James, the Big Sioux, and the White. Essentially all of South Dakota's rivers {{are part of the}} Missouri River Valley. Dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and Lewis and Clark Lake. Hydroelectricity {{generated}} from power plants at <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> provides approximately half of the electricity used by South Dakotans.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the main}} stem of the Columbia River has 14dams, of which three are in Canada and 11 in the US. Four mainstem dams and four lower Snake River dams contain {{navigation}} locks to allow ship and barge {{passage from the}} ocean as far as Lewiston, Idaho. The river {{system as a whole}} has more than 400dams for hydroelectricity and irrigation. <b>The</b> <b>dams</b> address a variety of demands, including flood control, navigation, stream flow regulation, storage and delivery of stored waters, reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations, and the generation of hydroelectric power.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Grande Dixence <b>Dam</b> is a 285 m high, 700 m long {{concrete}} gravity <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is 200 m wide {{at its base}} and 15 m wide at its crest. <b>The</b> <b>dam's</b> crest reaches an altitude of 2365 m. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> structure contains approximately [...] of concrete. To secure <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> to <b>the</b> surrounding foundation, a grout curtain surrounds <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> reaching a depth of 200 m and extending 100 m {{on each side of}} the valley.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dam</b> {{is managed}} by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> is a 22.8m tall Gravity <b>dam.</b> <b>The</b> Ashibetsu <b>dam</b> was {{constructed}} as part of <b>the</b> Katsurazawa <b>Dam</b> project. <b>The</b> construction of <b>the</b> Katsurazawa <b>Dam</b> led to <b>the</b> creation of the artificial lake known as Lake Ashibetsu which <b>the</b> Ashibestu <b>Dam</b> is named after.|$|R
50|$|Feasibility {{studies for}} <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{occurred}} in 1971 and in June 1977, construction on <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> began.

In total, American forces suffered 24,000 combat casualties and had failed to reach their original objectives, <b>the</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|E
5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote {{conservation}} in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid {{from the trees}} used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E
