40|$|NOVELTY - A sludge {{dewatering}} <b>test</b> <b>press</b> uses reverse pressure during sample preparation DETAILED DESCRIPTION - During the {{sludge dewatering}} process, additives {{are introduced to}} assist the process, the efficiency of which is evaluated by a sample. The sludge sample is mixed with a defined quantity of the additive and subjected to compression. The efficacy is judged based on {{one or more of}} the filtrate properties and one or more properties of the resulting filter cake. During the compression test process, the filtrate is pressed against the direction of flow in the test sedimentation unit. The press consists of a housing (2) resting on a base plate (1) and having a removable cap (9) incorporating a fluid outlet (10) which rests on a removable filter plate (12) and filter (13). The housing contains a piston (3) which rises vertically. The press can be linked to an appropriate computer-control and data logger unit. USE - Process and test assembly to determine the efficacy of sludge de- wa tering agents especially organic poly electrolytes, alone or in combination with other organic or inorganic substances. ADVANTAGE - The test assembly provides a better simulation of the full-scale process on a laboratory scale.
