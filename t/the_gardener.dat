5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gardener</b> {{must follow}} the true artist, however modestly, in his respect for {{things as they}} are, in delight in natural form and beauty of flower and tree, {{if we are to}} be free from barren geometry, and if our gardens are ever to be true pictures....And as the artist's work is to see for us and {{preserve}} in pictures some of the beauty of landscape, tree, or flower, so the gardener's should be to keep for us as far as may be, in the fulness of their natural beauty, the living things themselves.|$|E

50|$|A Spanish story {{involving}} sexual {{jealousy and}} selfishness appears in Lope de Vega's play El Perro del Hortelano (<b>The</b> <b>Gardener's</b> Dog, in 1618). In this case, De Vega's title {{alludes to the}} parallel European idiom involving a variant story in which a gardener sets his dog to guard his cabbages (or lettuces). After <b>the</b> <b>gardener's</b> death <b>the</b> dog continues to forbid people access to the beds, giving rise to the simile 'He's like <b>the</b> <b>gardener's</b> dog that eats no cabbage and won't let others either' or, for short, 'playing <b>the</b> <b>gardener's</b> dog' (faire le chien du jardinier).|$|R

5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by <b>the</b> <b>gardener.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1723, {{six days}} before his death, Cosimo III {{distributed}} a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves {{the right to choose}} his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested his liberal policies: he repealed all of his father's anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the royal palace, the Pitti, for the Villa La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete's house and gardens with the assistance of Sebastiano Rapi, <b>the</b> <b>gardener</b> of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished the villa further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.|$|E

5000|$|De Vega's title {{relates to}} the {{parallel}} European idiom current in Dutch, Danish, German, French, Portuguese and Italian as well. It refers to a variant story in which a gardener sets his dog to guard his cabbages (or lettuces).

50|$|There {{are many}} ways by which {{unwanted}} pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on <b>the</b> pest, <b>the</b> <b>gardener's</b> goals, and <b>the</b> <b>gardener's</b> philosophy.

25|$|Marie {{admitted}} this, but {{she made}} <b>the</b> <b>gardener</b> confirm that {{she gave him the}} arsenic to make rat-poison paste out of it. Their fears were momentarily allayed, but the next day, white residue was found {{at the bottom of a}} glass of sugar water that Marie had administered to Charles. A third doctor, René de Lespinasse, was called on 13 January. He suspected poison, but by then it was too late: Charles died a few hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{justice of}} the peace from Brive, Moran, arrived at Le Glandier on 15 January.

Then <b>the</b> <b>gardener</b> revealed that Marie had given him arsenic with which to make rat-poison paste in December as well as January. Strangely, the paste could be found all over the house, untouched by the rats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1882 Daimler moved to Cannstatt just outside of Stuttgart at that time, {{purchasing}} a cottage in Cannstatt's Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG. Maybach followed in September of that year. In the garden, they added a brick extension to the roomy glass-fronted summer house and this became their workshop. Their activities alarmed the neighbors who reported them to the police as suspected counterfeiters. The police obtained a key from <b>the</b> <b>gardener</b> and raided the house in their absence, but found only engines.|$|E

In classic Enkian fashion, the father advises Shukaletuda to hide in the city where Inanna {{will not be able to}} find him. Enki, as the protector of whoever comes to seek his help, and as the empowerer of Inanna, here challenges the young impetuous goddess to control her anger so as to be better able to function as a great judge.|$|E
25|$|Not only is {{the state}} of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the {{principle}} of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions {{to the needs of the}} forms of plant life which <b>the</b> <b>gardener</b> desires to raise.|$|E

Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door and looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. <b>The</b> <b>gardener</b> immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E
