5000|$|TVET has an {{important}} role to play in <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion</b> through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as information technology and the green economy has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.|$|E

50|$|Capacity {{building}} of individual researchers and institutions in Africa {{is an integral}} part of all its research and development activities. icipe's Capacity Building Programme aims to promote the development and use of sustainable arthropod management technologies by enhancing the research and training capabilities of countries in Africa. The centre’s efforts are geared towards three major areas of activity which include the training of African nationals for leadership roles in insect science, enhancing national capacities for <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion,</b> adoption and utilisation and facilitating the dissemination and exchange of information. In turn, these objectives are realized through three key programmes: postgraduate training at PhD and MSc levels, the professional development schemes for scientists of any nationality and the non-degree training courses for scientists, community members and extension workers. The ARPPIS programme, a partnership with 32 African universities, with financial support from German Academic Exchange Programme, offers three-year doctoral research fellowships, aimed at preparing young scholars from Africa for regional leadership roles, as well as internationally competitive research careers, in arthropod-related sciences.|$|E

50|$|Social {{innovation}} {{was discussed}} {{in the writings of}} figures such as Peter Drucker and Michael Young (founder of the Open University and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s. It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as Pierre Rosanvallon, Jacques Fournier, and Jacques Attali. However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. Benjamin Franklin, for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century reformers like Robert Owen, founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including Karl Marx, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim focused attention on broader processes of social change. Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress {{at the center of the}} theory. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, addressed the process of innovation directly with his theory of creative destruction and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys what {{is known}} about the extent of {{international}} <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion</b> and channels through which technology spreads. Productivity differences explain much of the variation in incomes across countries, and technology {{plays a key role in}} determining productivity. The pattern of worldwide technical change is determined largely by international <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion</b> because a few rich countries account for most of the world's creation of new technology. Cross-country income convergence turns on whether <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion</b> is global or local. There is no indication that international diffusion is inevitable or automatic, but rather, domestic technology investments are necessary. Better understanding of what determines the effectiveness of <b>technology</b> <b>diffusion</b> sheds light on the pace at which the world's technology frontier may expand. ...|$|E
