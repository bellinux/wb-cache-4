5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> spaniel. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes).

Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E

5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> blood.

5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.|$|E
5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness.

5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E

Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E

5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E
5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
