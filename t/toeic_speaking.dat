D. and Muhammad Handi Gunawan, M. Pd. The research analyses the implementation and implication of interview as a technique to assess the students’ speaking ability. Mix methods research design was used to obtain the data. The data were gathered from 10 eleventh grade students and taken from observation and tests. The tests administered in this research were <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test and interview test. The qualitative data were taken from observation. The observation was conducted during the interview test to see the implementatation of interview. The quantitative data {{were taken from the}} students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and interview test score. The speaking assessment criteria used to score the students’ speaking ability through interview was the combination of IELTS and Adam and Frith speaking assessment criteria. The students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and the interview score were computed by using Pearson Product Moment Correlation formula to see the implication of interview. The findings showed that the implementation of interview was appropriate based on some steps by Underhill (1987). Besides, the interview had covered the components defined by Harris (1969) {{in the form of the}} IELTS-Adam and Frith speaking assessment criteria. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and interview test score was 0, 7. It indicated thatthe correlation was strong and positive. This study brought to a close that interview is a good and appropriate technique to assess the students’ speaking ability. However, some consideration should be made in the relation of time, setting, and the topic of the interview. Keywords: Interview, Speaking Assessment, <b>TOEIC</b> <b>Speaking</b> Tes...|$|E
30|$|Huang (2016) {{examined}} how strategies impacted test takers’ performance in six tasks of the <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test, also a computer-based test. Of the 215 Taiwanese students tested, eight {{were chosen for}} the stimulated recall. A 41 -item self-designed inventory was drawn up from this data to collect quantitative data. The inventory {{was based on the}} taxonomy from previous studies (e.g. Barkaoui et al. 2013; Huang 2013; Swain et al. 2009). Focusing on three broad strategy categories, namely, cognitive, communication and affective, Huang (2016) employed exploratory factor analysis and structural equalling model (SEM) to analyse the data. He reported that cognitive and communication strategies positively affected performance. Communication strategies impacted performance more directly than cognitive strategies.|$|E

Short-term intensive on-line English conversation lessons used with the pedagogy is applied to 4 th grader students as a trial basis. In this paper, first the teaching pedagogy, Callan Method {{known as one of}} the Direct Methods is briefly introduced. Then, in order to confirm the effectiveness of this method, the above-mentioned two English skills are tested before and after the trial by TOEIC IP Test and <b>TOEIC</b> <b>Speaking</b> Test, respectively. As a result, although the effectiveness of this method associated with speaking skill was not verified, that of listening skill was confirmed.

40|$|The TOEIC ® Listening and Reading test is an {{assessment}} of proficiency in English language as it {{is used in the}} global workplace, where English is the means of communication among both native and non-native speakers. Since 1979, the TOEIC test scores have informed decisions regarding recruitment, job placement, promotion, and training, and the test has been widely recognized as a worldwide standard in the assessment of international English use. In January 2003, a team of content and statistical analysis specialists was formed to consider a redesign of the TOEIC Listening and Reading test as it then existed. The test redesign coincided with an effort to investigate the possibility of making high quality <b>TOEIC</b> <b>Speaking</b> and Writing tests available to test score users as additional test components. Information about the development and design of the constructed response modules is available separately. This document focuses on the redesign of the TOEIC Listening and Reading test. The goals of the redesign project were: 1. bring the test into alignment with current theories of language proficiency, 2. identify the major variables contributing to the difficulty of language tasks on the revised test using evidence-centered design (ECD) methodology to, and 3. provide more proficiency information that is meaningful to test takers and score users. The TOEIC redesign team was able to utilize and build on the theoretical and research base for English language learning and testing that had been developed {{over the course of a}} decade by the TOEFL iBT ™ project. The history and findings of that project have been documented in detail and published in book form. The theoretical underpinnings of language proficiency are documented in the new TOEF...|$|E
