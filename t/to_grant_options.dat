40|$|This article {{considers}} the recent expansion of state immigration policy, focusing on how states {{have chosen to}} enter a field where federal dominance has been the norm. Using state immigration legislation in 2006 and 2007, we find that states exercise their authority in two ways. First, federal immigration laws often delegate tasks {{to state and local}} agencies or are structured <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>options</b> for state participation. Second, states frequently create immigration policy by legislating in areas that are not directly about, but are related to immigration, thereby allowing them to develop de facto immigration policies without overstepping their restricted authority in this sphere. Even though states' activity may be spurred by frustration with the failure of Congress to reform immigration laws, cooperation—not conflict—is the norm.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Share options {{have become}} a popular, {{frequently}} rewarding and incentive-providing form of remuneration for executive directors and other employees. Previous international {{research has shown that}} the firm's decision to grant share options may be influenced by its financial reporting situation; its tax position; the existence of conflicting interests between management and other stakeholders; as well as the firm's size and liquidity situation. The reasons why the conflict of interest {{has been found to be}} significantly associated with the granting of share options is because share options can align the interests of management with those of the shareholders and in so doing reduce the extent of agency costs. The lack of an accounting requirement to recognise share options as an expense has also been found to influence the firms' decision to grant share options depending on its financial reporting position. The firm's tax position has also been associated with the decision <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>options</b> based on the fact that firms cannot obtain a tax deduction for the value of share options granted. Finally, large firms with liquidity constraints have been found to be more likely to grant share options, due to the lack of available cash reserves for the payment of salaries. There has been no research as to whether the above explanatory variables influence the granting of share options by South African firms. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the variables that were identified internationally as being associated with share option grants apply to grants made to South African executive directors. This study examines whether the extent of share options granted is associated with various financial reporting and tax indicators, proxies for agency costs, the firm's size and its liquidity. Data from 61 firms over 2000 and 2001 was obtained. A total of 33 firms that granted share options were examined together with 28 firms that did not. The value of share options was measured using the dividend-adjusted Black Scholes model, and the dependent variable was calculated to be the value of share options granted during the year divided by the sum of the value of share options granted and the annual cash salary paid to the executives. This variable was regressed against thirteen independent variables identified in previous research. The results of this research indicate strongly that the larger the finn and the greater the extent of future growth opportunities (represented by the ratio of research and development to total assets), the more likely it is that finns will grant options, both of which are consistent with existing theoty. Option granting behaviour was also found to differ across industries and there was some evidence that the more difficult it is to monitor executive's performance (represented by the ratio of the variance in return on equity to the variance in share price), the more likely it is that the finn will grant options. Variables that were statistically significant but in the opposite direction to what was expected were growth in assets and the market-to-book ratio, both of which were negatively correlated with option granting behaviour. TIlls inconsistency may however be due to the fact that the data from the sample may not be a true reflection of the population. Financial reporting incentives, tax disincentives, liquidity, and two proxies for agency costs (the variance of market-adjusted returns and the ratio of the variance of marketadjusted returns to total returns) were not found to be significantly associated with option granting. TIlls suggests that the lack of a requirement to recognise share options as an expense; no deductions of share options for tax purposes; the fact that executive's choose to invest in projects that yield highly variable returns; and that finns that have a large amount of noise in their share price relative to the market, do not influence the decision to grant share options in South Africa. It therefore appears that the key drivers for granting share options to South African executive directors are finn size, unclear signals between earnings performance and the quality of manager's decisions and the desire to reduce agency costs by encouraging managers to focus on long-term investment opportunities...|$|E

The elasticity of pay-to-performance sensitivities with respect to stock price decreases is about 0. 7 and is larger for high-option executives and for executives with high percentages of options already underwater. The dominant mechanism through which companies offset declines in option pay-to-performance sensitivities is larger <b>option</b> <b>grants</b> following stock price declines; on average, these larger grants restore approximately 40 % of the stock-price-induced pay-to-performance sensitivity declines.

40|$|Throughout twentieth century, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common for executives to be remunerated with stock options, contracts which allow the recipient to buy company stock at a predetermined price, thus giving the incentive to maximize the stock price in order to increase the value of the stock option contract. Not only has stock option compensation become increasingly prevalent to executives at most major listed companies, but also to employees {{at all levels of the}} firm, both big and small. However, along with the growth in popularity, stock option compensation also became a topic of contention, not only among the general public, but among lobbyists, legislators and academics. This thesis aims to provide a better understanding of stock option compensation practice, with a particular emphasis on the United States, where stock option compensation is most prevalent. The thesis is divided into three chapters: the first chapter deals with establishing a foundational understanding of stock option practice and possible drivers through investigating the literature on the history of stock option compensation practice in the US. The second chapter develops a holistic theoretical model of an optimal stock option compensation package to possibly explain some practice currently considered as excessive. Then lastly, the third chapter empirically tests the validity of possible drivers of executive stock option policy in recent times in an attempt to identify whether current practice is optimal or not. The first chapter is primarily a literature review, covering a series of events over the history of stock option compensation in the US, ranging from its early beginnings in the early twentieth century until the present day. Included in the coverage of significant events are: legislation impacting tax benefits for corporate and for recipients; “landmark” events such as the first case of “broad-based” option compensation resulting in companies following a standard business practice; trends in the stock market; academic theory of the development of agency theory which supports the use of tools such as equity based compensation, and the development of major option valuation models; the possible impact of accounting standards; and the possibly impact of major bankruptcies or unethical behavior directly or indirectly tied to executive stock option compensation. The second chapter follows with a theoretical approach to understanding stock option compensation trends by analyzing the major benefits and costs associated with stock options. The model developed differs to most other existing optimization models as it does not focus on one set of benefits or factors, rather a more holistic approach is taken. Using a holistic approach, this model also helps explain how levels of compensation that are considered excessive under an optimisation model based only incentive benefits, can actually be optimal for the firm once other costs and benefits are incorporated. The model also aims to provide an alternative explanation to the managerial power hypothesis to explain why the buoyancy of the market may be positively correlated with compensation levels. This is explained by the impact of the buoyancy of the market on the likelihood of stock option exercise, and the costs and benefits either unconditional, partially conditional or conditional on options being exercised. In addition, smaller companies are also found to benefit from stock options more than larger firms due to some of the unconditional benefits, in particular, the ability to attract higher quality talent which can also help small firms fulfil untapped potential. Lastly, the model also provides useful insight into the appropriateness of using of foregone option premiums as the economic opportunity cost of <b>granting</b> stock <b>options.</b> The third chapter aims to empirically test the impact of several factors brought up in Chapter One that may help explain changes in compensation that occurred at the turn of the century. These major factors analyzed are: 1) the bull market prior to and the bear market following the market crash of 2000, 2) changes in accounting standards for equity based compensation, and 3) possible public perception of corruption following several major bankruptcies associated with poor ethics in 2002. Mixed evidence is found regarding the impact of market cycles. These findings include cycles to be linked <b>to</b> <b>granting</b> <b>options</b> out-of-the-money, a general inverse relationship with the levels of stock option compensation with the buoyancy of the market, expected for companies managing incentives, and finally there are indications companies ceased <b>granting</b> <b>options</b> based on poor company stock price performance prior to 2001. Other findings indicate the possible influence of accounting standards on economic decisions as well as the broad impact of events surrounding 2001 - 2, even though they have no economic impact. On the one hand, decreases in stock option compensation levels is shown to be linked to accounting decisions, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the argument that firm-wide decision making <b>to</b> cease <b>granting</b> stock <b>options</b> completely was based on accounting decisions...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates three {{hypotheses}} simultaneously: 1) {{the timing}} of the executive stock <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> dates, 2) {{the timing of}} the news around those dates, and 3) whether the <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> dates are backdated retroactively. The data comes from the Amsterdam stock exchange. The empirical results provide evidence that that there are no significant abnormal cumulative returns in the period before the <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> date. However, we find significant abnormal cumulative returns during a period of 30 trading days after the <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> date, even for scheduled <b>options</b> <b>granted</b> before September 1, 2002. In addition, we have formed four different subsamples: scheduled and unscheduled <b>option</b> <b>grants,</b> and, accounting for a change of the rulings as of September 1 st, 2002 <b>options</b> <b>granted</b> before and after the latter date. Significant differences in the means of abnormal returns of the various sub samples are observed. These disappear for scheduled <b>option</b> <b>grants</b> after September 2002, but not for unscheduled <b>option</b> <b>grants.</b> The regression estimates for the periods before and after the introduction of stricter rulings in 2002 are consistent with our findings from the t-tests. The regressions run provide not only evidence that the <b>option</b> <b>grants</b> are timed, but also that the <b>option</b> <b>grants</b> are retroactively backdated. In addition, our findings show that earnings news releases around <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> dates are managed. Our findings are consistent with timing of news being a substitute for backdating <b>option</b> <b>grants</b> and {{the timing of the}} <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> date. Although after September 2002 stricter rulings regarding the <b>option</b> <b>grant</b> date reduce the opportunities to exploit private information, they do not disappear completely, notwithstanding the requirement of immediately publishing the <b>option</b> <b>grants...</b>|$|R
