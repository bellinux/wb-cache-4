5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and <b>tessellated</b> darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E
5|$|Other Roman remains include part of {{the town}} walls and the {{foundations}} of a town house near the county hall. Modern building works within the walls have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street. Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as Dorn pennies, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of <b>tessellated</b> pavement.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, <b>tessellated</b> opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex <b>tessellated,</b> figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the <b>tessellated</b> mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} {{comprises}} an entry hallway and two rooms. The hallways is set with <b>tessellated</b> tiles {{and still has}} the original desk for the visitor's book. Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, <b>tessellated</b> darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
5|$|The Agni's Philosophy tech demo {{was running}} at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with {{approximately}} 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. The entire {{city in the}} demo was <b>tessellated.</b> There is a scene where 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with the Luminous Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC pebble mosaics of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex <b>tessellated</b> mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. <b>Tessellated</b> pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a <b>tessellated</b> chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern <b>tessellated</b> darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.|$|E

25|$|Halysidota tessellaris, {{also called}} the banded tussock moth, <b>tessellated</b> halisidota, and pale tiger moth, is in Erebidae. Like many related species, it has {{chemical}} defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, alkaloids (Weller et al., 1999, Hristov and Conner 2005), at least in adults. Larval brazen behaviours suggest that they are chemically protected; {{they have not been}} analyzed for alkaloid content.|$|E
25|$|In Shamokin Creek at Sunbury, {{there were}} 112 {{individual}} fish from 14 different species. The most common species were smallmouth bass (46 individuals), fallfish (24 individuals), and white suckers (14 individuals). Less common species included pumpkinseeds (six individuals), chain pickerel (five individuals), and spotfin shiners (five individuals). Rarer species included Margined madtom (three individuals) and rock bass and brown bullhead (two individuals each). Only one creek chub, green sunfish, bluegill, <b>tessellated</b> darter, and walleye were observed.|$|E
25|$|Others who {{consider}} the Bimini undersea formation to be man-made, {{as opposed to}} natural beachrock, are Joseph Manson Valentine, zoologist; Charles Berlitz, linguist; Greg Little, psychologist; R. Cedric Leonard, anthropologist; and Dimitri Rebikoff, French marine engineer. All claim to have investigated the formations in person, and claim to have observed more than one horizontal layer of blocks, at least in places. However, multiple layers of block can result naturally from systematic fracturing of sedimentary rock where multiple layers of sedimentary rock lie on top of each, as {{can be observed in}} the case of the <b>tessellated</b> pavement of Tasmania exposed at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent crazing as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure. The thin, delicate sheets in which ammolite occurs are also problematic; for these reasons, most material is impregnated with a clear epoxy or other synthetic resin to stabilize the flake-prone ammolite prior to cutting. Although the <b>tessellated</b> cracking cannot be repaired, the epoxy prevents further flaking and helps protect the relatively soft surface from scratching. The impregnation process was developed {{over a number of}} years by Korite in partnership with the Alberta Research Council. Impregnated and epoxy-coated ammolite first entered the market in 1989 and the treatment significantly increased the availability and durability of the gem.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{was able}} to {{disseminate}} his theories on pattern and ornament through his work for several of the key manufacturers of the period, thus facilitating public consumption of his decorative visions {{in a number of}} diverse contexts. During the 1840s, having been inspired by the tilework at the Alhambra, Jones became known for his designs for mosaics and <b>tessellated</b> pavements, working for firms such as Maw & Co., Blashfield and Minton. He designed wallpapers for several firms from the 1840s until the 1870s including Townsend and Parker, Trumble & Sons and Jeffrey & Co. Jones was also prolific in the field of textiles – designing silks for Warner, Sillett & Ramm and carpets for Brinton and James Templeton & Co. Jones also immersed himself in a number of decorative schemes for domestic interiors, most notably working in collaboration with the London firm Jackson & Graham to produce furniture and other fittings.|$|E
25|$|Triangles are sturdy; while a {{rectangle}} can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure {{to one of}} its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, {{each of the three}} sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It {{is important to remember that}} triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). <b>Tessellated</b> triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.|$|E
500|$|Small {{nucleic acid}} {{complexes}} can {{be equipped with}} sticky ends and combined into larger two-dimensional periodic lattices containing a specific <b>tessellated</b> pattern of the individual molecular tiles. [...] The earliest example of this used double-crossover (DX) complexes as the basic tiles, each containing four sticky ends designed with sequences that caused the DX units to combine into periodic two-dimensional flat sheets that are essentially rigid two-dimensional crystals of DNA. [...] Two-dimensional arrays have been made from other motifs as well, including the Holliday junction rhombus lattice, and various DX-based arrays making use of a double-cohesion scheme. [...] The top two images at right show examples of tile-based periodic lattices.|$|E

500|$|After his 1936 {{journey to}} the Alhambra and to La Mezquita, Cordoba, where he sketched the [...] Moorish {{architecture}} and the <b>tessellated</b> mosaic decorations, Escher began to explore the properties and possibilities of tessellation using geometric grids {{as the basis for}} his sketches. He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs, for example with animals such as birds, fish, and reptiles. One of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil, India ink and watercolour Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles (1939), constructed on a hexagonal grid. The heads of the red, green and white reptiles meet at a vertex; the tails, legs and sides of the animals exactly interlock. It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph Reptiles.|$|E

High treble notes flicker like moths around the top register. Happy singalong music." [...] In his 1998 book The Beatles Diary, Miles praised it further as [...] "the most striking piece of psychedelia The Beatles ever recorded" [...] and concluded: [...] "Discordant, off-beat and effortlessly brilliant, the song was (alongside 'Taxman') Harrison's finest piece of Western rock music to date." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{site was}} again {{excavated}} between 1938 and 1948. It {{may have been}} first settled in the 1st century, but the first stone structure was not erected until a hundred years later. The site developed slowly and, it has been suggested, was even abandoned for a while during the 3rd century. By the 4th century, there was an L-shaped villa with a large, aisled building possibly for farm workers {{and a number of}} smaller agricultural structures almost enclosing a central courtyard. [...] The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has associated collection records of the site, including drawings of other remains such as statues and <b>tessellated</b> pavement, as well as documentation of a 1971 excavation. An early-medieval-period cemetery is in evidence. as are earthworks, traces of walling, a bank and a ditch. Pieces of pottery have been found.|$|E
500|$|Ruth Westgate {{writes that}} Delos {{contains}} {{roughly half of}} all surviving <b>tessellated</b> Greek mosaics from the Hellenistic period. In her estimation the sites of Delos and Morgantina and Soluntum in Sicily contain the largest amount of surviving evidence for Hellenistic Greek mosaics. Hariclia Brecoulaki asserts that the Delos mosaics represent the single largest collection of Greek mosaics. She also states that only the Macedonian capital of Pella ranks as an equal in having private homes (as opposed to royal residences) decorated with elaborate wall paintings, signed mosaics, and freestanding marble sculptures. Katherine M. D. Dunbabin writes that while many Hellenistic mosaics {{have been found in}} mainland Greece, Asia Minor, and northeast Africa (i.e. Cyrene), it is only at the site of Delos where they occur in [...] "sufficient numbers to allow general conclusions about their use and nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} in a special-edition issue of Mojo magazine, Peter Doggett writes that [...] "The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine". Beat Instrumental bemoaned {{the paucity of}} new {{material}} by the band, but added: [...] "be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film is really very nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [...] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track." [...] In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score [...] "superbly produced" [...] and, of the songs, wrote only of [...] "It's All Too Much", which he described as, variously, [...] "Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, <b>tessellated,</b> filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling" [...] and [...] "Happy singalong music". Writing in their book [...] (1975), NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations {{that resulted in a}} full soundtrack album, saying that the four new songs [...] "would have made a superb EP".|$|E
500|$|A {{large part}} of the surface area of the world's deserts {{consists}} of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In [...] "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles, leaving a desert pavement, an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a <b>tessellated</b> mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate. In time, bacteria that live {{on the surface of the}} stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles, forming a shiny brown coating known as desert varnish.|$|E
500|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a thin cuticle, an epidermis consisting of a single layer of cells, a thick dermis formed of connective tissue and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer, which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature. The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate components known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures composed of calcite microcrystals arranged in a lattice. They vary in form, with some bearing external granules, tubercles and spines, but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a <b>tessellated</b> manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface. [...] Some are specialised structures such as the madreporite (the entrance to the water vascular system), pedicellariae and paxillae. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on flexible stalks in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements. They often form clusters surrounding spines. Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment. The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected. All the ossicles, including those projecting externally, are covered by the epidermal layer.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary aesthetic of late antiquity has a <b>tessellated</b> quality that {{has been compared to}} the mosaics characteristic of the period. A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius, Prudentius, Claudian, and Sidonius. Ausonius (d. ca. 394), the Bordelaise tutor of the emperor Gratian, was at least nominally a Christian, though throughout his occasionally obscene mixed-genre poems, he retains a literary interest in the Greco-Roman gods and even druidism. The imperial panegyrist Claudian (d. 404) was a vir illustris who appears never to have converted. Prudentius (d. ca. 413), born in Hispania Tarraconensis and a fervent Christian, was thoroughly versed in the poets of the Classical tradition, and transforms their vision of poetry as a monument of immortality into an expression of the poet's quest for eternal life culminating in Christian salvation. Sidonius (d. 486), a native of Lugdunum, was a Roman senator and bishop of Clermont who cultivated a traditional villa lifestyle as he watched the Western empire succumb to barbarian incursions. His poetry and collected letters offer a unique view of life in late Roman Gaul {{from the perspective of a}} man who [...] "survived the end of his world".|$|E
