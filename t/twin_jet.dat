All of these factors in addition to the ability of producing high velocity pulsed jet led to more appropriate design for a comprehensive study of multijet impingement heat transfer problems. The performance of PTJM was verified by measuring the pulse profile at frequency of 20 [*]Hz, where equal velocity peak of around 64 [*]m/s for both jets was obtained. Moreover, the jet velocity profile at different pulsation frequencies was tested to verify system performance, so the results revealed reasonable velocity profile configuration.

2500|$|Although Braniff {{had been}} one of the first U.S. {{operators}} of the British-built BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the British Aircraft Corporation <b>twin</b> <b>jet),</b> in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight loading door located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger Combi aircraft configuration if needed and Braniff did operate [...] "red eye" [...] overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the rear coach compartment of the jetliner.|$|E
2500|$|By 1968, Braniff International had {{introduced}} jet service into the airport with Boeing 727-100 and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets. At this time, Braniff was operating nonstop 727 flights to Denver and also direct to Dallas Love Field (DAL) via {{a stop in}} Lubbock in addition to flying daily nonstops to DAL with the BAC One-Eleven <b>twin</b> <b>jet</b> and also operating a daily BAC One-Eleven service on a routing of Amarillo - Oklahoma City - Tulsa - Fort Smith, AR - Little Rock - Memphis.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{have been}} performed in this study to visualize the flow behavior of single and multiple square jets issuing normally into a cross-flow. Three configurations are considered, a single jet located in {{the centre of the}} domain, <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> in side-by-side (SBS) arrangement in the spanwise direction and triple jets in tandem arrangement with <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> at the front and a third jet in downstream along the centre line. Simulation uses a jet to cross-flow velocity ratio of 2. 5 and the Reynolds number 225, based on the free-stream quantities and the jet width. While the vortical structures predicted from single jet case were in good qualitatively agreement with the findings of other researchers, our results show that the process of merging between two counter-rotating vortex pairs (CRVP) in <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> configurations is strongly dependent on the jet-to-jet edge distance. Further downstream in the far-field, results from the SBS <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> show a most dominating larger CRVP accompanied with a smaller inner vortex pair. The observations are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings in the literature. The resulting flow structures of triple jets in tandem configuration have revealed, for the first time, more complicated flow interactions between individual jets and cross-flow, providing further insights of complex flow physics and its potential engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ─ Supersonic flows {{associated}} with missiles, aircraft, missile engine intake and rocket nozzles are often steady. The {{shape of the}} nozzle geometry is increasingly attractive in heating, ventilation and air conditioning applications. The objective of the present work is to simulate and understand Supersonic flows with <b>twin</b> free <b>jet</b> Flow at various Mach numbers. The purpose is to precisely understand the fluid dynamics and variation of flow properties such as velocity, pressure and turbulence in supersonic flow regime for various Mach numbers (1. 74, 2, and 3), pressure ratio and dimensionless spacing (B) between two <b>jets.</b> <b>Twin</b> <b>jets</b> flow, generated by two identical parallel axisymmetric nozzles, has been numerically investigated by FLUENT software. The Mach number at the nozzle exit is observed to be less in comparison with designed value. This {{is due to the}} viscosity and turbulence in fluid near the wall of the duct. The Mach number decreases due to shock wave and reversible flow. The results show that the <b>twin</b> <b>jets</b> attract each other. The jet flow field and the merging process of two jets vary with dimension less spacing between two jets. The width of the <b>twin</b> <b>jet’s</b> flow spreads linearly downstream and grows with dimension less spacing. The merging between two jets occurs at the location closer to the nozzle exit for the cases with smaller spacing between nozzles...|$|R
