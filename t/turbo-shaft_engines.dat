40|$|The turbo-shaft {{engine is}} an {{important}} propulsion system used to power vehicles on land, sea, and in the air. As the power plant for many high performance helicopters, {{the characteristics of the}} engine and control are critical to proper vehicle operation as well as being the main determinant to overall vehicle performance. When applied to vertical flight, important distinctions exist in the turbo-shaft engine control system due to the high degree of dynamic coupling between the engine and airframe and the affect on vehicle handling characteristics. In this study, the impact of engine control system architecture is explored relative to engine performance, weight, reliability, safety, and overall cost. Comparison of the impact of architecture on these metrics is investigated as the control system is modified from a legacy centralized structure to a more distributed configuration. A composite strawman system which is typical of <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engines</b> in the 1000 to 2000 hp class is described and used for comparison. The overall benefits of these changes to control system architecture are assessed. The availability of supporting technologies to achieve this evolution is also discussed...|$|E

One key aspect of Si 3 N 4 utilization in such applications is its joining response to diverse materials. In an ongoing research program, the joining and integration of Si 3 N 4 ceramics with metallic, ceramic, and composite materials using braze interlayers with the liquidus temperature in the range 750 - 1240 C is being explored.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{establish}} an adaptive <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> model with high accuracy, a new modeling method based on parameter selection (PS) algorithm and multi-input multi-output recursive reduced least square support vector regression (MRR-LSSVR) machine is proposed. Firstly, the PS algorithm is designed to choose the most reasonable inputs of the adaptive module. During this process, a wrapper criterion based on least square support vector regression (LSSVR) machine is adopted, which can not only reduce computational complexity but also enhance generalization performance. Secondly, with the input variables determined by the PS algorithm, a mapping model of engine parameter estimation is trained off-line using MRR-LSSVR, which has a satisfying accuracy within 5 ‰. Finally, based on a numerical simulation platform of an integrated helicopter/turbo-shaft engine system, an adaptive <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> model is developed and tested in a certain flight envelope. Under the condition of single or multiple engine components being degraded, many simulation experiments are carried out, and the simulation results show the effectiveness {{and validity of the}} proposed adaptive modeling method...|$|R
40|$|Combining a {{simplified}} on-board turbo-shaft model with sensor fault diagnostic logic, a model-based sensor fault diagnosis method is proposed. The existing fault diagnosis method for <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> key sensors is mainly {{based on a}} double redundancies technique, and this can’t be satisfied in some occasions as lack of judgment. The simplified on-board model provides the analytical third channel against which the dual channel measurements are compared, while the hardware redundancy will increase the structure complexity and weight. The simplified turbo-shaft model contains the gas generator model and the power turbine model with loads, this is built up via dynamic parameters method. Sensor fault detection, diagnosis (FDD) logic is designed, and two types of sensor failures, such as the step faults and the drift faults, are simulated. When the discrepancy among the triplex channels exceeds a tolerance level, the fault diagnosis logic determines {{the cause of the}} difference. Through this approach, the sensor fault diagnosis system achieves the objectives of anomaly detection, sensor fault diagnosis and redundancy recovery. Finally, experiments on this method are carried out on a <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine,</b> and two types of faults under different channel combinations are presented. The experimental results show that the proposed method for sensor fault diagnostics is efficient...|$|R
40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for the identification, viz., relative magnitude and spatial origin, of broadband and tonal noise sources within aeroengines. The methods require dynamic pressure measurements from sensors {{located within the}} engine. These techniques {{can be used to}} assess the contribution of internal noise sources to sound radiated from an aeroengine exhaust, for example, to the far field. Three coherence based techniques are evaluated: the coherent output power, the signal enhancement technique and a five sensor partial coherence method. The techniques are applied to data generated by a small scale experimental rig within an EU FP 7 programme ? TEENI. The experimental test rig design simulates the most relevant acoustic features of the downstream part of a turbo-shaft engine, i. e. the combustion noise source, the turbine stages and the relevant propagation processes to the exhaust exit. The application of these techniques to <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engines</b> is of particular interest where corenoise is a far more significant contributor to far field sound than jet noise. Results show how broadband noise from a rotor/stator stage, broadband noise from a single loudspeaker (simulating the combustor) and a tone from the rotor/stator stage can all be decomposed from measurements and how these contributions can be localised. In addition, the five sensor method is significantly enhanced to include acoustic modal decomposition. This allows the contribution of sources to individual radial modes to be measured and the source location identified. Specific radial modes were generated and measured with upstream loudspeaker and downstream microphone arrays respectively...|$|E
40|$|In-service {{performance}} {{deterioration of}} gas turbine engines can be identified, at the engine module level, {{in terms of}} reductions in the component mass flow and the efficiency. Continued operation of a deteriorated gas turbine is (i) uneconomical and (ii) unsafe. Timely identification of the faults and ensuing maintenance could prevent both. Gas Path Analysis is a technique to establish the current performance level of the gas turbines and identify the faulty modules. Computer models can predict the off_design performance of gas turbines by aero-thermo-dynamically matching the engine components. This thesis describes the development of DETEM (DEeteriorated Turbine Engine Model), a generalised computer program, developed to model degraded gas turbine engines and analyse faults. The program has an integrated graphics module and creates windows on the VDU terminal,for displaying the program output and accepting the user input. This enables the user to compare the results of {{two different types of}} runs at the same time. The program incorporates sensor models that modify the output, with noise and in bias, based on the sensor characteristics, thus simulating a real engine. It is possible to simulate the engine performance at design point, off-design and under transient conditions. The runs could be for a "clean" and a deteriorated engine. Three techniques, iterative, fault coefficient matrix, and a statistical best-estimation technique, have been used to analyse the engine performance and identify the fault. Analysis of two and three shaft <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engines</b> and two spool turbo-fan and turbo-jet engines have been worked out in the thesis. Effects of reducing the number of measurements and measuring different engine parameters, on the accuracy of the fault identification, have been studied. The program is considered to have a potential for the generation of fault trees for rule-based expert system applied to gas turbine diagnostics. Because of the controlled output to the screen, a direct comparison of two different runs side by side, on the same screen, makes the program a good teaching aid for gas turbine diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft noise {{has been}} a problem near {{airports}} for many years. It is a quality of life issue that impacts {{millions of people around the}} world. Solving this problem has been the principal goal of noise reduction research that began when commercial jet travel became a reality. While progress has been made in reducing both airframe and engine noise, historically, most of the aircraft noise reduction efforts have concentrated on the engines. This was most evident during the 1950 s and 1960 s when turbojet engines were in wide use. This type of engine produces high velocity hot exhaust jets during takeoff generating a great deal of noise. While there are fewer commercial aircraft flying today with turbojet engines, supersonic aircraft including high performance military aircraft use engines with similar exhaust flow characteristics. The Pratt & Whitney F 100 -PW- 229, pictured in Figure la, is an example of an engine that powers the F- 15 and F- 16 fighter jets. The turbofan engine was developed for subsonic transports, which in addition to better fuel efficiency also helped mitigate engine noise by reducing the jet exhaust velocity. These engines were introduced in the late 1960 s and power most of the commercial fleet today. Over the years, the bypass ratio (that is the ratio of the mass flow through the fan bypass duct to the mass flow through the engine core) has increased to values approaching 9 for modern turbofans such as the General Electric s GE- 90 engine (Figure lb). The benefits to noise reduction for high bypass ratio (HPBR) engines are derived from lowering the core jet velocity and temperature, and lowering the tip speed and pressure ratio of the fan, both of which are the consequences of the increase in bypass ratio. The HBPR engines are typically very large in diameter and can produce over 100, 000 pounds of thrust for the largest engines. A third type of engine flying today is the turbo-shaft which is mainly used to power turboprop aircraft and helicopters. An example of this type of engine is shown in Figure IC, which is a schematic of the Honeywell T 55 engine that powers the CH- 47 Chinook helicopter. Since the noise from the propellers or helicopter rotors is usually dominant for <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engines,</b> less attention has been paid to these engines in so far as community noise considerations are concerned. This chapter will concentrate mostly on turbofan engine noise and will highlight common methods for their noise prediction and reduction...|$|E

40|$|In {{computational}} {{engineering design}} the robust analysis comprises a prerequisite towards the successful development of future gas turbines. However, reliable {{determination of the}} statistical characteristics of variation of the operating conditions in a turbomachine is crucial. Initially, the variability of the physical operating conditions along the operating line on the compressor map is developed {{with the assistance of}} a throughflow analysis tool. The probability density functions of the variability of the pressure profiles, mass flow, input angles, etc. of each individual stage of the compressor can be extracted and processed accordingly for 3 D aerodynamic shape robust design. In this way, flexibility in detailed design is developed leading to innovative and creative thinking in modern turbomachinery design, {{but at the same time}} the intelligence and level of robust design is improved, and hence the quality of the designed product. For a particular compression system of a <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> all the details can be extracted, along the whole operating line, covering all the possible scenarios of individual operating conditions of each component. With this methodology the appropriate information is developed for robust analysis at the preliminary or detailed design phases of a compression system...|$|R
40|$|It is {{essential}} to design a propulsion powertrain real-time simulator using the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system that emulates an electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) systems power grid. This simulator would enable us to facilitate in-depth understanding of the system principles, to validate system model analysis and performance prediction, and to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the EAP electrical system. This paper describes how subscale electrical machines with their controllers can mimic the power components in an EAP powertrain. In particular, three powertrain emulations are presented to mimic 1) a gas turbo-=shaft engine driving a generator, consisting of two permanent magnet (PM) motors with brushless motor drives, coupled by a shaft, 2) a motor driving a propulsive fan, and 3) a <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> driven fan (turbofan engine) operation. As a first step towards the demonstration, experimental dynamic characterization of the two motor drive systems, coupled by a mechanical shaft, were performed. The previously developed analytical motor models 1 were then replaced with the experimental motor models to perform the real-time demonstration in the predefined flight path profiles. This technique can convert the plain motor system into a unique EAP power grid emulator that enables rapid analysis and real-time simulation performance using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) ...|$|R

Lately, new researches were carried out by four researchers led by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist, consisting of members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a <b>turbo-shaft</b> turbine <b>engine</b> where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in the same plane.

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} component life prediction {{is crucial to}} ensure both the safety and economics of gas turbine operations. In the pursuit of improved accuracy and reliability, current model-based creep life estimation methods have {{become more and more}} complicated and therefore demand huge amounts of work and significant amounts of computational time. Because of the underlying problems arising from current life estimation methods, this research aims to develop an alternative performance-based creep life estimation method that is able to provide a quick solution to creep life prediction {{while at the same time}} maintaining the achieved accuracy and reliability as that of the model-based method. Using an artificial neural network, the existing creep life prediction subprocesses and secondary inputs are ‘absorbed’ into simple parallel computing units that are able to create direct mapping between various gas turbine operating and health conditions or gas path sensors and creep life. The outcome of this research is the creation of three proposed neural-based creep life prediction architectures known as the Range-Based, Functional-Based and Sensor-Based. An integrated creep life estimation model was first developed and incorporated into an in-house performance simulation and diagnostics software. Using the integrated model, the effects of several operating and health parameters on a selected <b>turbo-shaft</b> <b>engine</b> model turbine blade’s creep life was initially performed using an introduced Creep Factor approach. The outcomes of this investigation were then used to populate input-output samples to train and validate the neural-based creep life prediction architectures. To ensure that the proposed neural architectures are able to achieve generalisation and produce accurate creep life prediction for both clean and degraded engine conditions, four-stage assessments were carried out. Finally, the effects of input uncertainties on the creep life prediction were investigated to assess how sensitive the proposed architectures are to different levels of uncertainty. The results show that all of the proposed neural architectures were able to produce accurate creep life predictions for both clean and degraded engine conditions. When comparing the three proposed architectures, the Sensor-Based architecture was found to be the most accurate in both conditions. Despite the accurate creep life prediction, it was also found that all of the proposed architectures were sensitive to input uncertainties with the Functional-Based architecture being the least sensitive to the uncertainty...|$|R
