25|$|After condemning some of {{the other}} nations of Europe (who in his opinion fail to live up to Christian ideals), the poet tells of the Portuguese fleet {{reaching}} the Indian city of Calicut. A Muslim named Monçaide greets the fleet and tells the explorers about the lands they have reached. The king, Samorin, hears of the newcomers and summons them. A governor and official of the king, called the Catual, leads the Portuguese to the king, who receives them well. The Catual speaks with Monçaide {{to learn more about the}} new arrivals. The Catual then goes to the Portuguese ships himself to confirm what Monsayeed has <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> is treated well.|$|E
25|$|The band first hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, {{formerly}} of Trapeze. According to Ian Paice, Glover had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Lord {{a few months}} before his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had already started to drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece band, with Hughes as both bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was persuaded to join under the guise that the band would be bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company. Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.|$|E
25|$|When it is {{discovered}} that Richie Novak (Billy Miller), recent but former love interest of Babe, needs {{a bone marrow}} transplant, she goes {{on a mission to}} save his life. She secretly discovers that JR is the perfect bone marrow match for him. Aware that the two are enemies, she makes a deal with JR on February 19, 2008 after informing him that he is a bone marrow match for Richie. The deal {{comes in the form of}} strip poker. If Babe wins, JR will save Richie's life. If JR wins, Babe will give JR anything he wants regards to her. The two play the game at Babe's place, where Babe loses. Babe naked, and JR half naked, Babe grabs a robe just as JR surprises her by revealing that he already knew of his bone marrow status before she <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> that he already planned to donate to Richie. He says he cannot let a man die without reason. Babe is touched by JR's words, and the two flirt. They soon embrace and make love, unaware that Richie has also just discovered that JR is a bone marrow match and has sent thugs to capture JR in order to take his bone marrow any way viable.|$|E

25|$|Jaime and Brienne reach King's Landing to {{find that}} Joffrey's younger brother Tommen Baratheon will inherit the throne; Tyrion is on trial; and the Tyrell bannermen blame Brienne for Renly Baratheon's death. Jaime's severed right hand becomes infected, but he is healed by former maester Qyburn, who {{was thrown out of}} the Citadel for {{forbidden}} experiments, earning Qyburn the admiration of Cersei. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, rejects Cersei's advances, and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but refuses his father's offer of Casterly Rock, whereupon Tywin disinherits him. Jaime frees Brienne and gives her a sword reforged from Ice, Ned Stark's sword. He tells her to keep her oath to Catelyn, to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Against Tyrion, Cersei recruits the spymaster Varys and Tyrion's lover, Shae. Tyrion is approached by Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, who offers a trial by combat against Cersei's champion, Gregor Clegane, who he knows was {{responsible for the death of}} his sister Elia. Oberyn nearly emerges victorious, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn's spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is again condemned to death but is freed by Jaime and Varys. Jaime reveals that Tyrion's first wife Tysha, who Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison and forced Tyrion to participate, was not a prostitute as Tywin <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin, and tells Jaime he murdered Joffrey and that Cersei took other lovers while he was Robb Stark's captive. During Tyrion's escape, he strangles Shae and kills Tywin in his privy before fleeing Westeros.|$|E

In London while en route to Los Angeles, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is confronted by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), a desire they seem to have in common. Following Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes's (Jorge Garcia) breakout of a mental institution, he and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious. [...] Meanwhile, Ben and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. They discover that Hurley has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the Oceanic Six.

500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them.

Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight." ...|$|E
500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|The Doors, {{released}} in 1991, received criticism from former Doors member Ray Manzarek (keyboardist–bass player) during {{a question and}} answer session at Indiana University East (in Richmond, Indiana), in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about The Doors and Jim Morrison for over 12 hours. Patricia Kennealy-Morrison—a well known rock critic and author—was a consultant on the movie, in which she also has a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir [...] (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate. [...] The other surviving former members of the band, John Densmore and Robby Krieger, also cooperated with the filming of Doors, but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.|$|E

[...] Parker believed what his father had <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil towards me, and thy regard towards me is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, attitude) gracious towards me as formerly"; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything that she <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods.

2500|$|Hope {{refuses to}} let Jennifer help {{her as she}} is {{determined}} {{to pay for her}} crimes. The women's prison that Hope is staying at, however, is trafficking human organs that came from dead inmates, and the doctor that Jennifer had been seeing at the time is helping Warden Jane and the DiMera family. After Bo helps Hope escape for the jail after being nearly beaten to death, Jennifer uses her journalism background to get a job at the prison to try and save Hope and expose the illegal scam at the prison. Warden Jane and Lee, however, discover Jennifer's true motives, and removes Jennifer's heart from her body with the intention of giving it to Dr. Walters to save a patient at the hospital. Melanie Layton and Dr. Daniel Jonas are informed of Jennifer's condition and rush to save her. Daniel ends up putting Jennifer's heart back into her chest and saves her life. This begins a flirtatious relationship between the two. Meanwhile, Jennifer's daughter Abigial, returns home to Salem to be with her mother. Without hearing a word from her husband Jack, Jennifer decides it is best if she divorces Jack and moves on with her life. After the divorce is finalized and after flirting for months, Jennifer and Daniel began to date, much to the dismay of Jennifer and Daniel's good friend, Dr. Carly Manning. In July 2011, Jennifer discovered that Carly had been using drugs and had become addicted due to her life falling apart and Jennifer being with Daniel, the man she feels she wants to love. Jennifer and Daniel end up getting Carly medical help. Carly, along with her son, Nicholas, leave Salem to go to Europe. As Jennifer and Daniel fall deeper in love, Jack unexpectedly returns to Salem. Although Jennifer and Abby are upset at his absence, he reveals that he was held prisoner in Afghanistan while covering the opium trade there, and that a British friend he had there was killed, giving him PTSD. Wanting to support him, Jennifer gets closer to Jack, and the two realize that they still love each other. Unable to make a choice between Daniel and Jack, Daniel breaks up with Jennifer and leaves Salem. Jennifer helps Abe with his campaign for mayor, though they lose to EJ DiMera. Jennifer eventually wins Jack's heart, and the two get engaged. When Daniel returns, Jennifer asks him if they can be friends, and he tells her they can, while he begins a secret romance with Nicole Walker. When the tunnels explode underneath Salem, Jack saves Abby from being trapped in a broken elevator. The elevator, with Jack inside, plunges several stories, causing Jack to die. Distraught, Abby and Jennifer scatter his ashes off the shores of northern California. Broken, Jennifer allows a pregnant Nicole to live with her, in order to keep Daniel happy and so that Victor Kiriakis doesn't have to let her live with him. Nicole reveals her relationship with Daniel, which makes Jennifer uneasy and argumentative with Nicole. Jennifer tells Nicole that she must leave after she gives birth. After Nicole sees a close moment between Daniel and Jennifer and later loses her baby, she gets in a fight with Jennifer, ending with Nicole falling down some stairs and [...] "miscarrying." [...] Nicole blames Jennifer for the fall, but the truth is revealed that Nicole knew her baby died but was keeping it a secret so that Daniel would take her to Hawaii. Knowing that Daniel will love Jennifer and will never love Nicole, Nicole apologizes for her wrongdoings and leaves the duo alone. Daniel agrees to still be her friend, and he and Jennifer forgive her, not pressing charges. Daniel saves Jennifer's life after, admitting that he loves her, by removing her appendix before it bursts, with Nicole's help. Jennifer admits to Daniel, while the surgery goes on, that she loves him. She forgets afterwards, however, but is glad that Daniel's hand tremors are gone thanks to the treatment she found for him. Later, she remembers what she <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and,</b> with Abby, says goodbye to her old life with Jack. Daniel and Jennifer reunite with nearly everyone's blessing, but Jennifer's half brother, Lucas Horton, doesn't approve of the reunion due to his bitter past with Daniel. On New Year's Eve, Daniel and Jennifer share a kiss and spend the night together.|$|E
