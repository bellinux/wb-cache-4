40|$|Providing a <b>trustworthy</b> mobile <b>computing</b> {{platform}} {{is crucial for}} mobile communications, services and applications. In this dissertation, we study methodologies and mechanisms {{that can be used}} to provide a <b>trustworthy</b> mobile <b>computing</b> platform. We also present an autonomic trust management solution for a component software middleware platform targeting at an embedded device, such as a mobile phone. In the first part of the dissertation, we firstly overview the literature background of trust modeling and trust management. We propose research methodologies on the basis of a conceptual architecture of a trusted mobile environment. Further, we present a methodology to bridge disjoint trusted domains in mobile computing and communications into a trustworthy system. The second part of the dissertation contains a mechanism to sustain trust among computing platforms. The mechanism builds up a trust relationship based on the Root Trust (RT) module at a trustee platform and ensures trust sustainability according to pre-defined conditions. These conditions are approved at the time of trust establishment and enforced through the use of the pre-attested RT module until the intended purpose is fulfilled. Through applying this mechanism, we introduce a Trusted Collaboration Infrastructure (TCI) for peer-to-peer devices in order to establish trust collaboration among distributed peers. In addition, this mechanism contributes to a mobile Virtual Private Networ...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of complex}} {{hardware}} {{makes it difficult}} for current timing analysis techniques to <b>compute</b> <b>trustworthy</b> and tight worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds. Those techniques require detailed knowledge of the internal operation and state of the platform, at both the software and hardware level. Obtaining that information for modern hardware platforms is increasingly difficult. Measurement-Based Probabilistic Timing Analysis (MBPTA) reduces the cost of acquiring the knowledge needed for <b>computing</b> <b>trustworthy</b> and tight WCET bounds. MBPTA based on Extreme Value Theory requires the execution time of processor instructions to be independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.), which can be achieved with some hardware support. Previous proposals show how those properties can be achieved for caches. This paper considers, for the first time, the implications on MBPTA of using buffer resources. Buffers in general, and firstcome first-served (FCFS) buffers in particular, are of paramount importance as the complexity of hardware increases, since they allow managing contention in those resources where multiple requests may be pending.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{architecture}} for a cloud-based Integrity Measurement Service (cIMS). The cIMS performs {{the evaluation of the}} integrity measurements received about the client, and issues a trust score reflecting its evaluation against one or more predetermined profiles for client measurements. We use the classic SAML 2.0 ecosystem[5] as a means to illustrate usage of the cIMS. In this model, a client seeking access to a Service Provider (SP) must first be authenticated by an Identity Provider (IdP), who issues SAML assertions pertaining to the client. Here we extend the SAML 2.0 model by having the IdP request also from the client an integrity measurement report. In order to satisfy the need for a high LOA level, we propose the use of a <b>trustworthy</b> portable <b>computing</b> platform, the Trust Extension Device (TED) to provide the client-side trusted computing environment capable of performing integrity measurements of the client-side components.|$|R

Following on from the introduction, the book {{is divided into three}} parts: Cloud management, Cloud security, and practical examples. Part one presents the main components constituting the Cloud and federated Cloud infrastructure(e. g., interactions and deployment), discusses management platforms (resources and services), identifies and analyzes the main properties of the Cloud infrastructure, and presents Cloud automated management services: virtual and application resource management services. Part two analyzes the problem of establishing trustworthy Cloud, discusses foundation frameworks for addressing this problem- focusing on mechanisms for treating the security challenges, discusses foundation frameworks and mechanisms for remote attestation in Cloud and establishing Cloud trust anchors, and lastly provides a framework for establishing a trustworthy provenance system and describes its importance in addressing major security challenges such as forensic investigation, mitigating insider threats and operation management assurance. Finally, part three, based on practical examples, presents real-life commercial and open source examples of some of the concepts discussed, and includes a real-life case study to reinforce learning - especially focusing on Cloud security.

This {{is caused by a}} lack of guarantees about what is happening on the server side. As a worst case scenario, the service might be subjected to an insider attack. This dissertation describes the unalterable secure service concept for <b>trustworthy</b> cloud <b>computing.</b> Secure services are a powerful abstraction that enables viewing the cloud as a true extension of local computing resources. Secure services combine the security benefits one gets locally with the manageability and availability of the distributed cloud. Secure services are implemented using secure enclaves. Remote attestation of the server is used to obtain guarantees about the programming of the service. This dissertation addresses concerns related to using secure enclaves such as providing data freshness and distributing identity information. Certificate Transparency is augmented to distribute information about which services exist and what they do.

40|$|Abstract—Creating <b>trustworthy</b> online <b>computing</b> is an {{important}} open issue in security research. Trusted Comput-ing aims {{to address this problem}} through the use of remote attestation but comes with its own baggage in the form of privacy concerns. Federated Identity Management Systems (FIDMSs), on the other hand, provide another form of trust but lack the ability to measure the integrity of platforms that they vouch for. We note that these two security architectures have reciprocal strengths and weaknesses and can be combined to create an architecture that addresses the concerns of both. In this paper, we propose an extended FIDMS in which the identity provider not only vouches for the identity of a user but also for her platform’s integrity. In this way, we (a) allow a service provider to establish trust on a client platform’s integrity without sacrificing privacy; and (b) create a feasible and scalable architecture for remote attestation. We describe our proposed architecture in the context of Shibboleth FIDMS and provide the details of the implementation of this system. I...|$|R
