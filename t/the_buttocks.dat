5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buttock</b> {{augmentation}} increases <b>the</b> {{size and}} prominence of <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> muscles. This look it created using either the grafting of fat, implants or both, {{to boost the}} appearance of the muscles. This fills <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> giving it a rounded smooth appearance and is also said to help improve posture and balance.|$|R
30|$|We {{present a}} case of psoas abscess, the initial {{clinical}} presentation of which was painful swelling of <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> with local erythema {{and a sense of}} heat. Recognition of the psoas abscess as well as the apparent manifestation and evacuation of the whole lesion via combined anterior retroperitoneal approach and direct incision over <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> led to complete eradication of the pathology.|$|R

5|$|Hair {{length is}} most often {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) from {{the line of the}} scalp on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to the part of the body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder length, lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet <b>the</b> <b>buttocks),</b> thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond <b>the</b> <b>buttocks,</b> is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E

40|$|A {{significantly}} diminished antibody {{response to}} hepatitis B vaccine {{has been demonstrated}} in adults when <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> is used as the injection site. However, in Brazil, <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> continues to be recommended as site of injection for intramuscular administration of vaccines in infants. In this age group, there are no controlled studies evaluating the immunogenicity of the hepatitis B vaccine when administered at this site. In the present study, 258 infants were randomized to receive the hepatitis B vaccine either in <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> (n = 123) or in the anterolateral thigh muscle (n = 135). The immunization schedule consisted of three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B Ã¢, 10 mug) at 2, 4 and 9 months of age. There {{were no significant differences}} in the proportion of seroconversion (99. 3 % x 99. 2 %), or in the geometric mean titer of ELISA anti-HBs (1, 862. 1 x 1, 229. 0 mIU/mL) between the two groups. This study demonstrates that a satisfactory serological response can be obtained when the hepatitis B vaccine is administered intramuscularly into <b>the</b> <b>buttock...</b>|$|R

25|$|Men {{are more}} likely to have fat stored in the abdomen due to sex hormone differences. Female sex hormone causes fat to be stored in <b>the</b> <b>buttocks,</b> thighs, and hips in women. When women reach {{menopause}} and the estrogen produced by the ovaries declines, fat migrates from <b>the</b> <b>buttocks,</b> hips and thighs to the waist; later fat is stored in the abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1944, Compton {{was shot}} through <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> while {{participating}} in Operation Market Garden, the Allies' ill-fated attempt to seize {{a number of}} bridges in the Netherlands and cross the Rhine River into Germany. The bullet traveled sideways, through one side of <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> {{and out the other}} side. After a partial recovery, he returned to E Company in time for the siege in the frozen Ardennes that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. In January 1945, Compton left E Company for another assignment.|$|E

40|$|Extraskeletal mesenchymal {{chondrosarcoma}} is rare and metastasis to the pancreas is extremely rare, with only four cases {{reported in the}} literature. The therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy remains uncertain. We report a 39 -year-old man with extraskeletal {{mesenchymal chondrosarcoma}} of <b>the</b> <b>buttock,</b> who had metastases to the pancreas, bones, and lung. He underwent distal pancreatectomy, resection of <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> tumor, and chemotherapy. He had a good response to chemotherapy and survived for about 3 years after surgery...|$|R
50|$|For correct spinal {{alignment}} it {{is necessary}} that both buttocks be in contact with the floor. If the twisting causes one to tilt onto <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> on <b>the</b> tilting side, a folded mat should be placed under <b>the</b> other <b>buttock</b> to allow one to relax with both <b>buttocks</b> on <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
25|$|Involvement of {{the spinal}} cord is rare, but can lead to {{abnormal}} sensation or weakness {{in one or more}} limbs, or cauda equina symptoms (incontinence to urine or stool, decreased sensation in <b>the</b> <b>buttocks).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between <b>the</b> <b>buttocks.</b> Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of <b>the</b> <b>buttocks,</b> but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E
25|$|The septocutaneous {{perforator}} is {{not always}} present; the requirement to rotate the patient during the surgery; {{the possibility of a}} donor-site contour deformity high upon <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> area; and an asymmetrical buttocks region {{in the case of a}} unilateral breast reconstruction.|$|E

40|$|Deposition of amyloid in <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of dialysis related amyloidosis (DRA), but this localization is even rarer in other types of amyloidoses. We report here the clinical, radiological, and biochemical features of a patient who incurred into this complication after 27 years of hemodialysis. Imaging of the amyloid deposition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documents the amyloid infiltration in the muscles of <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> region and highlights a peculiar feature of amyloid fibrils deposition in the subcutaneous fat. The amyloid deposition is confirmed by biochemical and microscopic analysis of fibrils extracted from a biopsy specimen. Review of literature and the features of this case lead to speculation that the peculiar involvement of <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> region including muscles and subcutaneous fat in DRA might derive from the propagation of amyloid initially deposited in the hip joint...|$|R

25|$|A {{breech birth}} is {{the birth of}} a baby from a breech presentation, in which the baby exits the pelvis with <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> or feet first as opposed to the normal head-first presentation. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.|$|E
25|$|Full {{squatting}} involves resting one's {{weight on}} the feet with <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> resting {{on the backs of}} the calves. It may be used as a posture for resting or working at ground level particularly where the ground is too dirty or wet to sit or kneel.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates <b>the</b> <b>buttocks</b> to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates <b>the</b> <b>buttocks,</b> retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E

40|$|A 75 -year-old male {{had failed}} to respond {{conservative}} therapy for erectile dysfunction and had undergone insertion of a malleable penile prosthesis in 1995. Twenty years after the initial implant he presented with right-sided prosthesis localized in <b>the</b> <b>buttock.</b> There was no infection. The prosthesis was extracted through an incision in the right hip. As in the recent case, mechanical failures in malleable penile prosthesis models, can occur. Penile implant migration back to <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> without a curve deformity is an extremely rare complication. Clinicians should be alert about possible late complications of penile prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumor with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, malignant triton tumor, has a rare incidence. We report {{such a case}} in a 40 -year-old male who presented with a mass over <b>the</b> <b>buttock.</b> He was a previously diagnosed case of neurofibroma in the same area. Histomorphology supported by immunostaining with S- 100 protein confirmed the diagnosis. Malignant triton tumor has a poor prognosis owing to its aggressive biological behavior. The fact {{that the presence of}} this tumor in <b>the</b> <b>buttock</b> region is extremely rare has prompted the authors to report this case...|$|R
