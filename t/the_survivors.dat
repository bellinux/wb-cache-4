5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to hand over all their personal belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> in painful positions which caused them to have difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the Geneva Convention. However, the female survivors later had their ropes removed. When <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|E
5|$|Armero {{was never}} rebuilt after the tragedy. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> were {{relocated}} to {{the towns of}} Guayabal and Lérida, rendering Armero a ghost town.|$|E
5|$|As White had {{expected}} <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> {{eventually}} gathers Sanchez, Carol, and Emily by the repaired seaplane. Sanchez {{wants to}} leave at once, but <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> insists they fetch Ramon as well. However, not far from <b>the</b> plane <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is instead confronted by Kovac, who shows his true colors, claiming {{he does not want}} <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> to leave as they have 'not finished their training'. He then sets <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> a 'final exam' by attracting a massive zombie horde, which will have to be fought off while the plane starts up. Finally, after a grueling battle, <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> manages to escape back to the plane, and it takes off with Kovac calling through a loudspeaker for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> to 'come back'.|$|R
50|$|It will be {{seen that}} the effect of massing, if carried out, is to give <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> one benefit and to deprive him or her of another. <b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> acquires a {{beneficial}} interest in the property of the first-dying which otherwise (in the absence of any will) <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> would not have obtained, but <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> no longer has the full ownership {{of his or her own}} share of the property which otherwise he or she would have retained. <b>The</b> <b>survivor,</b> however, is not bound to allow the mutual will to be carried into effect. If <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> accepts <b>the</b> benefit, he or she must also accept the loss of an interest in his or her own property; <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> cannot accept <b>the</b> benefit without its accompanying liability. It follows that <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> has a choice or election whether to abide by the terms of the mutual will or to repudiate them.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> elects {{to abide}} by the will, or “adiates,” <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> can be {{relieved}} of the consequences of such action if <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> acted under a reasonable and excusable ignorance of his or her legal rights, but not if <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> erroneously thought that adiation would be of greater benefit than it turned out to be. If, after adiation, a new will is discovered which adds to or alters the provisions of the earlier will, <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> has a further opportunity to adiate or repudiate.|$|R
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for <b>the</b> <b>survivors,</b> Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E

5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to the {{helicopter}} so they can leave, but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is finally killed protecting Alice from an explosion, and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> seize the helicopter. They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E

50|$|Whether <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> has {{elected to}} abide by the terms of the mutual will or to {{repudiate}} them is a question of fact. The election is generally effected by <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> in his or her capacity as executor (for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is usually appointed executor testamentary) in framing the liquidation and distribution account. If <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> takes <b>the</b> interest in the share of the first-dying in terms of the mutual will <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is deemed to have accepted the benefits and to have adiated. Vice versa, <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is held to repudiate the terms of the will if he or she does not take the interest in the share of the first-dying but assigns the estate of the deceased to the other beneficiaries.|$|R
50|$|Since estate massing {{places a}} burden on <b>the</b> <b>survivor,</b> <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} of election comes into play. <b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> has to adiate or repudiate the massing before there can be any legal consequences.|$|R
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned <b>the</b> <b>survivors,</b> gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> of Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

50|$|Massing is a {{disposition}} by the testators in {{a mutual}} will of their joined property or of {{a portion of}} it in favour of <b>the</b> <b>survivor,</b> giving him or her a limited interest in the joined property, and providing that {{on his or her}} death such property is to go to some other person or persons. The limited interest conferred on <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is, as a rule, either a usufructuary or a fiduciary interest. For example, the testators leave “all property belonging to us to our children, subject to a usufruct in favour of the survivor;” in this case <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> acquires a usufructuary interest in the massed property. Or, again, the testators may leave “our joint estate to <b>the</b> <b>survivor,</b> and after <b>the</b> death of <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> to our children;” in this case <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> acquires a fiduciary interest.|$|R
50|$|Sufferers {{sometimes}} blame {{themselves for}} the deaths of others, including those who died while rescuing <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> or whom <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> tried unsuccessfully to save.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the results of}} {{research}} undertaken to explore the experience of therapy by respectively <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of armed robbery and the therapist of <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of armed robbery in the case where therapy is prematurely terminated by <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of armed robbery are discussed. A high percentage of therapy for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of armed robbery is being terminated prematurely by <b>the</b> <b>survivor.</b> This might be the reason for failing to use all possible opportunities to recover within reasonable time. The research questions that arouse are: “How do survivors of armed robbery experience therapy after being exposed to armed robbery?” and “How do therapists experience therapy for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> of armed robbery?” A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was utilised. Phenomenological, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} survivors of armed robbery and therapists of survivors of armed robbery to explore and describe their experiences...|$|R

50|$|The term “massing” {{will first}} be explained, then <b>the</b> <b>survivor’s</b> {{election}} will be discussed, and thereafter effect of <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> repudiating or accepting benefits respectively will be considered.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> accepts <b>the</b> {{benefits}} {{under the}} mutual will {{he or she}} becomes bound by its terms. <b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> is consequently under an obligation (of a contractual or quasi-contractual nature) to allow the jointly disposed of property to devolve {{in terms of the}} joint will. In other words, the mutual will now comes fully into operation and <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> cannot revoke his or her share of it. The mutual will operates in effect as the will of the first-dying party and <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> is a beneficiary under that will.|$|R
5|$|Season three {{continues}} the story 67 {{days after the}} crash. The season begins where the second season left off: three of the crash survivors are held in captivity by the mysterious Others. More backstory on the Others, {{as well as the}} Dharma Initiative, is revealed. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> face continuous threats from their enemies, and also from their friends. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> attempt to make contact with a freighter which they believe is there to rescue them. Season three takes place over 24 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was written {{off after the}} accident. Immediately after the accident, Widerøe paid a compensation of NOK10,000 to each of <b>the</b> <b>survivors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> and the deceased's next-of-kin claimed damages for several million NOK, including three people who each demanded over one million after becoming disabled. The demands were raised against the insurance company Norsk Flyforsikringspool. After mediation, the airline agreed to compensate the passengers with an additional NOK15,000 in cash and NOK30,000 worth of free travel with Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|The {{party of}} Behar {{survivors}} {{who had been}} landed at Tanjung Priok were initially interred in prisoner of war camps in Java; the male prisoners were sent to a camp near Batavia and the women were held in a female camp nearby.

50|$|Speedle {{looks into}} the victim's life, Calleigh looks for the bullet, and Eric tries {{to find out how}} the plane crashed. Speedle concludes that the victim did not commit suicide, Calleigh discovers a rivet, not a bullet, had hit the pilot, and Eric finds a very {{expensive}} woman's shoe in the plane's engine. They recreate the scene again but cannot prove <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> killed <b>the</b> woman. Horatio remembers the marks on the woman's hand and links them to a fire extinguisher <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> used to break the woman's grip on <b>the</b> door. <b>The</b> <b>survivor</b> killed <b>the</b> woman because she was a whistleblower to the fraud the company committed. They find <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> at his house after he hangs himself. Horatio gives the victim's mother a damaging letter her daughter wrote about <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> and <b>the</b> others from the crash.|$|R

5|$|To {{break contact}} with the Viet Cong units which fired on Alpha Company from the western flank, First Sergeant Jose Valdez quickly {{organized}} an assembly area {{on the eastern side}} to round up <b>the</b> <b>survivors.</b> Shortly after the assembly area was established George, who was severely wounded from the Claymore explosion, turned his company over to Valdez. Allen then ordered Valdez to lead <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> of Alpha Company northward to join the rest of the battalion. <b>The</b> <b>survivors,</b> mostly from the 2nd and 3rd Platoons of Alpha Company, were then ordered to withdraw through a perimeter formed by Delta Company. As the surviving elements of Alpha Company pulled back, Delta Company began to receive sporadic fire from their southern flank, so Allen ordered his command group to remain in place near a prominent anthill with the 1st and 2nd Platoons of Delta Company. The 3rd Platoon, on the other hand, was instructed to move forward to assist the wounded men from Alpha Company.|$|E
5|$|To replace these officers, Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company {{was ordered}} forward to gather <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> and withdraw, forming up at a {{barricade}} {{on the edge}} of the Hollow. Innes regrouped <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> and, following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire, assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10:15. Weighed down with entrenching equipment, the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties. Innes too came under heavy fire from a German barricade to their front equipped with a machine gun.|$|E
