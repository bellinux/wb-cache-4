5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} of employment of residents in 2011 was 16.1% retail, 17.2% {{health and social}} work, 5.8% manufacturing, 12.3% education, 1.3% real estate, 9.6% construction, 4.9% <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage,</b> 2.2% communications, 6.7% public administration, 4.3% hotels and restaurants, 3.1% finance, 0.8% agriculture, 1.1% energy and water supply, and 5.2% other community, social or personal services. Compared to national figures, the village had a relatively high number of workers in the construction and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing. Many residents commute to work outside the town; at the 2001 census, the town had 3,370 employed residents, but only 1,711 jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Croatian Littoral is largely {{centered}} on the city of Rijeka, whose economic impact is felt directly {{not only in the}} geographic region, but also in other parts of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County—Gorski Kotar and Liburnia (modern region)—and a substantial part of Lika-Senj County. The most significant economic activities in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County are transport, largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka, shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian Littoral, and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland. In the city of Rijeka itself, the most significant economic activities are civil engineering, wholesale and retail trade, <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> services, and the processing industry. Tourism, wood processing, and agriculture are the predominant economic activities in Lika-Senj County, where nearly all businesses are small and medium enterprisess.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{cycle of}} refusal {{continued}} through 1943 and into 1944. The explanation for these repeated refusals was invariably that the Allies had insufficient shipping, {{particularly in light}} of their plans to invade Normandybut this rationale has been debated. The Cabinet also refused offers of food shipments from several different nations. When such shipments did begin to increase modestly in late 1943, the <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> facilities were understaffed and inadequate.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III ordered {{one million}} cans of beef {{to feed his}} troops. The task of {{providing}} all this beef went to a Scotsman living in Canada named John Lawson Johnston. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later called Bovril, {{to meet the needs}} of Napoleon III. By 1888, over 3,000 UK public houses, grocers and dispensing chemists were selling Bovril. In 1889, the Bovril Company was formed.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{believe that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include the {{problems}} of processing, <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of radioactive nuclear waste, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong; {{and there have been}} serious nuclear accidents. Critics {{do not believe that the}} risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology. In years past, they also argued that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source.|$|E

25|$|When the {{decision}} was taken to utilise helium instead of hydrogen back in 1922, Shenandoah was fitted {{with a set of}} condensers to allow the collection of water vapour from her engine exhausts to be used to create ballast and manage the ship's buoyancy. In most airship designs this would have been accomplished simply by venting gas as fuel was burned, but because helium was so expensive to produce (approximately $55 per 1000ft3 in 1923), and Shenandoah had required approximately 2.1m ft3 to fill its gas cells, {{the decision}} was taken to not routinely vent the valuable gas, and instead collect water vapour. The Akron-class required three times more gas to fill the cells, which made the collection of water more important, in spite of the increased availability of helium through improvements in production, <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage.</b> The condensers appeared as black strips on the ship's envelope directly above each propeller.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the city of Zagreb {{represents}} the bulk of the economy of Croatia proper. Its most significant components are wholesale and retail trade, accounting for 38.1% of the city's economic income, followed by the processing industry, encompassing 20.3% of the economy of Zagreb. Further industries, by income share, are the energy industry—the supply of electric power, natural gas, steam, and air conditioning (7.8%); information and communications (7.2%); civil engineering (5.4%), professional technical and scientific services (4.6%); financial services (4.5%); and <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> services (3.9%). These account for 91.8% of the total income of the city's economy. Small businesses generate 22% of the total income; 14.4% is attributed to medium enterprises and the rest to large companies. The {{economy of the}} Zagreb County, largely contiguous with Zagreb's metropolitan area, is dominated by wholesale and retail trade (53.5% of total income) and the processing industry (25.7%), followed by transport (6.1%) and civil engineering (5.3%). Unlike the economy {{of the city of}} Zagreb, the county's economic income is largely generated by small and medium businesses (64.6%). The city of Zagreb and the Zagreb County dominate the economy of the Croatia proper and Croatia as a whole: nearly 91% of all Croatia's wholesale and retail trade companies and 45% of the Croatian processing industry is headquartered there.|$|E

500|$|Following his flight, a {{military}} dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued {{a ban on}} Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Perón in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name [...] "María Maggi." [...] It appeared that her body had been damaged during its <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage,</b> such as compressions to her face and disfigurement {{of one of her}} feet due to the body having been left in an upright position.|$|E

500|$|Even {{when the}} leaves were quickly cooled, {{if they are}} left in piles (渥堆) for too long before processing, the leaves will begin to undergo {{microbial}} fermentation to produce [...] "post-fermented tea". This technique is somewhat similar to composting, albeit tightly controlled, and still used {{in the production of}} Liu'an tea (安徽六安籃茶) and was more recently introduced for the production of the [...] "ripe" [...] type pu-erh tea. The production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post-fermented tea, which was produced by aging. The long <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> times of the day unwittingly allowed the tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to the elements and to various microflora, which resulted in the aging, oxidation, and fermentation of green brick teas. A brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post-fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of the layer of detritus, dust, and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder, cooked, and then consumed. By the end of Tang Dynasty (618-907CE) green, yellow, and post-fermented tea was commonly used in China and moved from purely being used in herbology to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure.|$|E
