5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of <b>Trucking</b> Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to <b>trucking.</b> The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation <b>trucking</b> company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of <b>Trucking</b> Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the U.S. <b>trucking</b> {{industry}} employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul <b>trucking</b> industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The <b>trucking</b> industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than <b>trucking</b> in 2004).|$|E

The Golden Age of <b>Trucking</b> Museum also featured a collection of toy trucks, hats, state license plates and images relating to <b>trucking.</b> Throughout its entire operation, the museum ran a deficit and it closed after a 2009 fund raising campaign failed.

40|$|<b>Truck</b> {{traffic is}} one of the major inputs to any {{pavement}} design procedure. In almost all pavement design procedures, <b>truck</b> traffic is represented in terms of the accumulated Equivalent Axle Load (EAL) applications. The level of EAL applications is mainly dependent on the prevailing values of <b>truck</b> factors. Thus efforts have to be made to accurately estimate <b>truck</b> factor values based on local loading conditions. The current practice of the Ministry of Communications (MOC) involves recording axle weights of loaded <b>trucks</b> only without including empty <b>trucks.</b> This, in turn, leads to higher <b>truck</b> factor estimates and consequently over-designed pavement structures. The main objective of this study is to quantify the effect of excluding empty <b>trucks</b> when estimating <b>truck</b> factors, on highway pavement design. The <b>truck</b> factors associated with loaded <b>trucks</b> were determined from MOC data files. The empty <b>truck</b> factors were determined from a field sample consisting of 4000 empty <b>trucks.</b> The empty-adjusted <b>truck</b> factors were calculated as the weighted average of the two <b>truck</b> factor values. An analysis has been conducted to study the effects of using the empty-adjusted <b>truck</b> factors on pavement design instead of loaded <b>truck</b> factors, using the AASHTO design procedure. The analysis indicated that the average <b>truck</b> factor for empty <b>trucks</b> is about 1. 15, the average <b>truck</b> factor for loaded <b>trucks</b> is about 9. 87 and the average empty-adjusted <b>truck</b> factor is about 6. 63. It also showed that excluding empty <b>trucks</b> would result in over-designs with an average of about SR 1. 0 / m 2 or about SR 3500 / km-lane extra construction cost...|$|R

5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, <b>trucking</b> began to achieve a significant foothold in the 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent.
