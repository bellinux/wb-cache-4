Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

[...] Peter Jonas succeeded Harewood as managing director.

500|$|Fodor {{responds}} {{to this problem}} with what he defines as [...] "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse"...|$|E

50|$|Both Sunnis and Shi'as {{accept the}} {{authenticity}} of the related Hadith of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> weighty <b>things</b> (Hadith al-Thaqalayn).

The Shi'as use the Hadith of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> weighty <b>things</b> to prove their claim that Muhammad meant for all his successors to be from his own family (Ahl al-Bayt).

On September 22, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, [...] "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> could be kept separate." [...] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.|$|E

2500|$|When Dyer's casting in {{the series}} was announced, Daniel Kilkelly from {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy expected reactions to be mixed, as comments made by the website's readers about Dyer {{in the past have}} included both praise and derision, and felt the announcement would spark debate. Kilkelly felt positive about the casting, saying: [...] "Dyer has a strong screen presence {{which is going to be}} crucial when it comes to taking over such an important role in EastEnders. Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer should definitely be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should be interesting to see how he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> together still don't quite seem believable, but it really is happening", and predicted he would be [...] "awesome".|$|E

2500|$|The second {{criticism}} that Hume offers {{is about the}} form of the argument as an analogy in itself. An analogical argument claims that because object X (a watch) is like object Y (the universe) in one respect, both are therefore probably alike in another, hidden, respect (their cause, having to be created by an intelligent designer). He points out that for an argument from analogy to be successful, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> that are being compared have to have an adequate number of similarities that are relevant to the respect that are analogised. For example, a kitten and a lion may be very similar in many respects, but just because a lion makes a [...] "roar", it would not be correct to infer a kitten also [...] "roars": the similarities between the two objects being not similar enough and the degree of relevance to what sound they make being not relevant enough. Hume then argues that the universe and a watch also do not have enough relevant or close similarities to infer that they were both created the same way. For example, the universe is made of organic natural material, but the watch is made of artificial mechanic materials. He claims that in the same respect, the universe could be argued to be more analogous to something more organic such as a vegetable (in which we can observe for ourselves does not need a 'designer' or a 'watchmaker' to be created). Although he admits the analogy of a universe to a vegetable to seem ridiculous, he says that it is just as ridiculous to analogize the universe with a watch.|$|E

Since the Hadith about Quran and Sunnah was said by Muhammad in front of the larger gathering during his Farewell Sermon, and the Hadith about Quran and Ahl al-Bayt was said by Muhammad in front of the smaller gathering at Ghadir Khumm, the Shias believe that only the Hadith of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> weighty <b>things</b> is authentic.|$|R
