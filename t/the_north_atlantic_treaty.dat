Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.|$|E

Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s.

5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway.

However, Norway's entry into <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion.
