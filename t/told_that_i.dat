5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E

500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

2500|$|According to Salk: [...] "My {{intention}} {{was to go to}} medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. Later, when I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had no chance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not mean}} to be ungrateful, or to say hard things; but when you made me feel that if he were {{satisfied}} I also might put up with it, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could never love him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did love, and ever should love, Walter Marrable. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had nothing--nothing--nothing to give him. But he would take no answer but the one; and I did--I did give it him. I know I did; and I have never had a moment of happiness since. And now has come this letter. Janet, do not be cruel to me. Do not speak to me as though everything must be stern and hard and cruel." [...] Then she handed up the letter, and Mrs. Fenwick read it as they walked.|$|R

2500|$|Welsh {{classical}} singer Katherine Jenkins {{recorded a}} cover version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] on her 2009 album Believe. Jenkins said: [...] "I'd mentioned that I {{wanted to try}} Evanescence's Bring Me to Life and David [...] said 'you can't sing that'. I came out there questioning my vocal abilities. I'm just not used to being <b>told</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> went home that night and I just thought to myself 'you have to pull yourself together, he's worked with so many incredible artists you {{have to step up}} the plate.' I did talk myself round and I went in there the next day on a mission. It's good to be pushed sometimes – and I proved him wrong!" [...] Jenkins decided to change the [...] guitar-led and percussive original version and instead, [...] "make it more orchestral with the percussion coming from the strings." [...] Alfred Hickling of The Guardian gave a mixed review of Jenkins' cover, calling it [...] "histrionic." [...] However, a writer of BBC Online chose her version of the song as a highlight on the album. On October 23, 2009, the song was available for digital download as the second single from Believe. On November 23, 2011, Jenkins sang the song live at the Leicester Square station in London.|$|E
