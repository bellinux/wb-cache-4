40|$|Clean bond {{surfaces}} {{are critical to}} the operation of diffusion bonded titanium engine components. These components can be contaminated with machining coolant, shop dirt, and fingerprints during normal processing and handling. These contaminants must be removed to achieve acceptable bond quality. As environmental concerns become more important in manufacturing, elimination {{of the use of}} hazardous materials is desired. For this reason, another process (not using nitric-hydrofluoric acid solution) to clean titanium parts before bonding was sought. Initial cleaning trials were conducted at Honeywell to screen potential cleaning techniques and chemistries. During the initial cleaning process screening phase, Pratt and Whitney provided Honeywell with machined 3 inch x 3 inch x 1 inch titanium <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> These <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> were machined with a water-based machining coolant and exposed to a normal shop environment and handling. (Honeywell sectioned one of these blocks into smaller samples to be used for additional cleanliness verification analyses.) The sample <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> were ultrasonically cleaned in alkaline solutions and AUGER analysis was used by Honeywell FM and T to validate their cleanliness. This information enabled selection of final cleaning techniques and solutions to be used for the bonding trials. To validate Honeywell's AUGER data and to verify the cleaning processes in actual situations, additional sample blocks were cleaned (using the chosen processes) and then bonded. The bond quality of the <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> was analyzed according to Pratt and Whitney's requirements. The Charpy impact testing was performed according to ASTM procedure {number_sign}E- 23.

40|$|In this paper, {{complementary}} Huffman coding {{techniques are}} proposed for test data compression / decompression of complex SOC designs during manufacturing testing. In-stead of the compatible relationship between <b>test</b> data <b>blocks,</b> complementary features between <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> are also exploited. Based on this property, more <b>test</b> data <b>blocks</b> can {{share the same}} codeword {{and the size of}} the modified Huffman tree can be reduced. This will not only reduce the area overhead of the decoding circuitry but also substantially in-crease the compression ratio. A graph model is also proposed for don’t-care assignment of test cube. This problem can be transformed to the clique partitioning problem whose complexity is basically NP-hard. Therefore, in order to exploit the compatible and com-plementary relationships between <b>test</b> <b>blocks,</b> a heuristic algorithm is proposed for filling test cubes. Thereafter, given the set of test vectors, two algorithms are proposed for complementary Huffman encoding. The compression ratio and hardware overhead of the decoding circuitry are analyzed. According to experimental results, the area overhead of the decompression circuit is lower than that of the full Huffman coding technique. However, it is a little bit higher than that of the selective Huffman coding technique. Moreover, the compression ratio is higher than that of the selective and optimal selective Huffman coding techniques...|$|R

The maximum force applied before the TAD was fully dislodged was recorded.
