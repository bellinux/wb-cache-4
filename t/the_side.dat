5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas <b>the</b> <b>side</b> that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas <b>the</b> <b>side</b> that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E

50|$|The {{turnouts}} for <b>the</b> loop <b>siding</b> came due {{for renewal}} in 1959 {{and it was}} suggested that perhaps <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> should be closed altogether.

My analysis of 50 IT outsourcing efforts shows that both <b>the</b> hard <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> soft <b>side</b> {{are key to}} success. <b>The</b> hard <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> soft <b>side</b> are often used separately. The greater the contractual hazards that characterize an IT outsourcing operation, the more likely <b>the</b> soft <b>side</b> will be preferred over <b>the</b> hard <b>side.</b> However, <b>the</b> hard <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> soft <b>side</b> can also be simultaneously used.

50|$|The {{diagonal}} {{orientation of}} the window can complicate the placement of <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> (such as clapboards) {{on the wall in}} which the window is hung, because if <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> is horizontal, it will meet the window frame at an acute angle, complicating both the cutting of <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> and <b>the</b> waterproofing of the frame-siding joint.
