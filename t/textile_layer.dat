[...] Due to environmental laws, any seepage from landfills must be collected and properly disposed off, otherwise contamination of the surrounding ground water could cause major environmental and/or ecological problems. The lower the hydraulic conductivity the more effective the GCL will be at retaining seepage inside of the landfill. Bentonite composed predominantly (>70%) of montmorillonite or other expansive clays, are preferred and most commonly used in GCLs. A general GCL construction would consist of two layers of geosynthetics stitched together enclosing a layer of natural or processed sodium bentonite.

40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of stiffness {{and strength of}} textile composites is expensive and timeconsuming. Experimental tests are only capable of delivering properties of a whole <b>textile</b> <b>layer,</b> because a decomposition is not possible. However, a <b>textile</b> <b>layer,</b> consisting of several fiber directions, has the drawback that {{it is likely to}} exhibit anisotropic material behavior. In the presented paper a finite element multiscale analysis is proposed that is able to predict material behavior of textile composites via virtual tests, solely from the (nonlinear) material behavior of epoxy resin and glass fibers, as well as the textile fiber architecture. With these virtual tests it is possible to make predictions for a single layer within a textile preform or for multiple textile layers at once. The nonlinear and pressure-dependent behavior of the materials covered in the multiscale analysis is modeled with novel material models developed for this purpose. In order to avoid mesh-dependent solutions in the finite-element simulations, regularization techniques are applied. The simulations are compared to experimental test results. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination between the innovative thixoforging process and the potential of fibre or particle strengthened composites with metallic matrices (MMCs) provides an efficient manufacturing process of structural components with continuous or gradient reinforcements.

The system is constructed using off-the-shelf components and it is shown that the wirelessly-powered sensor system is able to operate when just a few mW are transmitted from a base station at a distance over a metre. Initially, standard linearly-polarized patch antennas are used for power transmission. However, the antennas have to be aligned perfectly for the best efficiency. Subsequently, a circularly-polarized antenna is proposed for enhanced wireless-power transfer due to the freedom of orientation. A wide-slot antenna without a ground plane has been chosen for its simplicity and wide impedance band. The geometry is firstly optimized for wide impedance and 3 -dB axial ratio bandwidth on FR- 4. The experimental and simulation results have been studied to analyse the characteristics of such an antenna. The wideband circularly-polarized antenna is then constructed using a conductive textile and re-optimized for on-body applications. With a simple antenna geometry and only a single layer of conductive <b>textile</b> <b>layer,</b> the axial ratio and impedance bandwidths are wide enough to cover the whole 2. 45 GHz ISM band with plenty of margin and are significantly wider than any other on-body circularly-polarized textile patch antennas which have been reported.

Karger AG, Basel] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] temperature regulation is based upon a physiological system 'designed' for a naked person. Hence, the statement 'man is a tropical animal'. Human thermoregulation can be described as a feedback system with sensors in the body core and the skin, and effectors in the form of skin blood flow (vasoconstriction and dilation), metabolic activity (shivering), pilo-erection and sweating. This system on its own would provide some adjustment capabilities to various environments, but would nevertheless limit man to life in warm environments. It is the behavioural response that is the most powerful additional thermoregulatory effector in humans. People wear clothing, live in houses and have active heating and cooling systems to expand their habitat beyond the original physiological limits. Clothing is an important interface between the human and the environment. Apart from the cultural meaning of clothing it provides insulation against cold, protection against the sun, wind or rain as well as protection from other environmental hazards (chemicals, mechanical). The effect of clothing on thermoregulation depends in the first place on the textile materials used. These provide thermal insulation as well as resistance against vapour (sweat) transfer. However, a garment is more than just the <b>textile</b> <b>layer.</b> Air layers included in the clothing provide additional insulation and the total thermal protection provided by a garment is for a large part based on these enclosed air layers and strongly influenced by the clothing design and fit.

Excess heat {{has been}} {{produced}} by a method conceptually {{similar to that of}} Pons and Fleischmann except that it does not involve electrolysis or even water (heavy or light). Instead of putting hydrogen into the system by operation for a few days, the hydrogen solute is quenched into the electrode alloy, by temperature and pressure, before the cell is assembled. The cell contains two hydrogenated alloy electrodes separated by an insulating <b>textile</b> <b>layer.</b> Substituting for the Pons-Fleischmann (P-F) electrolyte, an oil based conductor containing very fine particles of an electrically conducting solid is soaked into the separator textile. Thus, the cell is a low Q capacitor, with the nuclear active environment initially installed. I believe that a basis for the P-F effect is a critical distribution of electric current {{across the surface of the}} cathode, both spatially and temporally, that is regulated by the moving layer of electrolytic hydrogen bubbles on that surface. Erratic behaviour of those bubbles accounts for the inconsistency typically observed in P-F experiments. In my work, the fine particles in the conductor create near-point-sources of current that (with brownian motion) create the charge distribution that seems necessary to trigger the nuclear reaction producing P-F excess heat. Typically, the low Q capacitor method has yielded about 15 % more thermal energy than electric power input. Excess heat increases disporportionally with increasing electrical current. The system seems far from optimized, however. With the oil-based conductor, excess heat appears almost immediately, and much more consistently, compared to the classic P-F method. There are also more, and more-controllable, variables for optimization of the effect.

The experimental results revealed that: (1) TRM is very effective when the failure is attributed to debonding of the TRM jacket from the concrete substrate; (2) the trend of effective strains for carbon, glass and basalt TRM jackets is descending for increasing values of the TRM reinforcement ratio, ρf, when failure is associated to debonding of the jacket; (3) the effect of textile geometry is significant only for low values of ρf, resulting in variances in the capacity enhancement and the failure modes, and (4) the shear span-to-depth ratio has practically no effect to the failure mode nor to the TRM jacket contribution to the total shear resistance of the RC beams...|$|R
40|$|In chemical, biological, radiological, {{and nuclear}} {{protective}} clothing, {{a layer of}} activated carbon material in between two <b>textile</b> <b>layers</b> provides protection against hazardous gases. A cylinder in cross flow, sheathed by such material, is generally used to experimentally test the garment properties. This is, however, complicated and predictive models are needed. We present a computational fluid dynamics model for the initial phase in which the carbon filter material is not yet saturated. The textiles are modeled as chemically inactive porous layers, the carbon filter particles have been resolved explicitly. The model has been validated against experimental data. We demonstrate that (1) computational fluid dynamics simulations {{can be used for}} the efficient design and optimization of protective garments, and (2) the addition of a highly porous active carbon layer highly increases the chemical protection capabilities, while having relatively little negative impact on the thermal comfort of protective garments. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 60 : 353 - 361, 2014 © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers 60 1 January 2014 10. 1002 /aic. 14246 Transport Phenomena and Fluid Mechanics Transport Phenomena and Fluid Mechanics © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{response}} of textile-reinforced aerated concrete sandwich panels was investigated using an instrumented three-point bending experiment under static and low-velocity dynamic loading. Two types of aerated concrete: {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) and polymeric Fiber-Reinforced Aerated Concrete (FRAC) were used as the core material. Skin layer consisted of two layers of Alkali Resistant Glass (ARG) textiles and a cementitious binder. Performance of ductile skin-brittle core (TRC-AAC) and ductile skin-ductile core (TRC-FRAC) composites was evaluated in terms of flexural stiffness, strength, and energy absorption capacity. The effect of impact energy on the mechanical properties was measured at various drop heights on two different cross-sections using energy levels up to 40 J and intermediate strain rates up to 20 s(- 1). The externally bonded <b>textile</b> <b>layers</b> significantly improved the mechanical properties of light-weight low-strength aerated concrete core under both loading modes. Dynamic flexural strength was greater than the static flexural strength {{by as much as}} 4 times. For specimens with larger cross-sections, unreinforced-autoclaved AAC core had a 15 % higher apparent flexural capacity. With 0. 5 % volume of polypropylene fibers in the core, the flexural toughness however increased by 25 %. Cracking mechanisms were studied using high speed image acquisition and digital image correlation (DIC) technique...|$|R
