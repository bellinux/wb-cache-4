25|$|The orangery {{was added}} to the house by the 2nd Earl of Wilton around 1823. It was {{probably}} designed by Lewis Wyatt as it is similar to his orangeries at Tatton Park and Belton House. It was probably built for the wife of the 2nd Earl, Lady Mary Stanley, who was a keen botanist. It was designed with a domed, glazed roof, fronted by a formal garden with two large copies of the Borghese Vase. The ornate glass roof was removed, to be replaced with a flat roof after Manchester City Council purchased the park in 1902.

A computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} {{used to compare the}} economic impact of subsidies between professional and technical ser-vices, high-technology manufacturing and <b>traded</b> <b>services.</b> The results suggest that the largest increase in aggregate real income is a factor tax deduction on capital to high-technology manufacturing. A factor tax deduction for the purchase of labor within professional and technical services industries increases aggregate real income in comparison to the same subsidy awarded to high-technology manufacturing or traded ser-vices.
