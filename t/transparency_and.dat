40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} are to analyze the effect of <b>transparencies</b> <b>and</b> accountabilities of education management on level of participation of parents of students at SMA Negeri 107 Jakarta. Stratified random sampling was performed to select 87 respondents from the study population (i. e., 693 parents of students at SMA Negeri 107 Jakarta). Data concerning perceptions of respondents towards <b>transparencies</b> <b>and</b> accountability of education management as well as their willingness to participate in education management at the school were collected from respondents using a set of valid and reliable questionnaires. Multiple linear regression analysis wasapplied to analyze the data.

English was removed {{as an official}} language from the constitution approved by voters in the November 2010 referendum. The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> inclusiveness {{in the way the}} election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{programme}} editor {{resigned from}} his position in June 2015 over a one-off price rise of the programme for Broadhurst Park's opening game against Benfica the previous month; a Board decision that was described as breaching the club's founding principle of avoiding outright commercialism.

5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform prioritized direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. <b>Transparency</b> <b>and</b> reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

In 2009, the IMA was awarded the National Medal for Museum and Library Service for public service, specifically the museum's free admission policy and educational programming.|$|E

5|$|Morales' {{government}} also introduced measures to tackle Bolivia's endemic corruption; in 2007, {{he used a}} presidential decree to create the Ministry of Institutional <b>Transparency</b> <b>and</b> Fight Against Corruption. However, critics highlighted that MAS members were rarely prosecuted for the crime, the main exception being YPFB head Santos Ramírez, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for corruption in 2008. Conversely, a 2009 law that permitted the retroactive prosecution for corruption led to legal cases being brought against a number of opposition politicians for alleged corruption in the pre-Morales period; many fled abroad to avoid standing trial.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{moves into}} {{crystallography}} and mineralogy, describing the octahedral {{shape of the}} diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states that rock crystal is valuable for its <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item.

5|$|Research and {{academic}} institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations {{to improve the}} <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> effectiveness of the global financial system.

The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world.

Whereas more and more professors put their <b>transparencies</b> <b>and</b> exercises on the Web, the tremendous amount of extra work required by traditional CBT authoring prevents them from producing a multimedia version for self-paced learning. Our conversion system bridges this gap: we decompose a set of transparencies created with an arbitrary text editor into a linked list of HTML documents and automatically add the appropriate audio and video tracks. Supplementary material such as animations, simulations, exercises and self-test questionnaires can be integrated based on a configuration file...|$|R
5|$|Since the 2012 elections, Johnson has {{continued}} to criticize the Obama administration on various issues.

5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> very low distortion. Its {{midrange}} performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E

Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
