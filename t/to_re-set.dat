2500|$|Since the 1990s, the opera, and {{productions}} of it, have sometimes drawn {{criticism from the}} Asian-American community as promoting [...] "simplistic orientalist stereotypes". In 2014, after a production in Seattle, Washington, drew national attention to such criticism, the Gilbert biographer Andrew Crowther wrote that The Mikado [...] "does not portray any of the characters as being [...] "racially inferior" [...] or indeed fundamentally any different from British people. The point of the opera is to reflect British culture {{through the lens of}} an invented [...] "other", a fantasy Japan that has only the most superficial resemblance to reality." [...] For example, the starting point for the plot of The Mikado is [...] "an invented 'Japanese' law against flirting, which makes sense only as a reference to the sexual prudishness of British culture". However, Crowther noted, production design and other features of traditionally staged {{productions of}} the opera, often [...] "do look somewhat insensitive, not to say insulting. ... It should [...] to avoid such things in the future, with a little sensitivity. ... G is about silliness, and fun, and ... mocking the powerful, and accepting the fundamental absurdity of life". Some commentators dismissed the criticism as political correctness. A public discussion of the issue in Seattle a month later, however, drew a large crowd where nearly all agreed that, although works like The Mikado should not be abandoned in their traditional form, there should be [...] "some kind of contextualizing apparatus to show that the producers and performers are at least thinking about the problems in the work". In 2015, a planned production by the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players was withdrawn after its publicity materials ignited a similar protest in the Asian-American blogosphere. The company redesigned its Mikado production and debuted the new concept in December 2016, receiving a warm review from The New York Times. After Lamplighters Music Theatre of San Francisco planned a 2016 production, objections by the Asian-American community prompted them <b>to</b> <b>re-set</b> the opera in Renaissance-era Milan, eliminating all references to Japan. Reviewers felt that the change resolved the issue.|$|E

Reader, if you wish to know why, go and do what he did, and if you feel no curious sensations about the region of the loins after it, we will tell you why Dick Varley wouldn't have listened to that advice. Can a man feel as if his joints were wrenched out of their sockets, and listen to advice--be that advice good or bad? Can he feel as though these joints were trying <b>to</b> <b>re-set</b> and re-dislocate themselves perpetually--and listen to advice? Can he feel as if he were sitting down on red-hot iron, when he's not sitting down at all--and listen to advice? Can he--but no! why pursue the subject?

50|$|An anxiety {{dream is}} an {{unpleasant}} dream which is {{can be more}} or less disturbing than a nightmare. Anxiety dreams are characterized by the feelings of unease, distress, or apprehension in the dreamer upon waking. Anxiety dreams occur in rapid eye movement sleep, and usual themes involve incomplete tasks, embarrassment, falling, or pursuit. Anxiety dreams may be caused by childhood trauma, or an adult dealing with conflict. Though they create anxiety in the dreamer, anxiety dreams also serve as a way for a person's ego <b>to</b> <b>re-set.</b>|$|E

It does, however, prove to the driver whether the route is correctly set up, and if the route is wrongly set he could ask the signalman <b>to</b> <b>re-set</b> the route before starting the train. Otherwise, if the route was set up wrongly, he would start the train, set off down the wrong route, discover the mistake, need to set back, have the route re-set, etc., all of which would waste a lot of time.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also worth}} noting, that with any fever the dog should be {{monitored}} to insure their temperature does not rise above 105 degrees. At that temperature several complications can occur. Aspirin and other NSAIDs {{should not be}} given at home, as they can have unintended side effects and can {{make it difficult to}} treat with other, safer NSAIDs such as Rimadyl. If the dog's temperature rises above 105, you should take it to an emergency vet. There are several things that can be done, one being the administration of Rimadyl to reduce the pain and fever. (It should be noted that Rimadyl does not reduce fever, but does help with pain and inflammation.) Fluids under the skin or intravenous may also be very helpful. Applying rubbing alcohol to the pads of the feet and giving cold water will make the dog temporarily more comfortable, but it will not help in the long term. The dog's internal 'thermostat' needs <b>to</b> be <b>re-set</b> <b>to</b> a normal temperature, and that can only be accomplished with medications and fluids.|$|R
50|$|The Medicare Part D {{coverage}} gap (informally {{known as}} the Medicare donut hole) {{is a period of}} consumer payment for prescription medication costs which lies between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic-coverage threshold, when the consumer is a member of a Medicare Part D prescription-drug program administered by the United States federal government. The gap is reached after shared insurer payment - consumer payment for all covered prescription drugs reaches a government-set amount, and is left only after the consumer has paid full, unshared costs of an additional amount for the same prescriptions. Upon entering the gap, the prescription payments <b>to</b> date are <b>re-set</b> <b>to</b> $0 and continue until the maximum amount of the gap is reached: copayments made by the consumer up to the point of entering the gap are specifically not counted toward payment of the costs accruing while in the gap.|$|R

5000|$|This {{basic design}} {{remained}} unchanged for centuries, {{with the most}} significant changes being to the overall proportions, and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late 1830s and early 1840s.

When this happens, the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom, and in some cases may need to be hauled up <b>to</b> be <b>re-set.</b> In the mid-19th century, numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems, as well as improve holding power, including one-armed mooring anchors.

25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the gyros had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit and have <b>to</b> be <b>re-set</b> from scratch - something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the gyros {{were found to be}} off, the leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|R

The Colts won a Saturday game in Green Bay (eliminating the Packers from playoff contention) 16-3. On Sunday, the Bears, the breaks, and the officials all {{played a role in the}} Bears 17-16 win that eliminated the Rams. The Bears played inspired defense, even knocking quarterback Roman Gabriel out of the game for a time. The Rams blocked a Bears punt, but it rolled out of the end zone for a safety just before the Rams were about to recover the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. Finally, trailing by a point, Gabriel rallied the Rams and appeared to pass them into field goal range. But a late flag for clipping cost the Rams the gain and set them back 15 yards into their own territory. At the same time, the officials neglected <b>to</b> <b>re-set</b> the down marker back to 3rd down (the down is supposed to go over on a penalty), so when the next play was an incomplete pass, the officials awarded the Bears the ball. The Rams protested vehemently that it was still their ball down but to no avail. The NFL later acknowledged the officials' mistake but said the result of the game could not be changed.|$|E
