Yet in our new post-modern classroom, the long-established role of the music teacher is no longer the sole champion of the program; rather, they have taken on a new role, one that shares the responsibility of creating and maintaining the culture of the classroom with numerous partners, including the student and the broader community. The research is divided into three sections: the first defines and examines the role of the music teacher first as a modern educator, then looks at what today’s music classroom appears to be, {{and the role of the}} music teacher as an transformational educator and champion in the post-modern organization; the second section identifies key culture concepts within <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> and program and how students both influence and determine the outcome both on their own and with the teacher champion, and; the third section sets about determining intrinsic factors within the school community and their relationship upon the music student, teacher, and classroom program.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} {{the meaning of the}} concept of {{creativity}} from the perspective of student teachers pursuing a one year teacher training course following their first degree. Seventeen student teachers following a specialist music teaching route in secondary education were selected as the sample for this study to offer their understanding on creativity in the secondary music classroom. Data were collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews and were subject to in-depth qualitative analysis using Atlas. ti software. All student teachers seemed eager to teach for creativity as they thought it was a vital component of their pupils’ musical engagement and development. However, some held richer conceptions than others or tended to overlook significant areas of musical involvement, such as improvisation, group work and engagement in evaluating and refining the creative musical product. Creativity was generally expected but it would emerge on an intuitive level as a by-product of a learning objective rather than being explicitly considered in the planning process. These narrow conceptions of the meaning of creativity in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> need to be taken seriously and explicitly addressed in music education programs in order to maximize the expression of pupils’ creative potential in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> and beyond. ...|$|E
