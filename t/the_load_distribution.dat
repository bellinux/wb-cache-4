40|$|Current {{literature}} on the three dimensional flow through compressor cascades deals with a row of rotor blades in isolation. Since {{the distance between the}} rotor and stator is usually 10 to 20 percent of the blade chord, the aerodynamic interference between them has to be considered for a proper evaluation of the aerothermodynamic performance of the stage. A unified approach to the aerodynamics of the incompressible flow through a stage is presented that uses the lifting surface theory for a compressor cascade of arbitrary camber and thickness distribution. The effects of rotor stator interference are represented as a linear function of the rotor and stator flows separately. <b>The</b> <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> on <b>the</b> rotor and stator flows separately. <b>The</b> <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> on <b>the</b> rotor and stator blades and the interference factor are determined concurrently through a matrix iteration process...|$|R

The cast steel allows for the production of geometrically complicated pipe nodes and an optimal alignment to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>distribution.</b> Nowadays dynamically curved cast steel nodes are used for street bridges (Nesenbachtal Bridge, Stuttgart) and railroad bridges (Humboldthafen Bridge, Berlin) as well as for high rise buildings (Exhibition Hall 13, Hannover).|$|E
50|$|Additionally, most kilns have {{temperature}} {{differences from}} top to bottom. The amount of difference depends {{on the design of}} the kiln, the age of the heating elements, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>distribution</b> in the kiln, and the cone number to which the kiln is fired. Usually, kilns have a greater temperature difference at cooler cone numbers. Cones should be used on the lower, middle and top shelves to determine how much difference exists during firing. This will aid in the way the kiln is loaded and fired to reduce the difference. Downdraft venting will also even out temperatures variance.|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} presents load-transfer curves evaluated from {{static load}} tests performed on large-diameter pipe piles in silty soils. Safe and economical deep foundation design requires an accurate prediction of settlement and pile <b>load</b> <b>distribution.</b> Foundation settlement is commonly estimated using <b>the</b> <b>load</b> transfer or 2 ̆ 2 t-z 2 ̆ 2 method where the pile and supporting soil are modeled {{as a system}} of springs. The soil springs describe <b>the</b> <b>load</b> transfer along <b>the</b> pile shaft (t-z curve) and at the pile toe (q z curve). The t-z curves published for sands and clays have been derived from theory or from analysis of full-scale loading tests on slender piles. However, there are currently no t-z curves in the literature that are specifically for silts. The application of existing t-z curves to a large diameter pile in silt is uncertain because {{of the differences in}} soil behavior and possibly the effects of pile diameter. ^ This study presents t-z curves developed from the analysis of existing load test data from two 1. 8 -meter diameter pipe piles in silty soil in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Strain gage measurements were used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> down <b>the</b> piles. One of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> was adjusted for residual <b>loads.</b> <b>The</b> t-z data were directly calculated from <b>the</b> pile <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> and normalized to compare them to t-z curves for sands from the literature. The developed curves show a softer load-movement response as compared to published empirical t-z curves from slender piles in sands. Using existing empirical t-z curves could lead to an inaccurate load-transfer interpretation and an underestimation of settlement. The developed t-z data compare favorably with existing theoretical t-z curves for sand but only after reducing the soil shear modulus for disturbance effects associated with installation of the pile. ...|$|R

50|$|Although not as sceptical or rigorously investigative as Brunel, Stephenson {{had a deep}} {{understanding}} of the different strengths of wrought- and cast-iron. Both girders are formed of wrought iron tubes, 6 cm in diameter. The unusual feature of this bridge is that because the deck is above the truss, the vertical members are placed in compression, rather than the more normal tension. This allowed Stephenson to use cast iron for the vertical members, rather than the more expensive wrought iron needed for bridges in tension. The truss achieves an efficient symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>distribution</b> between the two members, giving an economical and balanced appearance that is in great contrast to Brunel's heavily unbalanced designs that (for Chepstow at least) are barely recognisable as lenticular.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} in part by the ARC Energies Région Rhône-Alpes, in part by the ANR PARADISE Project, in part by the Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, and in part by the Grenoble Image Parole Signal Automatique Laboratory, France. International audienceAn application of an evolutionary game dynamics called mixed strategist dynamics (MSD), for <b>the</b> decentralized <b>load</b> scheduling of plug-in electric vehicles(PEVs), is proposed in this paper. Following an analogy with the maximum entropy principle (MEP) for tuning parameters of discrete probability distributions, entropy of <b>the</b> total <b>load</b> <b>distribution</b> and <b>the</b> local <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> are considered as objectives of the scheduling approach, and a tradeoff among them is defined by the electric vehicle owners’ convenience. While entropy maximization for <b>the</b> local <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> contributes to preserve the batteries’ states of health, entropy maximization for <b>the</b> total <b>load</b> <b>distribution</b> reduces <b>the</b> undesirable peak effects over <b>the</b> transformer <b>loading.</b> <b>The</b> problem is formulated such that final states of charge are assured depending on time constraints defined by the owners. Furthermore, mixed strategies in the MSD are defined such that they represent the vertices of the convex set of feasible load profiles which results from the constraints imposed by owners and chargers. The synergy of several PEVs is modeled as an application of the MSD in a multipopulation scenario, where the interaction among populations follows another evolutionary game dynamics called best reply (BR) dynamics. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on real data measured on a distribution transformer from the SOREA utility grid company in the region of Savoie, France...|$|R

40|$|Background Bones {{continually}} adapt their morphology {{to their}} load bearing function. At {{the level of}} the subchondral bone, the density distribution is highly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> of <b>the</b> joint. Therefore, subchondral bone density distribution can be used to study joint biomechanics non-invasively. In addition physiological and pathological joint loading is an important aspect of orthopaedic disease, and research focusing on joint biomechanics will benefit veterinary orthopaedics. This study was conducted to evaluate density distribution in the subchondral bone of the canine talus, as a parameter reflecting <b>the</b> long-term joint <b>loading</b> in <b>the</b> tarsocrural joint. Results Two main density maxima were found, one proximally on the medial trochlear ridge and one distally on the lateral trochlear ridge. All joints showed very similar density distribution patterns and {{no significant differences were found}} in the localisation of the density maxima between left and right limbs and between dogs. Conclusions Based on the density distribution the lateral trochlear ridge is most likely subjected to highest <b>loads</b> within <b>the</b> tarsocrural joint. <b>The</b> joint <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> is very similar between dogs of the same breed. In addition, <b>the</b> joint <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> supports previous suggestions of the important role of biomechanics in the development of OC lesions in the tarsus. Important benefits of computed tomographic osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM), i. e. the possibility of in vivo imaging and temporal evaluation, make this technique a valuable addition to the field of veterinary orthopaedic research. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Originally, the Class 01's {{top speed}} was {{restricted}} to 120 km/h. In order to raise this to 130 km/h, {{the diameter of the}} leading wheels was changed from its original 850 mm to 1,000 mm on locomotives from operating number 01 102 onwards and brake effort was increased by installing double-sided working of the brake shoes on the coupled wheels and by braking the trailing wheels. The air and feed pumps were located in smokebox recesses behind the large Wagner smoke deflectors, which had been fitted from 01 077 onwards. (Earlier models were also refitted with Wagner type deflectors later). This made access to the pumps for maintenance purposes more difficult and later Einheitsloks had their pumps located {{in the middle of the}} vehicle on delivery. The Deutsche Bundesbahn converted their engines to the smaller Witte smoke deflectors and moved the pumps to the running board in the centre of the vehicle.
