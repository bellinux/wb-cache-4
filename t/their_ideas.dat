5|$|In February 2011, King's College London {{students}} founded London's first student-led think tank, the King’s Think Tank (formerly {{known as}} KCL Think Tank). With a membership {{of more than}} 2000, {{it is the largest}} organisation of its kind in Europe. This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other policymakers with <b>their</b> <b>ideas.</b> Every September, it produces a peer-reviewed journal of policy recommendations called The Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E

5|$|Sexist attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men in the {{leadership}} often did not take women or <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> seriously, and excluded them from many discussions. Domestic violence and sexual harassment continued to exist. Yet, sociological studies at the time found that Soviet women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon goes {{to get a}} haircut; {{his usual}} barber Mr. D'Onofrio is in a coma, so the barber's nephew Angelo (Peter Onorati) is there instead. Sheldon is uncomfortable with the {{situation}} and runs away. Later, he talks to his friends; Penny (Kaley Cuoco) offers to cut his hair while Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) suggest other barbers. He rejects all of <b>their</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The missile {{guidance}} {{strategy of}} pure proportional navigation guidance (PPNG) closely resembles the CATD strategy used by bats. The biologists Andrew Anderson and Peter McOwan {{have suggested that}} anti-aircraft missiles could exploit motion camouflage to reduce their chances of being detected.

5|$|Though {{the episode}} itself was penned by Jeremy Carver, the writing staff contributed <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> to the storyline. Within {{five minutes of}} brainstorming, they envisioned three scenes they had to do: the teaser, where a {{grandfather}} pretending to be Santa is pulled up the chimney and slaughtered; a boy witnessing the Santa-dressed villain brutally killing his father and then eating one of the cookies for Santa; and the Winchesters killing someone with a Christmas tree.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb {{began to}} {{consider}} a Jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silađin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> for a new Jewish center in Praška Street. Silađin's vision was ultimately not accepted by the Jewish community; instead, plans were being made {{for the construction of}} the cultural center and a synagogue, following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed.|$|E
50|$|A Dutch venture named High 5 Business Solution V.O.F. {{wants to}} develop a portal which allows {{companies}} to order lunch. To open this portal, the venture needs some financial resources, they also need marketeers and market researchers to investigate {{whether there is a}} market for <b>their</b> <b>idea.</b> To attract these financial and non-financial resources, the executives of the venture decide to approach ABN AMRO Bank to see if the bank is interested in <b>their</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R

5|$|Creators {{and writers}} David Crane and Marta Kauffman were {{known in the}} {{television}} industry for writing the cable television series Dream On. A second series by the duo, Family Album, had premiered on CBS in the Fall 1993 season but was cancelled after airing six episodes. In November 1993, they began developing three new television pilots from their offices at Warner Bros. Television that could premiere in the Fall 1994 season. As Dream On had won them clout in Hollywood, they aimed to pitch one of <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> to NBC; Insomnia Cafe, about six friends {{who live and work}} in New York City, was pitched as a seven-page treatment to the network in December 1993.|$|E
5|$|Early Jain texts {{were not}} {{composed}} in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing {{form of a}} substantial anekantavada doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.|$|E
5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

50|$|Potential pitchers, who cannot {{already be}} {{established}} filmmakers, must submit {{a very brief}} description of <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> for a documentary film. The eight most compelling ideas are selected, and the shortlisted directors must then pitch <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> to a panel of Channel 4 commissioners {{in front of an}} industry audience at the annual Sheffield International Documentary Festival. The winning director is awarded a £30,000 commission to make their film, and professional mentorship from a Channel 4 editor.|$|R
5|$|Mason {{prepared}} {{the first draft}} of the Declaration of Rights in 1776, and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Revolutionary Virginia Convention. He also wrote a constitution for the state; Thomas Jefferson and others sought to have the convention adopt <b>their</b> <b>ideas,</b> but they found that Mason's version could not be stopped. During the war, Mason {{was a member of the}} powerful lower house of the Virginia General Assembly, the House of Delegates but, to the irritation of Washington and others, he refused to serve in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, citing health and family commitments.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with <b>their</b> <b>ideas.</b> Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E

5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual Art to the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of The Triumph of Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied <b>their</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>ideas</b> {{were well}} {{received}} by TSR, whose marketing department {{felt they had}} enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, {{after a period of}} months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.|$|E
5|$|At the school, Crawford was {{influenced}} by his housemaster, F. B. Malim, {{who presided over the}} archaeological section of the college's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy's interest in the subject. It is possible that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford. With the society, Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge, West Kennet Long Barrow, Avebury, and Martinsell. It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape, allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts' home. He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull's Copse, thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake, who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire. Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle, being vegetarians and social reformers, and <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> had a strong impact on Crawford. Under the Peakes' influence, Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world-view based in science. Crawford gained an appreciation from Peake for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape rather than simply through texts or artefacts.|$|E

I also wanted to find out what is <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> about folk dance, and if <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> coincides with reality. Part of my work was a lesson in folk dance for non-dancers. After completing this lesson participants shared their opinions and suggestions from which I have learned how the folk dance worked with them...|$|R
