25|$|By tradition, rifle regiments do {{not carry}} colours; <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their formation, {{when they were}} used as skirmishers and sharpshooters. While {{individual}} units may have had banners or pennants to distinguish themselves from other units, regiments as a whole never needed a full stand of Colours. Today, the two rifle regiments in the British Army, The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles carry their battle honours on their drums, while the Royal Green Jackets also had theirs inscribed on their cap badge; this tradition is maintained by The Rifles, who wear the Maltese Cross badge of the Royal Green Jackets, inscribed with the regimental honours, as the belt badge. In place of a Regimental Colour, the Gurkhas carry the Queen's Truncheon.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, France {{refused to}} accept the idea that courts could quash {{legislation}} enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could a posteriori be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
500|$|Christians in Malaysia and Indonesia use Allah {{to refer}} to God in the Malaysian and Indonesian {{languages}} (both of which are standardized forms of the Malay language). [...] Mainstream Bible translations in the language use Allah as the translation of Hebrew Elohim (translated in English Bibles as [...] "God"). <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> early translation work by Francis Xavier in the 16th century. The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by Albert Cornelius Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 (revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 Latin-edition) recorded [...] "Allah" [...] as the translation of the Dutch word [...] "". Ruyl also translated Matthew in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after King James Version was published), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated Mark {{which was published in}} 1638.|$|E

Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
