5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional <b>transposase,</b> which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its <b>transposase</b> gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of <b>transposase.</b> Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E

25|$|While epigenetics is of {{fundamental}} importance in eukaryotes, especially metazoans, it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make {{widespread use of}} postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, <b>transposase</b> activity and regulation of gene expression. There exists a genetic switch controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could {{pave the way to}} improved vaccines. Each form is randomly generated by a phase variable methylation system. The ability of the pneumococcus to cause deadly infections is different in each of these six states. Similar systems exist in other bacterial genera.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} of DNA base flipping: active and passive. [...] In the active mechanism, an enzyme binds to the DNA and then actively rotates the base, {{while in the}} passive mechanism a damaged base rotates out spontaneously first, then is recognized and bound by the enzyme. [...] Research has demonstrated both mechanisms: uracil-DNA glycosylase follows the passive mechanism and Tn10 <b>transposase</b> follows the active mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including P element, Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element <b>transposase</b> and the other, the P transposon backbone. [...] The <b>transposase</b> plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|E
40|$|Background The <b>transposases</b> encoded by the IS 607 {{family of}} mobile {{elements}} are unusual serine recombinases with an inverted domain order and minimal specificity for target DNA. Results Structural genomics groups have determined three crystal {{structures of the}} catalytic domains of IS 607 family <b>transposases.</b> The dimers formed by these catalytic domains {{are very different from}} those seen for other serine recombinases and include interactions that usually only occur upon formation of a synaptic tetramer. Conclusions Based on these structures, we propose a model for how IS 607 -family <b>transposases</b> could form a synaptic tetramer. The model suggests that, unlike other serine recombinases, these enzymes carry out sequence-specific DNA binding and catalysis in trans: the DNA binding and catalytic domains of each subunit are proposed to interact with different DNA duplexes. The model also suggests an explanation for the minimal target DNA specificity. </p...|$|R

Our data indicate that reassortment of functional domains and horizontal transmission between species are involved in the formation and spread of new types of transposable elements...|$|R

One Zamilon ORF additionally shows some similarity to Mavirus, and another to Organic Lake virophage and a Phaeocystis globosa virophage, which are both associated with algae rather than amoebae. The remaining two predicted products show limited similarity to other known proteins. Putative functions of the products include <b>transposase,</b> helicase, integrase, cysteine protease, DNA primase–polymerase and DNA-packaging ATPase enzymes, major and minor capsid proteins, a structural protein and a collagen-like protein.

2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{location}} and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as Cre has been introduced. [...] Cre {{has proven to be}} a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). [...] While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the P element transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P insertions. Cre aids in the targeted transgenesis of the DNA gene segment of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites. [...] These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted transgenesis. [...] The Cre <b>transposase</b> is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.|$|E

40|$|Transposons of the Mutator (Mu) {{superfamily}} {{have been}} shown to {{play a critical role in}} the evolution of plant genomes. However, the identification of Mutator transposons in other eukaryotes has been quite limited. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized group of DNA transposons designated Phantom identified in the genomes of a wide range of eukaryotic taxa, including many animals, and provide evidence for its inclusion within the Mutator superfamily. Interestingly three Phantom proteins were also identified in two insect viruses and phylogenetic analysis suggests horizontal movement from insect to virus, providing a new line of evidence for the role of viruses in the horizontal transfer of DNA transposons in animals. Many of the Phantom <b>transposases</b> are predicted to harbor a FLYWCH domain in the amino terminus, which displays a WRKY–GCM 1 fold characteristic of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Mutator <b>transposases</b> and of several transcription factors. While some Phantom elements have terminal inverted repeats similar in length and structure to Mutator elements, some display subterminal inverted repeats (sub-TIRs) and others have more complex termini reminiscent of so-called Foldback (FB) transposons. The structural plasticity of Phantom and the distant relationship of its encoded protein to known <b>transposases</b> may have impeded the discovery of this group of transposons and it suggests that structure in itself is not a reliable character for transposon classification...|$|R

Piv tertiary structure is predicted to include the RNase H-like fold that typically encompasses the catalytic site of the recombinases or nucleases of the retroviral integrase superfamily, including <b>transposases</b> and RuvC-like Holliday junction resolvases. Analogous to the DDE and DEDD catalytic motifs of <b>transposases</b> and RuvC, respectively, four Piv acidic residues D 9, E 59, D 101, and D 104 appear to be positioned appropriately within the RNase H fold to coordinate two divalent metal cations. This suggests mechanistic similarity between site-specific inversion mediated by Piv and transposition or endonucleolytic reactions catalyzed by enzymes of the retroviral integrase superfamily. The role of the DEDD motif in Piv catalytic activity was addressed using Piv variants that are substituted individually or multiply at these acidic residues and assaying for in vivo inversion, intermolecular recombination, and DNA binding activities. The results indicate that all four residues of the DEDD motif are required for Piv catalytic activity.

PB <b>transposase</b> specifically recognizes PB inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon.
