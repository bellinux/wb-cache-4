However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 14thcentury, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to {{frequent}} Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated farther into the territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done. He won a major victory over the united Mongol <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.|$|E

He held a detachment of the 21st Infantry and 1st Cavalry, F Troop, in reserve to defend the howitzers.

5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kokoda Track had to {{be supplied}} from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War the Royalist Earl of Bath {{tried to}} raise troops in Cullompton but met {{resistance}} from local people. Troops passed through Cullompton on several occasions during the civil war: Sir Ralph Hopton rode with a small troop though the town {{on his way to}} Cornwall; Cornish Royalist forces marched through Cullompton on their way to join Prince Maurice at Chard as did The Earl of Essex and Thomas Fairfax. There were also <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets of Cullompton again in 1655 during Penruddock's Uprising.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result}} of the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent {{the bulk of his}} army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E

Lieutenant Colonel Dawson met with the German commander and a formal surrender was agreed and 900 prisoners were taken. Other Germans surrendered to some of the Royal Marine commandos at the same time. In the whole operation No. 4 Commando had suffered 13 dead, 21 wounded versus about 200 German dead and the capture of 1,200 prisoners and large amounts of weapons and equipment.|$|R
5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front line.

5|$|However, Béla, who {{actually}} {{had no intention}} of renouncing his claim to succeed his brother in favor of his nephew, fled to Poland and sought military assistance from Duke Boleslaus II of Poland (r. 1058–1079).

5|$|In {{all four}} Kentucky constitutions, the first power {{enumerated}} {{to the governor}} is to serve as commander-in-chief of the state's militia and military forces.

Such a case occurred in 1813 when Governor Isaac Shelby, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, was asked to lead a band of Kentucky troops to aid William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames.

5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms were largely {{of a single}} colour, such as the British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-General William Birdwood, {{commanding}} the inexperienced Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), comprising the Australian Division and two brigades of the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{was ordered to}} conduct an amphibious assault {{on the western side}} of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The New Zealand and Australian Division normally also had two mounted brigades assigned to it, but these had been left in Egypt, as it was believed there would be no requirement or opportunities to use mounted <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. To bring the division up to strength, Hamilton had tried unsuccessfully to get a brigade of Gurkhas attached to them. In total ANZAC strength was 30,638 men.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, at {{the start}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove. Included in the {{landings}} was the New Zealand and Australian Division, but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength, including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, behind in Egypt. The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and the lack of any other reinforcements, forced them to reconsider the decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.|$|E

To give {{themselves}} another major crossing over the Danube a plan by Baden to besiege {{the city of}} Ingolstadt with a force of 15,000 men was agreed to, despite leaving the Allied army numerically inferior. This army, totalling 52,000 men and now without the commander who led the Imperial <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Schellenberg, would meet the Franco-Bavarian forces, numbering 56,000 men, {{in and around the}} small village of Blindheim.
