5|$|Bombarding curium-242 with α-particles {{resulted}} in an isotope of californium 245Cf (1950), and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241. The new elements were named after Berkeley, California, by analogy with its lanthanide homologue <b>terbium,</b> which was named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling <b>terbium</b> and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide <b>terbium</b> with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with <b>terbium</b> (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|The monopnictides of berkelium-249 {{are known}} for the {{elements}} nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium(III) hydride (BkH3) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperatures (about 600 °C) under high vacuum in quartz ampoules. They crystallize in the cubic crystal system with the lattice constant of 495.1 pm for BkN, 566.9 pm for BkP, 582.9 for BkAs and 619.1 pm for BkSb.Bk monopnictides|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=42|issue=7|pages=995|year=1980|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(80)80390-3}} These lattice constant values are smaller than those in curium pnictides, but are {{comparable to those of}} <b>terbium</b> pnictides.|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and <b>terbium.</b> Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{berkelium}} dissolves {{in various}} aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent oxidation state (+3) {{is the most}} stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent (+4) and possibly divalent (+2) berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, <b>terbium.</b> Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with <b>terbium</b> fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, <b>terbium.</b> Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of <b>terbium,</b> californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and <b>terbium</b> were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the <b>terbium</b> group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and <b>terbium</b> were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the <b>terbium</b> group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
25|$|So in 1842 {{the number}} of known rare-earth {{elements}} had reached six: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, erbium and <b>terbium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The only tetrahalides known are the tetrafluorides of cerium, praseodymium, <b>terbium,</b> {{neodymium}} and dysprosium, {{the last}} two known only under matrix isolation conditions.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. Gadolinium becomes ferromagnetic at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – <b>terbium,</b> dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium – become ferromagnetic at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, higher-quality {{fluorescent}} lamps use either a higher-CRI halophosphate coating, or a triphosphor mixture, based on europium and <b>terbium</b> ions, which have emission bands more evenly distributed over {{the spectrum of}} visible light. High-CRI halophosphate and triphosphor tubes give a more natural color reproduction to the human eye. The CRI of such lamps is typically 82–100.|$|E
25|$|Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to {{separate}} the crude yttria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts erbium, and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide <b>terbium.</b> This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.|$|E
25|$|Discoverers of some {{elements}} named them after {{their home country}} or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium {{were based on the}} Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, <b>terbium,</b> erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium.|$|E
25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent <b>terbium,</b> and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as <b>terbium</b> and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander {{found that}} samples of yttria {{contained}} three oxides: white yttrium oxide (yttria), yellow <b>terbium</b> oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements were later isolated {{from each of}} those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, <b>terbium,</b> and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in [...] "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria {{was found to be}} a mineral and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.|$|E
500|$|In 1878, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac {{separated}} from the rare earth [...] "erbia" [...] another independent component, which he called [...] "ytterbia", for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called [...] "ytterbium" [...] (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, <b>terbium</b> and erbium). In 1907, the new earth [...] "lutecia" [...] was {{separated from}} ytterbia, from which the element [...] "lutecium" [...] (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name [...] "ytterbium" [...] was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma ray source.|$|E
500|$|The name {{choice for}} element 97 {{followed}} the previous {{tradition of the}} Californian group to {{draw an analogy between}} the newly discovered actinide and the lanthanide element positioned above it in the periodic table. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium, and curium honored scientists Marie and Pierre Curie as the lanthanide above it, gadolinium, was named after the explorer of the rare earth elements Johan Gadolin. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: [...] "It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley {{in a manner similar to}} that used in naming its chemical homologue <b>terbium</b> (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found." [...] This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, californium, was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium, but after the discovery place.|$|E
500|$|Organopraseodymium {{compounds}} {{are very}} {{similar to those of the}} other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo π backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric. The coordination chemistry of praseodymium is largely that of the large, electropositive Pr3+ ion, and is thus largely similar to those of the other early lanthanides La3+, Ce3+, and Nd3+. For instance, like lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium, praseodymium nitrates form both 4:3 and 1:1 complexes with 18-crown-6, whereas the middle lanthanides from promethium to gadolinium can only form the 4:3 complex and the later lanthanides from <b>terbium</b> to lutetium cannot successfully coordinate to all the ligands. Such praseodymium complexes have high but uncertain coordination numbers and poorly defined stereochemistry, with exceptions resulting from exceptionally bulky ligands such as the tricoordinate [...] There are also a few mixed oxides and fluorides involving praseodymium(IV), but it does not have an appreciable coordination chemistry in this oxidation state like its neighbour cerium.|$|E
500|$|It is a dopant in {{some types}} of glass in lasers and other {{optoelectronic}} devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on {{the composition of the}} host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green <b>terbium</b> phosphors give [...] "white" [...] light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.|$|E
2500|$|Aerogels {{made with}} {{aluminium}} oxide {{are known as}} alumina aerogels. These aerogels are used as catalysts, especially when [...] "doped" [...] with a metal other than aluminium. Nickel–alumina aerogel {{is the most common}} combination. Alumina aerogels are also being considered by NASA for capturing hypervelocity particles; a formulation doped with gadolinium and <b>terbium</b> could fluoresce at the particle impact site, with the amount of fluorescence dependent on impact energy.|$|E
2500|$|Cerium forms a {{stoichiometric}} dioxide, CeO2, where cerium has an {{oxidation state}} of +4.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} which were discovered {{as a consequence}} of the lengthy analysis and breakdown of the ore Gadolinite.
