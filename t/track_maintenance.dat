5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E

25|$|Over {{very long}} {{timescales}} (perhaps millions of orbits), even small perturbations can dominate, and the behaviour can become chaotic.

25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} worthwhile to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines.

After running a bus in direct competition with the railway in 1930, the railway's passenger service was withdrawn at the beginning of 1931. While the GWR did not relish owning another Welsh narrow gauge line, they did perform some <b>track</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and on at least two occasions the rolling stock was repainted.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 2010s, Amtrak {{had planned to}} fix the deteriorating rails and {{infrastructure}} around Penn Station, but due to the prioritization of other projects, applied only minimal fixes. In early 2017, this culminated in numerous power outages, derailments, and delays due to <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> delays. There were frequent service disruptions to train schedules caused by the deterioration of its tracks and their supporting infrastructure, {{as well as in}} those of the East River and North River tunnels that respectively connect the station to Long Island and New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|The {{existing}} {{service is}} approaching {{the end of}} the operational life of its ICTS fleet; as trains are no longer built to that line's specification, a replacement is needed. While an upgraded form of ICTS (Mark II Vehicles designed by Bombardier) had been considered, the current recommendation is to implement the LRT/tram technology used for Transit City to save on the fleet and <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs currently incurred by this unique-within-Toronto system.

25|$|During most of {{the ensuing}} merger process, Rock Island {{operated}} at a financial loss. In 1965, Rock Island would earn its last profit. With the merger with Union Pacific seemingly so close, the Rock Island cut expenses to conserve cash. Expenditures on <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> were cut, passenger service was reduced {{as fast as the}} ICC would allow, and locomotives received only basic maintenance to keep them running. Rock Island began to take on a ramshackle appearance and derailments occurred with increasing frequency. In an effort to prop up its future merger mate, UP asked the Rock Island to forsake the Denver gateway in favor of increased interchange at Omaha. Incredibly, the Rock Island refused this and the UP routed more Omaha traffic over the Chicago and North Western.|$|E
25|$|Firsby was a {{junction}} for the Skegness {{line and}} the Spilsby line on their short branches from the main GNR London to Cleethorpes railway. During the summer months holiday passenger traffic, from throughout the country alighting at Firsby for the connection to Skegness, was substantial with hundreds and sometimes thousands of passengers passing through the station at a weekend. In the Victorian era most holidaymakers travelled by train and Firsby {{was one of the}} busiest stations on the East Lincolnshire Railway. The station was the major employer in the area and between the station master and his assistants, ticket office staffs, ticket inspectors, signalmen, porters, catering staffs, drivers, firemen, guards and <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> staff for three separate railway companies, several hundred people worked at, or from, Firsby station on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|With Network Rail's (NR) Fairwater Yard <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{facility}} {{is a short}} distance east of Norton Fitzwarren. Due to {{the high costs of}} ballast disposal from the site, NR approached the railway about using the triangle site as a commercial recycling site, allowing reclaimed ballast {{to be used in the}} local construction industry. After gaining planning permission from Somerset County Council, and approval of a drainage plan from the Environment Agency (conditions of which stipulate that the site must be fully reverted to meadow pasture at the termination of ballast recycling operations) the WSRA came to an agreement with NR to utilise spent ballast and rail from their track renewals programme. NR maintenance trains occasionally run from Fairwater Yard to Norton Fitzwarren to drop off spent materials at the site. A commercial operator sorts the ballast under contract to the WSRA.|$|E

40|$|Ergonomic {{analyses}} of the railway field highlight concepts which guide the analysis of collective work. These concepts have been constructed through observation of two risky work processes in the field: rail <b>tracks</b> <b>maintenance</b> and maintenance operations in the electrical device of traffic regulation. Co-action, co-activity, collaboration and co-operation differentiate collective interactions which need coordination and negotiation. The occupational risk management is characterized by connections and regulations on horizontal and vertical levels. Nevertheless, even if ergonomic studies show how collective work should be a safety and a performance criterion they also show how some conditions and lack of safety cannot be recovered. An effective form of prevention should take into account results of this type...|$|R
