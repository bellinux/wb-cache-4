5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more <b>tektite</b> glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E

25|$|Povenmire {{and others}} have {{proposed}} {{the existence of an}} additional <b>tektite</b> strewn field, the Central American strewn field. Evidence for this reported <b>tektite</b> strewn field consists of tektites recovered from western Belize {{in the area of the}} villages of Bullet Tree Falls, Santa Familia and Billy White. This area lies about 55nbsp&km east-southeast of Tikal where 13 tektites, two of which were dated as being 820,000 years old, of unknown origin were found. A limited amount of evidence is interpreted as indicating that the proposed Central American strewn field likely covers Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and possibly parts of southern Mexico. It is speculated that the hypothesized Pantasma Impact Crater in northern Nicaragua might be the source of these tektites.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Twenty seven <b>tektites</b> {{from the}} Wenchang area, Hainan {{province}} (south China) and five <b>tektites</b> from the Khon Kaen area (northeast Thailand) were analyzed for major and trace element contents and Rb-Sr isotopic compositions. All the samples studied are splash-form <b>tektites.</b> <b>Tektites</b> {{of this study}} are characterized by high SiO 2 contents ranging from 71. 95 to 74. 07 wt % which is consistent with previously published analyses of Australasian <b>tektites.</b> The trace element ratios Ba/Rb (avg. 3. 89), Th/Sm (avg. 2. 40), Sm/Sc (avg. 0. 45), Th/Sc (avg. 0. 99) and the rare earth elements (REE) contents of <b>tektites</b> {{of this study are}} similar to the average upper continental crust. Based on the chemical composition, it is suggested that <b>tektites</b> in this study are derived from similar parental material and are similar to the post-Archean upper crustal rocks. The major and trace element abundances of <b>tektites</b> analyzed indicate that the parental material of <b>tektites</b> may be a terrestrial sedimentary deposit. The <b>tektites</b> from th...|$|R

This helped establish that <b>tektites</b> were produced in meteorite impacts.

40|$|Oxygen isotope {{analyses}} {{were obtained for}} six Ivory Coast <b>tektites,</b> two samples of Bosumtwi Crater glass, and two new moldavites. The Ivory Coast <b>tektites</b> are 2 to 5 per mil richer in oxygen- 18 than other known <b>tektites,</b> and they are similar in oxygen- 18 content to the impactite glass from the nearby Bosumtwi Crater. These data are compatible with a terrestrial origin for the Ivory Coast <b>tektites...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} in water content {{can be used}} to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses will turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a <b>tektite</b> will produce only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.|$|E
25|$|The ages of tektites {{from the}} four strewnfields have been {{determined}} using radiometric dating methods. The age of moldavites, a type of <b>tektite</b> found in Czech Republic, {{was determined to be}} 14 million years, which agrees well with the age determined for the Nördlinger Ries crater (a few hundred kilometers away in Germany) by radiometric dating of Suevite (an impact breccia found at the crater). Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the Lake Bosumtwi Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrestrial}} {{source for}} tektites {{is supported by}} well-documented evidence. The chemical and isotopic composition of tektites indicates that they are derived from the melting of silica-rich crustal and sedimentary rocks, which are not found on the Moon. In addition, some tektites contain relict mineral inclusions (quartz, zircon, rutile, chromite, and monazite) that are characteristic of terrestrial sediments and crustal and sedimentary source rocks. Also, {{three of the four}} <b>tektite</b> strewnfields have been linked by their age and chemical and isotopic composition to known impact craters. A number of different geochemical studies of tektites from the Australasian strewnfield concluded that these tektites consist of melted Jurassic sediments or sedimentary rocks that were weathered and deposited about 167 Ma ago. Their geochemistry suggests that the source of Australasian tektites is a single sedimentary formation with a narrow range of stratigraphic ages close to 170 Ma more or less. This effectively refutes multiple impact hypotheses.|$|E

50|$|From the 1950s {{through the}} 1990s, NASA {{aerodynamicist}} Dean Chapman and others advanced the lunar origin theory of <b>tektites.</b> Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests {{to support the}} theory that the so-called Australasian <b>tektites</b> originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of Tycho. Until the Rosse ray is sampled, a lunar origin for these <b>tektites</b> cannot be ruled out.|$|R
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form <b>tektite</b> into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|E

40|$|Small glassy pebbles, called <b>tektites,</b> {{are found}} in widely {{scattered}} locations around the world. These <b>tektites</b> appear much like volcanic glass obsidian, but their chemical composition {{is different from that}} of any terrestrial lava and they contain far less water and none of obsidian's characteristic microcrystals. No one has ever found the mother lode of a field of <b>tektites.</b> They cannot, therefore, be the product of terrestrial volcanism. Recently acquired knowledge about the moon's surface confirms earlier indications that <b>tektites</b> cannot be bits of lunar soil propelled to the earth by the impact of meteorites on the moon. According to one of two remaining possibilities <b>tektites</b> are bits of terrestrial sedimentary rock excavated by meteorites striking the earth's surface, melted by the heat of impact, and congealed into glass as they travel above the atmosphere to the scattered sites where they are found. The other possibility is that <b>tektites</b> are the remains of gobs of lava fired at the earth by volcanic activity on the moon...|$|R
25|$|Although <b>tektites</b> are superficially {{similar to}} some {{terrestrial}} volcanic glasses (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, {{they are completely}} glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in silica (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of <b>tektites</b> is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and {{quite different from the}} bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, <b>tektites</b> contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within <b>tektites</b> often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few <b>tektites</b> contain partly melted inclusions of shocked and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. quartz, apatite, and zircon, as well as coesite.|$|R
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of <b>tektites</b> requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} <b>tektites</b> is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of <b>tektites.</b> Any mechanism by which <b>tektites</b> are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which <b>tektites</b> were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for <b>tektites</b> to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|R
2500|$|Though the {{meteorite}} impact theory of <b>tektite</b> formation is widely accepted, {{there has been}} considerable controversy about their origin in the past. In contrast to a terrestrial impact source for tektites, it was argued that tektites consist of material that was ejected from the Moon by major hydrogen-driven lunar volcanic eruptions and then drifted through space to later fall to Earth as tektites. The major proponents of the lunar origin of tektites include NASA scientist John A. O'Keefe, NASA aerodynamicist Dean R. Chapman, meteorite and <b>tektite</b> collector Darryl Futrell, and long-time <b>tektite</b> researcher Hal Povenmire. From the 1950s to the 1990s, O'Keefe argued for the lunar origin of tektites based upon their chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk, composition and physical properties. Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests {{to argue that the}} so-called Australasian tektites originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of the large crater Tycho on the Moon's nearside. O'Keefe, Povenmire, and Futrell claimed on the basis of behavior of glass melts that the homogenization, which is called [...] "fining", of silica melts that characterize tektites could not be explained by the terrestrial-impact theory. They also argued that the terrestrial-impact theory could not explain the vesicules and extremely low water and other volatile content of tektites. Futrell also reported the presence of microscopic internal features within tektites, which argued for a volcanic origin.|$|E
