2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather.

2500|$|In the United Kingdom it {{is illegal}} to carry a folding knife having a blade more than 3 inches (just over 7.6cm) in length in public without [...] "good reason". The terms [...] "in public" [...] and [...] "good reason" [...] are not defined, but {{examples}} of [...] "religious duty", [...] "national dress" [...] and [...] "requirement of employment or hobby" [...] are given. [...] It is left up to a police officer's individual subjective discretion, and ultimately a magistrate to decide if a knife is being carried [...] "in public", and for a [...] "good reason". [...] Folding knives with blades of [...] or less may be carried without needing to provide [...] "good reason" [...] so long as the blade is not capable of being locked in the open position. However, {{it is illegal}} to have the intention of using any object in public as a weapon, meaning that even a knife that is legal to carry without needing [...] "good reason" [...] may still be found to be illegal if the police officer has grounds to suspect it will be used as a weapon. The onus lies on the officer to prove that intent. [...] Recent court decisions in the U.K. have made it easier for public prosecutors to obtain knife possession convictions by preventing the accused from citing self-defence or even fear of attack as a justifiable reason for carrying a knife.

25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware.
