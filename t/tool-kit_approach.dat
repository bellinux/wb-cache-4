5000|$|Like Champions, it uses <b>tool-kit</b> <b>approach</b> to {{creating}} effects. While {{the system does}} have more typical features of many RPGs, such as a skill system, most abilities in the Hero System rules are listed as a generic [...] "powers". Most powers {{are meant to be}} able to model a vast number of potential effects. When creating a character, a player decides on what effect they wish to create, then constructs this effect by consulting the powers in the rulebook. Most powers have a set of modifiers that alter its base performance to more finely-tune its representation of the effect desired. Each such modifier makes the power more or less capable, and correspondingly more or less expensive to purchase with character points (the [...] "currency" [...] used to buy powers; see the section following). The result is that many effects are possible from the exact same base power. For example, while systems such as Dungeons & Dragons would list a wide variety of separate ranged attack powers that deal damage (such as a fireball, a lightning bolt, an acid spray, a magic missile, and dozens more), the vast majority of such effects in the Hero System would be constructed out of the same base two powers, [...] "Blast" [...] or [...] "Killing Attack".|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{population}} in Hong Kong, the government has been formulating different policies including housing, social and transport services to cope with the situation. Undoubtedly one of the major concerns arising from increase of population is road traffic congestion problem. If no appropriate measures are to be taken, the effect would be very detrimental, which not only affect the general public living but also the whole economy of Hong Kong. As such, the congestion problem has been seriously addressed by the government since the early era with numbers of traffic-related policies formulated which aims at alleviating the congestion problem in the whole territory in Hong Kong. Over the past decades, transport services have been expanded in many aspects so as to cope with the ever-increasing population demand as well as to relieve the congested situation. Relieving traffic congestion measures has always been a heated topic in the policy agenda in the government, as well as within the society. Over the past years, the HKSAR had been drawing a number of traffic-related policies to solve the congested problem especially at those black spots. Also while working closely with different public transport stakeholders, more diversified regulations or traffic management measures have also been launched. In this dissertation, the traffic congestion problem and the traffic congestion management measures are the main subjects for discussion. On examining the effectiveness of the policies concerned, a <b>Tool-kit</b> <b>approach</b> will be adopted. Each policy will be addressed under the five policy tools which are used as the basics for reviewing the traffic policies and traffic management measures formulated by the government from the previous decades till the current stage. The 5 chosen Policy Tools are Direct Government; Economic and Social Regulation; Corrective Taxes; Contracting; and Information. The effectiveness of those measures will be further evaluated based on the five criteria: Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity; Manageability; and Political Legitimacy. Over the past decades, transport services have been expanded in many aspects so as to cope with the ever-increasing population demand as well as to relieve the congested situation. The measures appear to be effective, but there seems to be room for further improvement. Apart from the relieving measures to be discussed, there are still numbers of alternative proposals that can help to alleviate the congestion problem in Hong Kong. One is the adoption of the Electronic Road Pricing System and the other alternatives include better utilization of the RHCs and control the numbers of vehicles on roads. While most of the relieving measures carried out in the past are considered to be effective, that would not be enough as in view of the increasing population, It’s time for the government to take into account other alternatives that are considered to be effective options in solving the congestion problem. While adopting or implementing any of the proposed option requires considerable preparation works and timing, the government should take an active and swift approach without delay. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for supporting inquiry learning from source materials, realised and tested through a <b>tool-kit.</b> The <b>approach</b> is optimised for tasks {{that require a}} student to make interpretations across sets of resources, where opinions and justifications {{may be hard to}} articulate. We adopt a dialogue-based approach to learning whereby the student creates an external representation to reflect their current understanding of the task. This in turn prompts immediate feedback, designed to help the learner to see patterns or irregularities in their current perspective. Through the on-going feedback, the student is encouraged to make incremental changes to achieve a coherent outcome. In this approach, learners are encouraged to generate meaningful responses for themselves, rather than relying on feedback which explicitly provides an answer. This is aimed at prompting deeper processing and understanding of source materials {{in the context of the}} given learning goal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{following}} we report about an interdisciplinary project between arts, engineering and business students, which acronym is called ARTEM (ARTEngineeringManagement) workshop. This ARTEM workshop initiates undergraduate students to Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), {{by way of}} the ISO 26000 guidelines. It is built on a partnership with a regionallybased Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) which manufactures and exports “Made in France” top-ofthe range cookware worldwide. It takes place in English thus attracting business, engineering and arts students from different cultural backgrounds keen on improving their organizational CSR strategy design and implementation as well as language skills. Students actively engage in developing CSR analyses and solutions for the SME which, without external support, {{would not be able to}} address such an ambitious program. Teaming host and international visiting students together foster cross-cultural comparisons of views, interpretations and solution finding. Students are encouraged to move from the abstract to the concrete through a playful modelling <b>approach</b> (<b>tool-kit</b> based serious game), reflecting results with the company. This live case workshop responds to the search for a unique experiential learning seminar by the participating institutions of the ARTEM collaboration in Nancy (under the leadership of ICN Business School) and Western University in London, Ontario. The authors see the contribution of this paper by introducing the methodological approach and particularly the focus of embedding creative methodology in a curriculum which includes a direct interaction as a cross cultural team in professional practice. They also provide some first explorative results of the application of the methodology. The innovation of this ARTEM workshop is the unique combination of learning techniques that allow students to learn Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). By having access to an ongoing real company situation, embracing a team teaching approach, promoting students` cultural diversity through teamwork, and using metaphorical modelling methods and playful interaction through tool-kit based modelling, this session promoted student engagement and co-learning...|$|R
