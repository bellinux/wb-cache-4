50|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} of these factors, and affects the mix viscosity, acting <b>to</b> <b>plasticize</b> the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as wet extrusion, but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability. The most important rheological factor in the wet extrusion of high-starch extrudate is temperature.|$|E

All the polymers are pink-coloured viscous fluids. They were characterized by inherent viscosity, density, IR, H- 1, C- 13 and P- 31 NMR spectroscopy.

Film casein content most influenced initial RSA, while increasing casein level resulted in an apparent decrease of RSA due to quenching. During storage, a good stability of RSA was observed. The surface antioxidant activity is of primary interest for food contact materials; a decrease in film surface RSA occurred during the first 20 days of storage, followed by an increase in surface RSA during the remainder of the 90 -day storage period, especially at high relative humidity.

40|$|A new optical polymer-based sensor was developed, {{which is}} able to {{recognize}} amines in organic solvents with high sensitivity. Thin polymer membranes were prepared and investigated, which contain a chromogenic functional dye (reactand) that shows a significant colour change during a reversible chemical reaction with the analyte. For that purpose the azo dye 4 -trifluoroacetyl- 4 ?-[N-(methacryloxyethyl) -N-(ethyl) amino]-azobenzene (CR- 465) was synthesized, which contains a trifluoroacetyl moiety (receptor for interaction with amines) and in addition, a polymerizable methacrylate group. The methacrylate group links the dye covalently to the polymer matrix and the receptor recognizes the analyte via covalent binding. For immobilisation of the dye cross-linked methacrylate polymers with different composition were used. The highly cross-linked polymer network was stable against most organic solvents and exhibited enhanced stability against mechanical strain compared <b>to</b> <b>plasticized</b> PVC.

40|$|Di (2 -ethyl hexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) {{is one of}} {{the main}} plasticizers used in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) medical devices and is currently the only one listed for use in the European Pharmacopoeia Monograph. It leaches out of PVC when the material is in contact with lipophilic media, for example, blood and certain nutritional feeds. Consequently, concerns have been expressed since in certain animal species, DEHP has been shown to exhibit both carcinogenic and reproductive toxic effects. Incorporation of beta cyclodextrin (BCD) and hydroxypropyl betacyclodectrin (HPBCD) into plasticized materials has been reported to decrease the leaching of DEHP. We have investigated whether this results in improved in vitro biocompatibility by measuring the responses of U 937 cells <b>to</b> <b>plasticized</b> PVC in the presence and absence of added BCD or HPBCD. Growth and viability of the U 937 cells, as well as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) production in contact with these materials revealed no significant difference between unmodified plasticized PVC materials and those containing BCD or HPBCD. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to elicit TNF- production, and the response of cells to LPS in the presence of the PVC materials was evaluated. When PVC was modified by addition of HPBCD there was a significant reduction in the TNF- production in response to LPS. Modification of plasticized PVC biomaterials by adding cyclodextrins did not significantly improve their biocompatibility. However, the HPBCD modified plasticized PVC materials caused a reduction in the production in TNF- induced by LPS which may have implications for the inflammatory potential of these biomaterials...|$|R

In particular, bagasse as a waste stream in sugar or ethanol production from sugar cane reaches annual quantities of 200 million tons only in Brasil. In {{the present paper}} two ways of utilizing this source of lignocellulose are considered: chemical modification, i. e. esterification and etherification of the entire bagasse {{on the one hand}} and use of bagasse as a filler in thermoplastic composites with polyolefin matrix, in particular LDPE. While the latter approach resembles the wood plastic composite (WPC) manufacture, the former is similar <b>to</b> <b>plasticizing</b> chemical pulp by esterification to obtain cellulose acetate and other (mixed) esters. On the WPC route, filler loads of up to 8 0 % were reached while maintaining tensile strength, increasing modulus up to more than five times the starting value reaching 3 GPa and increasing HDT from 45 to 105 °C. On the down side, tensile elongation at break and Charpy impact were reduced. For chemical bagasse modification acetylation, propionylation, mixed esterification as well as benzylation were investigated. With the right choice of reaction conditions and catalyst, and using common, low-cost chemicals (not, e. g., ionic liquids) thermoplastic materials could be obtained which adjustable mechanical properties in the range of polyolefins. Tensile elongations tend to be low, but with the appropriate choice of plasticizer and substitutent type and amount, 10 to 20 % could be realized. Both approaches are capable of utilizing the bagasse waste stream for manufacturing thermoplastic materials for extrusion or injection molding. While WPC may figure as a somewhat obvious option, the chemical modification opens up a new variety of (partially) bio-based plastics on the commodity side...|$|R
