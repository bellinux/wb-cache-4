Chinese rarely had <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount}} of their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E

The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew {{transferred}} Béla from Slavonia to Transylvania in 1226. In Slavonia, he was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Coloman. As Duke of Transylvania, Béla adopted an expansionist policy {{aimed at the}} territories over the Carpathian Mountains. He supported the Dominicans' proselytizing activities among the Cumans, who dominated these lands. In 1227 he crossed the mountains and met Boricius, a Cuman chieftain, who had decided <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> Christianity. At their meeting, Boricius and his subjects were baptized and acknowledged Béla's suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.|$|E

By contrast, in classical PKU (without dihydrobiopterin involvement), prolactin levels would be relatively normal.|$|R

5|$|Why Æthelberht chose <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>to</b> Christianity is uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E

As earlier in the century, so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for the conversion of Armenians and Zoroastrians, focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in the spice export, for example, was well known.|$|E
