50|$|Based on the {{original}} Basel Accord, under the Standardised Approach, banks’ activities are divided into eight business lines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage. Within each <b>business</b> <b>line,</b> gross income is a broad indicator {{that serves as a}} proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale of operational risk exposure within each of these <b>business</b> <b>lines.</b> The capital charge for each <b>business</b> <b>line</b> is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that <b>business</b> <b>line.</b> Beta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience for a given <b>business</b> <b>line</b> and the aggregate level of gross income for thatbusiness line.The total capital charge is calculated as the three-year average of the simple summation of the regulatory capital charges across each of the <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> in each year. In any given year, negative capital charges (resulting from negative gross income) in any <b>business</b> <b>line</b> may offset positive capital charges in other <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> without limit.|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{estimate}} future annual cash flow of an insurance company. Data of three main different <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> {{of the company}} are used to predict the next year cash flow. The individual <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> are modelled by Gamma, Pareto and lognormal distributions. Daily payments were correlated and therefore the joint distribution of the <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> was found. As the model the skew t-copula introduced in Kollo, Pettere (2009) was used. Simulation from the joint distribution was carried out to predict the next year cash flow. The obtained results were compared with the case when the dependencies between the <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> were not taken into account. Presented model gives stochastic approach for future payments...|$|R

Researchers often track these modifications at multiple levels through survey questions posed to key employees or executives involved in an acquisition.

40|$|Sustainability is {{probably}} {{the ultimate goal of}} any entrepreneur when initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge ‒ many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business – therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one <b>business</b> <b>line</b> or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new <b>business</b> <b>lines</b> is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing <b>business</b> <b>lines,</b> their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new <b>business</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
