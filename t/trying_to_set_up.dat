5|$|Harrison, Scott and Mitchell soon {{developed}} a mutual rapport, according to L.A. Express bassist Max Bennett. In addition to carrying out further sessions for Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles, in March 1974, Harrison had begun spending time there <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> his own record label, with the winding {{down of the}} Beatles' Apple Records from mid 1973 onwards. In August 1973, rumours {{in the music industry}} claimed that Harrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Paul Simon were forming a label together; in fact, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records, one of the first releases of which was the Shankar album, and Dylan temporarily signed with David Geffen's Asylum Records, which was Mitchell's label.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when {{a number of the}} safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E

25|$|Brussels Airlines began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a {{regional}} airline in DR Congo in 2007. DR Congo {{used to be}} Belgian Congo and has strong business and political ties with Belgium. In that year, airDC was founded as {{a joint venture with}} Hewa Bora Airways, and the launch of commercial regional flights from Kinshasa-N'djili Airport using a fleet of BAe 146-200s handed over by Brussels Airlines was planned for early 2008. Concerns about the success of the project were voiced in 2008, when the disaster of Hewa Bora Airways Flight 122 revealed serious aviation safety flaws in the DR Congo. As a consequence, Hewa Bora was banned from operating within the European Union (any air carriers from the DR Congo had already been included in the EU blacklist since 2006 due to a lack or regulatory oversight in the country, but there had been an exception for Hewa Bora's Brussels service). The airDC project was postponed indefinitely and eventually abandoned.|$|E

The U.S. State Department, White House officials, and Rodman all denied any official government involvement in the visit. Rodman, who publicly endorsed Trump during the 2016 Presidential Campaign, is a self-described longtime friend of the president and, as the article put it, [...] "Trump and Kim’s only mutual acquaintance." [...] The Washington Post article stated, [...] "Multiple people involved in unofficial talks with North Korea say that the Trump administration has been making overtures toward the Kim regime, including <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a secret back channel to the North Korean leader using 'an associate of Trump’s' rather than the usual lineup of North Korea experts and former officials who talk to Pyongyang’s representatives." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1755 Gage's {{regiment}} {{was sent}} to North America as part of General Edward Braddock's expeditionary force, whose objective was the expulsion of French forces from the Ohio Country, territory disputed between French and British colonies where there had been military clashes in 1754. On this expedition Gage's regiment was {{in the vanguard of}} the troops when they came upon a company of French and Indians who were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an ambush. This skirmish began the Battle of the Monongahela, in which Braddock was mortally wounded, and George Washington distinguished himself for his courage under fire and his leadership in organising the retreat. The commander of the 44th, Colonel Sir Peter Halkett, was one of many officers killed in the battle and Gage, who temporarily took command of the regiment, was slightly wounded. [...] The regiment was decimated, and Captain Robert Orme (General Braddock's aide-de-camp) levelled charges that poor field tactics on the part of Gage had led to the defeat; {{as a result of his}} accusations Gage was denied permanent command of the 44th Regiment. [...] Gage and Washington maintained a somewhat friendly relationship for several years after the expedition, but distance and lack of frequent contact likely cooled the relationship. [...] By 1770, Washington was publicly condemning Gage's actions in asserting British authority in Massachusetts.|$|E

After that, however, they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records with the plan of pursuing a new musical direction. They decided to pursue the funk genre but the record company was not happy with their musical abilities, hence they were dropped, and Madonna and Bray left the band. Meanwhile, Madonna had written and developed some songs on her own.
