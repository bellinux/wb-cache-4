Taking various communities—including online communities—as <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as [...] "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" [...] or [...] "association"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft {{is perceived to be}} a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a [...] "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the early development and pilot-testing of Project IMPACT, a case management intervention {{for victims of}} stalking. The Design and Development framework (Rothman 2 ̆ 6 Thomas, 1994) {{was used as a}} guide for program development and evaluation. Nine research questions examined the processes and outcomes associated with program implementation. ^ The sample included all 36 clients who participated in Project IMPACT between February of 2000 and June of 2001, as well as the victim advocates who provided them with services. Quantitative and qualitative data were drawn from client case files, participant observation field notes and interview transcriptions. Quantitative data were entered into three databases where: (1) clients were <b>the</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (n = 36), (2) services were <b>the</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (n = 1146), and (3) goals were <b>the</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (n = 149). These data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Chi-square, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s Rho, Phi, Cramer 2 ̆ 7 s V, Wilcoxon 2 ̆ 7 s Matched Pairs Signed-Ranked Test and McNemar 2 ̆ 7 s Test Statistic. Qualitative data were reduced via open, axial and selective coding methods. Grounded theory and case study frameworks were utilized to analyze these data. ^ Results showed that most clients noted an improved sense of well-being and safety, although residual symptoms of trauma remained for numerous individuals. Stalkers appeared to respond to criminal and civil justice-based interventions by reducing violent and threatening behaviors; however, covert behaviors continued. The study produced findings that provided preliminary support for the use of several intervention components including support services, psycho-education, safety planning, and boundary spanning. The psycho-education and safety planning in particular seemed to help clients cognitively reframe their perceptions of the stalking experience and gain a sense of increased safety and well-being.

5000|$|Activity Theory {{is a broad}} social {{sciences}} approach to understanding human behavior as contextualized in a situation. This situated perspective expands <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> to the collective rather than individual and studies the relation between actions. Although this approach is aimed at understanding the individual, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> is the broader system in which that individual participates. Engestrom identifies three generations of activity theory and associated researcher: first generation, a model focused on the individual (subject-object-mediating artifact) by Lev Vygotsky (1978); second generation, expansion of the model to include collective action, by Alexei Leont'ev (1981); and third generation, toward a networked understanding of interactive activity systems, proposed by Engestrom himself (1987). Another Activity Theory scholar, Barbara Rogoff expands this work in two ways: first, foregrounding of the individual must be done without losing sight of the interdependence of the system; and second, there are three different levels of resolution (interpersonal, cultural/community, and institutional/cultural planes) are needed to understand the different levels activity. A distributed perspective on leadership takes this networked and multi-level approach to give [...] "context of action" [...] and [...] "maintain... the tension between agency and distribution.|$|E
