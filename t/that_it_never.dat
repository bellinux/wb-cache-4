5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E

The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws, the pool size was miscalculated and was less than an inch too narrow to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> held the competitions the council had hoped for and it {{spent much of the}} 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified.|$|E

5|$|On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was {{so badly}} damaged in the raid <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid {{resulted}} in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both {{the gay and lesbian}} community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.|$|E
5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
5|$|Barbirolli's {{interest}} in new music waned in post-war years, {{but he and}} the Hallé appeared regularly at the Cheltenham Festival, where he premiered new works of a mostly traditional style by William Alwyn, Richard Arnell, Arthur Benjamin, Peter Racine Fricker, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Kenneth Leighton and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several new works, including Walton's virtuosic divertimento Partita. Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory of the standard symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he {{made a series of}} international tours with the Philharmonia (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> proved possible to take the Hallé {{on a tour of the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari's {{strategy}} for {{staying in the}} championship battle saw them introduce upgrades to the F2012 at every remaining race in the season, starting with an extensive revision for the Indian Grand Prix, but whatever advantage they offered was still not enough for Fernando Alonso to catch Sebastian Vettel. Vettel dominated the weekend, setting the fastest time in every practice session before qualifying on pole, and leading every lap of the sixty-lap race, though he was denied his third Grand Chelem when Jenson Button set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap. Fernando Alonso finished second, conceding another seven championship points to Vettel. The Ferrari driver rounded up both McLaren drivers {{at the start of}} the race and proceeded to chase down Mark Webber for second, only overtaking the Australian on the long back straight when his car developed a KERS fault fifteen laps from the end <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> recovered from. Webber held off a late challenge from Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium. Further down the order, Kimi Räikkönen finished seventh after spending most of the race trapped behind Felipe Massa, and later claimed that mistakes on Saturday had robbed him of a podium on Sunday, while Pedro de la Rosa retired from the race when he suffered a brake failure that saw him spin into the barriers at Turn 4. The race was marked by a series of explosive punctures after cars made light contact with one another; Michael Schumacher's right-rear tyre deflated on the first lap when he made contact with Jean-Éric Vergne at the first corner; Sergio Pérez suffered a puncture under similar circumstances when he glanced Daniel Ricciardo's front wing, with the loose rubber damaging the floor of Pérez's car enough that he was forced into retirement; and Pastor Maldonado also had a tyre punctured when he and Kamui Kobayashi touched at speed on the approach to Turn 5, forcing the Venezuelan to run wide onto the tarmac run-off, but suffering no lasting damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{line was}} built in its current form: a branch from Watford to St. Albans. However, the line was at times {{connected}} to two other lines.

Mostly a local route, {{the construction of the}} Midland main line ensured <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>never</b> became popular with the critical market of passengers to London. It closed to passengers in 1951, part of a cutback of minor routes after the war. The whole route closed to goods in 1964, though a short stub at the Hatfield end lasted until 1968.|$|E
25|$|The Mk. VIII {{spawned a}} number of variants, notably the AI Mk. IX which {{included}} a lock-on feature to ease interceptions.

During the late-war period, many UK aircraft adopted the US SCR-720 under the name AI Mk. X. This worked along the same general principles as the Mk.

IX would eventually briefly re-appear in greatly advanced form as the AI.17 during the 1950s.|$|E
