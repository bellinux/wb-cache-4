5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage {{was obtained from}} Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{was active}} again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major {{eruption}} in 1918â€“1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was {{topped by a}} lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually {{gave way to the}} construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.|$|E

As the drawing below shows the cone had distinctive appearance at the time. Over time the cone's shape changes because of the layers of mineral deposited in successive eruptions.|$|R

5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than {{they need to be}} for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

25|$|There are eleven {{pairs of}} equally spaced holes (60mm in diameter) near the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the sheer line. Close {{analysis}} of those holes {{showed no signs}} of any intensive wear or fitting marks inside them so their purpose is still a mystery.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E

This presumably Victorian or Edwardian feature would take people across to the area delineated by a small ha-ha, now thick with rhododendrons (R.ponticum), typically planted by estate owners.|$|E

25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently into the cup (the scoop), and she then runs her index finger along the inside <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E

The ground is made up of yellow horizontal lines on a brown background, and the sky is coloured with the bokashi technique of colour gradation, darkening from light grey to black as it reaches the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the print. Osome looks up to her left with an uneasy facial expression, her gaze resting somewhere beyond the right border of the print.|$|E
25|$|Various {{ornaments}} of {{the nasal}} boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus.

P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion {{of the nasal}} boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.|$|E

40|$|Transport {{and optical}} {{properties}} of random networks of c-axis oriented wedge-shaped GaN nanowalls grown spontaneously on c-plane sapphire substrates through {{molecular beam epitaxy}} are investigated. Our study suggests a one dimensional confinement of carriers at the <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> these connected nanowalls, which results in a blue shift <b>of</b> the band <b>edge</b> luminescence, a reduction of the exciton-phonon coupling, and an enhancement of the exciton binding energy. Not only that, the yellow luminescence in these samples {{is found to be}} completely suppressed even at room temperature. All these changes are highly desirable for the enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of the material. More interestingly, the electron mobility through the network is found to be significantly higher than that is typically observed for GaN epitaxial films. This dramatic improvement is attributed to the transport of electrons through the edge states formed at the <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the nanowalls. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

25|$|The NGA {{hired the}} {{structural}} engineering firm Robert Silman Associates {{to determine the}} cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved {{to the center of the}} <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored silicone gaskets installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the faÃ§ade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the bouncer {{can be a}} very {{productive}} ball for the batsman, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.|$|E

25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E
25|$|To {{see that}} the Petersen graph has no Hamiltonian cycle C, {{consider}} the edges in the cut disconnecting the inner 5-cycle from the outer one. If there is a Hamiltonian cycle, an even number of these edges must be chosen. If only {{two of them are}} chosen, their end-vertices must be adjacent in the two 5-cycles, which is not possible. Hence 4 of them are chosen. Assume that the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cut is not chosen (all the other cases are the same by symmetry). Of the 5 edges in the outer cycle, the two top edges must be chosen, the two side edges must not be chosen, and hence the bottom edge must be chosen. The top two edges in the inner cycle must be chosen, but this completes a non-spanning cycle, which cannot be part of a Hamiltonian cycle. Alternatively, we can also describe the ten-vertex 3-regular graphs that do have a Hamiltonian cycle and show that none of them is the Petersen graph, by finding a cycle in each of them that is shorter than any cycle in the Petersen graph. Any ten-vertex Hamiltonian 3-regular graph consists of a ten-vertex cycle C plus five chords. If any chord connects two vertices at distance two or three along C from each other, the graph has a 3-cycle or 4-cycle, and therefore cannot be the Petersen graph. If two chords connect opposite vertices of C to vertices at distance four along C, there is again a 4-cycle. The only remaining case is a MÃ¶bius ladder formed by connecting each pair of opposite vertices by a chord, which again has a 4-cycle. Since the Petersen graph has girth five, it cannot be formed in this way and has no Hamiltonian cycle.|$|E
500|$|The preacetabular (i.e. {{located in}} front of the hip socket) process of the ilium bears a {{horizontal}} [...] "boot" [...] which forms an obtuse angle with the bottom of the process. Additionally, the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bone projects outwards to form a rim located above the ilium-ischium articuation on the bottom edge of the bone. These traits are also seen in Probactrosaurus and other iguanodonts. The hip socket itself is quite large relative to the ilium for an iguanodont. A distinctive flange is present along the top surface of the ilium, a trait which is shared with an unnamed hadrosauroid from the Woodbine Formation. The postacetabular (i.e. located behind the hip socket) process of the ilium tapers at its rear with no break in its top margin. On the pubis, the forward-projecting process expands towards the front, like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts. The shaft of the ischium is characteristically straight in adults (juveniles have a curved shaft, which is more common among iguanodonts), and the bottom of the shaft bears a compressed [...] "boot" [...] that is expanded forwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Micro {{abrasive}} air jet (MAAJ) cutting {{technology is}} being increasingly {{used in the}} precision machining of hard and brittle materials, due to its distinct advantages of negligible heat effect zone and small cutting force.

It shows that the <b>top</b> kerf <b>edge</b> is straight but not sharp. The <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> definition <b>of</b> the kerf improves with {{a decrease in the}} air pressure, while the effect of abrasive flow rate and nozzle traverse speed are hardly discernible. The optimum jet incidence angle for highest <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> definition <b>of</b> the kerf is 60 Â°.
