5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} {{forced the}} railroad <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened {{to take the}} company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square. Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building {{in the middle of}} 1929.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the air base and {{link up with}} troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area. A military spokesman said that {{government forces}} were massing in Samarra and would soon make another push to capture Tikrit. Meanwhile, south of Tikrit, the army managed to recapture the town of Mukayshifah in fighting that an army spokesman claimed killed 40 ISIS fighters.|$|E

5|$|Residents began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the centre}} into the {{suburban}} areas which {{were included in}} Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970. As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981. It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004. In 2010 Odense had a population of 166,305 people. As of 2017 it had a population of 176,683.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their reserve areas. This {{was followed by the}} establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E

Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.|$|E
5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range. She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E

5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built. In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, {{the first time since}} 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E

Moore wished to marry Walter although their relationship had begun to deteriorate, while Parks and Moore created competing workout DVDs after plans to make the project a joint venture proved unsuccessful. Toward the end of the season, Williams attempted to revive her failing marriage to Stewart with therapist sessions.|$|E

5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the family home. He {{was concerned that}} Green, {{who had never been}} a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
