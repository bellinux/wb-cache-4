These systems can be powered by high-efficiency fuel cells that operate at 60 - 65 % and utilize hydrogen and oxygen electrolyzed from water. However, one of the major challenges that prevent these probes and robots from performing long duration surface exploration and science is thermal design and control. In the inner solar system, during the day time, there is often enough solar-insolation to keep these robots warm and power these devices, but during eclipse the temperatures falls well below storage temperature.

In ammonia-based solar <b>thermochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> systems, the stored energy is released when the hydrogen (H 2) and nitrogen (N 2) react exothermically to synthesize ammonia (NH 3), providing thermal energy to a power block for electricity generation. But ammonia synthesis {{has not yet been}} shown to reach temperatures consistent with the highest performance modern power blocks (~ 650 ï¿½C). The following dissertation addresses an ongoing investigation into {{the field of}} ammonia based <b>thermochemical</b> energy <b>storage.</b> In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, the state of the art of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) and <b>Thermochemical</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> (TCES) are reviewed. In the second part, a two-dimensional model is proposed to simulate heating supercritical steam in an ammonia synthesis reactor. Thirdly, the model is validated as the model predicted temperature profiles match with experimental measured results well. A sensitivity analysis is carried out for the model to study the effects of six input parameters on heat transfer and reaction kinetics. The results show the process is “heat-transfer-limited” and most sensitive to activation energy. The process is also very sensitive to inlet ammonia mass fraction. Improving heat transfer and decreasing inlet ammonia mass fraction are crucial to improve the capability of the reactor to heat steam. In the fourth part, some preliminary designs for ammonia synthesis systems are proposed. Parametric studies are made with the model for each component in the proposed systems. The systems are optimized and investigated to minimize the total tube wall volume per unit power. The result shows that improving heat transfer by small dimensions and subdividing the reactor into different sections for different steam temperature ranges are good for minimizing the tube wall volume for the system. Also, it is necessary to optimize the entire system simultaneously since the wall volume for each component is comparable.

The intermittence of the solar resource would be overcome by integrating an energy storage system. Compared to sensible or latent heat storage, <b>thermochemical</b> <b>storage</b> presents the advantage of having higher energy density, being capable to store energy as long as desired at ambient temperature and the option of transporting the storing material to generate heat at the end-use location. One route for <b>thermochemical</b> <b>storage</b> is based on metal oxides redox reactions. Here, thermal energy is stored in chemical form during the endothermic reduction and it is released during the exothermal oxidation, generally at a different temperature level. Some chemical reactions proceed at temperatures high enough to operate heat engines at high efficiency, as in electricity generation. In addition, heat is recovered at essentially isothermal conditions, which gives advantage to process controllability.

In the case of air-operated Solar Thermal Power Plants such cascades can consist of porous structures incorporating different redox pair oxide materials that can come in direct contact with the air stream used as heat transfer fluid and operate as compact, hybrid sensible-thermochemical storage modules in series.

Salt hydrates present the highest energy densities, but their main drawback is their bad compatibility with some container materials, such as metals. To control the corrosion effect it is necessary to perform and evaluate experimental tests. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} show experimental results of corrosion test between the most used salt hydrates for <b>thermochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> and the most common vessel metals...|$|R
