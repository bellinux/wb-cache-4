Both the N = 8 and N = 7 algebras admit unitary highestweight representations {{in terms of}} a single boson and free fermions in 8 of Spin(7) and 7 of G 2, with the central charges c 8 = 26 / 5 and c 7 = 5, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the general coset Ansätze for the N = 8 and N = 7 algebras naturally lead to the coset spaces SO(8) × U(1) /SO(7) and SO(7) × U(1) /G 2, respectively, as the additional consistent solutions for certain values of the central charge. The coset space SO(8) /SO(7) is the seven-sphere S 7, whereas the space SO(7) /G 2 represents the sevensphere with <b>torsion,</b> <b>S</b> 7 T. The division algebra of octonions and the associated triality properties of SO(8) play an essential role in all these realizations. We also comment on some possible applications of our results to string theory. 1 Supported in part by the ‘Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ’ and the ‘Volkswagen Stiftung...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} there are {{homotopy}} equivalences h: N → M between closed manifolds which are induced by cell-like maps p: N → X and q: M → X but which are not homotopic to homeomorphisms. The phenomenon is based on construction of cell-like maps that kill certain L-classes.

In the case of simply connected M with finite π 2 (M), the subgroup S CE (M) coincides with the odd torsion in S(M). For general M, the group S CE (M) admits a description {{in terms of the}} second stage of the Postnikov tower of M.

By SGA 4 XIV, for any {{constructible}} sheaf F of Z/nZ-modules on X, the sheaves of Z/nZ-modules R^if_*F obtained by direct image (for the etale topology) are also constructible: {{there is a}} stratification of S on whose strata these sheaves are locally constant constructible. After previous work of N. Katz and G. Laumon, or L.

Circular-dichroism spectroscopy indicates an overall B-like conformation for the decamer, but stronger than usual base stacking. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the N 1 H groups of the mismatched guanine residues are not hydrogen bonded, and 31 P-NMR showed the presence of BII phosphate conformations for the GpA steps.

40|$|Background. The {{transmural}} {{distribution of}} fiber angles {{and the extent}} of shortening among obliquely oriented fibers are likely to be major determinants of the twisting motion that accompanies left ventricular (LV) ejection. As such, measurements of torsion may provide useful information about LV contractile function, but other factors, such as ventricular loading conditions, may also regulate this motion. Methods and Results. <b>Torsion</b> angles (0 <b>s)</b> of midventricular and apical regions were measured relative to a reference minor axis near the base in seven human cardiac allografts from biplane radiographic images of metallic midwall markers. Pressure loading with methoxamine (5 - 10 gk/kg/min) increased LV end-systolic pressure by 41 ± 14 mm Hg (p< 0. 0001). Volume loading with normal saline raised LV end-diastolic pressure from 9. 9 ± 5. 2 to 19. 6 ± 4. 9 mm Hg (p< 0. 0001). These alterations in LV loading conditions were associated with no change in Oi (difference not significant) for any marker site. Inotropic stimulation with dobutamine (5,ug/kg/min) increased values of Oi by as much as twofold (p< 0. 05); this response varied considerably depending on marker location, with the middle and apical inferior wall and the apical lateral wall being the most sensitive. When the marker site associated with the largest torsion angle (Omax) was considered in each patient, dobutamine increased 0 max in all case...|$|R

Theorem 1 Let S ⊂ X 0 (N) (¯ K) be an infinite set of points corresponding to elliptic curves which all lie in one isogeny class, but which are not isogenous to E itself.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{problem in}} the algebraic geometry of varieties of dimension n ^ 3 over an algebraically closed field k has been whether there exist unirational varieties which are not rational. Here V is unirational if it has the equivalent properties: (a) there exists a rational surjective map /: V n-> V, or, there exists an embedding k(V) V, or, there exists an isomorphism k(V) = k(Xv [...] ., 1 ^). For n— these are equivalent (Liiroth's theorem). For n = 2 they are equivalent in characteristic 0 (Castelnuovo's theorem) or if the map / in (a) is assumed separable (Zariski's extension of Castelnuovo's theorem). In 1959 ([13]), Serre clarified classical work on this problem for n = 3. It has been generally accepted since then {{that none of the}} examples proposed by Fano or Roth had been correctly proved irrational. In the past year, two solutions of this problem have been found: Clemens and Griffiths ([6]) showed that all non-singular cubic hypersurfaces in P 4 are irrational, and Iskovskikh and Manin ([16]) showed that all non-singular quartic hypersurfaces in P 4 are irrational. Some are unirational (Segre ([11])). Both of these solutions are quite deep and it seems worth while to have an elementary example as well, even if our method applies to a very special kind of variety. Ramanujam suggested using <b>torsion</b> in H <b>s</b> and this led us to the examples presented here.

40|$|The f irst part of {{the study}} deals with an i mproved {{softened}} membrane model for the analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) circular bridge columns under pure torsio n loading. The e xistence of torsion severely affects the structural performance of RC member especially at times where torsion is the primary load action in structural elements like b rid ge columns, outrigger bents etc. In this study, shortcomings of the hi therto models present in the literature are addressed by suitably incorporating the necessary effects that are otherwise ignored. T he i mpact of the strain gradient effect and bi - directional stresses on the torsional response is significant. This study fill s th e knowledge lacuna exist in this vital area of research by pr esenting a modi fied softened membrane model (SMMT) for circular columns under torsional loading by incorporating these effects. The proposed model also recommends a new tension stiffening rel ationship model of concrete for better predictions. Outcomes of the proposed model are also compared with classical rotating angle softened truss model (RA - STM) to illustrate the supremacy of the proposed model. Parameters such as post cracking stiffness, peak torque and corresponding twist are better captured by the i mproved SMMT compared to RA - STM. In addition to this work, th e model has been extended to FRP strengthened RC members wherein analytical and finite element (FE) studies are conducted to invest igate the behavior of FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) composite strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams under torsional loading. The p resence of <b>torsion</b> severely affect <b>s</b> the behavior and failure pattern of the members. Therefore, it is imperative to und erstand the efficiency of F RP strengthening under torsion al loading to ensure safe design. The proposed vi model is improvised (SMMT - FRP) by incorporating the effects of FRP composites on the compressive behavior of cracked concrete. The analytical study is s upported by a full - scale nonlinear finite element (FE) study using commercial package ABAQUS. The p arameters such as post cracking stiffness, peak torque and corresponding twist are passabl y ca ptured by the improved SMMT - FRP. It is learnt that, FRP strengt hening augmente d the post - cracking stiffness, ultimate strength and localized the damage. In the second {{part of the}} study, e xisting FEM based fiber beam element model for RC members subjected to c ombined loading is investigated and part of the work is pres ented in this stu d y. In all practi cal cases, RC members are typically subjected t o one or more types of loading and existence of one load influence s the behavior of other load s. This study envisages at understanding the behavior of RC members modeled as no nlinear beam elements under combined loading.
