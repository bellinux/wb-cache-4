500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ... Even Madonna never did that to girls." [...] Aguilera told Blender in response to the criticism: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001 King's College London {{acquired}} the building from the Crown Estate and appointed a design {{team led by}} Gaunt Francis Architects to oversee the renovation. The renovation took two-years, {{at a cost of}} £35m. During the works, two rare painted zinc ceilings from the 1860s (one forms part of the ceiling of the round reading room and another is located above the lobby entrance) and a fine 1901 tessellated floor were discovered. Former president of RIBA, Maxwell Hutchinson commented on the project, [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one of the best marriages between an important redundant building and a new use I've come across in a very long time." [...] The library was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2002, and the project received the 2003 City Heritage Award. The library was named after Sir Deryck Maughan, an alumnus of King's, who together with Lady Maughan made a £4m donation towards the new university library. It is the largest new university library in Britain since World War II.|$|E
