The purpose was to investigate in which machine, the harvester or the forwarder, that caused most damage to the trees in six different stands. Different factors, related to the damage frequency in the stands, were checked out. For example: basal area per hectare, thinning strength, tree diameter {{and the rate of}} production. The harvester drivers were also interviewed about how, when and why stem damages occur and how to minimize them. The study stated that 4. 3 percent of the trees were damaged.

These simulations {{may be used to}} optimize the way the forest is used and to evaluate new machine concepts in forestry. The Python library for discrete event simulation, SimPy, was chosen as the foundation for the tool. The developed tool can handle spatial objects such as moving machines, trees and boulders. Support for continuous linear movements was also added, which has resulted in a model that partially overlaps continuous and discrete event simulations without any additional computational costs. The result is simulations of a forest with machines operating in it. Two pilot simulations, one of a <b>thinning</b> <b>machine</b> and one of a planting machine, were performed with useful results. The new simulation tool shows promising properties. Limitations and improvements are discussed, with the conclusion that continued development is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{investigate}} and compare the difference between stand-thinning <b>machines</b> and strip-road <b>thinning</b> <b>machines,</b> and how they affect the stand on behalf of future growth, theoretical economic result, wind impact, snow pressure and density of stand. The investigation is regarding the first commercial thinning of pine stands, after pre-commercial thinning that was well conducted. The investigation area was located near Katrineholm, Sweden. The measurements that were measured were strength of thinning and amounts of wind throws, snow-breaks and hauling damages. The results that emerged, was that <b>thinning</b> with strip-road <b>machines</b> had a significantly higher strength of thinning over all, {{as compared with the}} stand- <b>thinning</b> <b>machines</b> (45 percent versus 30 percent). Comparisons between wind-throws, snow-breaks and hauling damages of the stand could not establish any {{significant differences between the two}} methods that were investigated. Conclusions, over all, were that if forest owners want to have more timber volume left for second thinning and final cut of the stand, the forest owners should choose the method with stand-thinning machines. From the point of view of gentle treatment of the stand and ground damages the choice should be the same. However, the method with strip-road <b>thinning</b> <b>machines</b> is the most common and accessible method in Sweden. Most likely it is the most economical way to manage the stand for forest owners in present time. If the method with stand-thinning machines is becoming more common in Sweden, it is suggested for forest owners to consider the stand-thinning method as a candidate for treatment due to economic aspects...|$|R

The aim of the work where to investigate the economical result of removing undergrowth trees before first thinning, and a follow-up of the contractors and their compliance with Mellanskog standards. This thesis work was divided in three parts: The first {{was to find a}} relation between the net volume from the first thinning and the cost of cleaning undergrowth trees. Secondly there was a follow-up in the field, to investigate whether the contractors have done the undergrowth cleaning according to Mellanskog’s directives. The last part of the assignment was an inquiry examination to both <b>thinning</b> <b>machine</b> contractors and cleaning contractors, including interviews with some of them. One hypothesis, which we shared with our assigner (Mellanskog), was that all contractors didn`t follow the directives. According to the directive all obstructive undergrowth up to 8 cm diameter in breast height (1, 3 meters above the ground) should be removed. Trees with a breast height diameter < 8 are common in first thinning stands after cleaning, which is unprofitable for all links of the forest supply chain.

Crop thinning {{is one of the most}} important stages in row crop production which is laborious and costly. The objective of this project is design and construction of a row crop <b>thinning</b> <b>machine.</b> Four main system units are plant sensors, ground sensors, control and thinning platforms. In this machine the unwanted plants on the rows are randomly removed by employing a pneumatically system. A blade on a vertical arm with pendulum motion removes the plant from the rows. The machine control system consists of an arm and a blade which is activated by a double acting cylinder and equipped with a relay and a timer. The pneumatic cylinder is controlled via a solenoid valve. Laboratory tests were conducted to validate the machine performance. Some other preliminary tests also were performed for optimization of parameters such as cinematic index and cutting length of blades. The laboratory tests (totally 9 tests) were performed with a constant forward speed and three levels of plant density, using artificial plants. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results show that satisfactory performance of the machine is achieved when the plant density is moderate i. e. the thinning performance reduces with higher plant distance in the row. The other effective variable on machine performance is the adjustment of sensor sensitivity, which is used to distinguish between week and strong plants. In general the machine performance is sensitive to plant shape and morphology, plant distribution pattern in the field, growing stage of the plants, time of thinning and the effectiveness of previous weeding operation...|$|E

This includes three major {{areas of research}} that will enable highly automated process planning; a critical need for a rapid methodology. The first research area yields a model for automatically determining the locations of layers, given the slab height, material types and part geometry. Layers are chosen such that it will avoid catastrophic failures and poor machining conditions in general. First, features that are possible <b>thin</b> material <b>machining</b> positions are defined, and methods for detecting these feature positions from an STL model are studied. Next, a layer thickness calculation model is presented according to positions of these features. The second area focuses on tools and parameters for the subtractive side of processing each layer. A tool size and machining parameter selection model is presented that can automatically select tool sizes and machining parameters, given layer thickness, part geometry, and material types. Machining strategies and related machining parameters are studied first. Then the method for Stepdown parameter calculation is presented. Finally, an algorithm based on both accessibility and machining efficiency is proposed for the selection of tool sizes for the rough cutting operation, finish cutting operation and optional semi-rough cutting operation. The final research area focuses on a cutting force analysis for <b>thin</b> material <b>machining</b> with additional layer thickness 2 ̆ 6 tool size interaction. Popular cutting force models are reviewed, and a suitable model for cutting force calculation in this process is evaluated. Then, a cantilever beam model is {{used to analyze the}} <b>thin</b> material <b>machining</b> failure problem, and a minimum layer thickness model is presented.

This study aims at developing a multispectral vision sensor to detect the floral buds of the pear cultivar Conference. By combining the information from a limited number of wavebands in the range 400 - 1000 nm, discrimination can be made between floral buds and branches. In this paper, the selection of a combination of these wavebands is explained. Hyperspectral scans were taken from tree samples to create a database of reflectances for the different tree components. From this pool a stepwise algorithm selected a combination of six wavebands with a significant high discriminating power between the components of interest. When using these six bands, more than 95 % of the (pixel) observations could be correctly classified. For practical implementation of the sensor, it is interesting to use as few wavebands as possible. For this reason the discrimination performance was checked as a function of the number of used wavebands.
