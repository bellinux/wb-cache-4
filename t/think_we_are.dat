25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} Who Do We <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for Who Do We <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are,</b> to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E

On Australia's win he said, [...] "It's not that we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> ahead of the others. It's just the way we play." [...] Nevertheless, he complimented both teams by saying that India and Australia were the two best teams in the tournament, and said that the Indian players {{deserved}} to be in the final. Ganguly praised the Australian batsmen and said that they played like [...] "real champions".|$|E

500|$|On January 23, 2007, Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins made a {{statement}} that may have set the rivalry in a dead heat: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{the team to beat}} in the NL East… but that's only on paper." [...] Many Mets fans and players laughed at the prediction, especially once the Phillies stumbled out of the gate in April, starting the season at 1–6 and posting an 11–14 record for the month. The Mets, meanwhile, sat firmly in the NL East lead for almost all of the season.|$|E
500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said {{to allow us to}} more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E

Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I try to do that in the words and music and try to be what people don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E
500|$|Several of Jackson's songs {{have been}} leaked onto the Internet without gaining an {{official}} release. One example involved the song [...] "A Place with No Name", a 24-second snippet {{of which was}} leaked by website TMZ.com following Jackson's death in 2009. At {{the time of the}} leak, it was claimed that there were [...] "hundreds" [...] of unreleased songs by the musician, and that they could be issued for several years to come. Commenting on the subject, the curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, noted that any future releases would garner significant attention. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." [...] On March 16, 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a record-breaking $250million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017 and release ten posthumous albums—some of which will feature unreleased material—over the next decade.|$|E
500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend. Many players routinely worked on their conditioning and strength together, in addition to [...] "informal" [...] on field training. A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season {{and that is what we}} are here for. We are here to get better individually and collectively and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers.

500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want you to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{comeback}} {{was confirmed}} when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown {{that would last}} until 19 October, when the girls would make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled [...] "Something New", leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, [...] "It's here! The finished version of Something New will be played on radio from midday and will also be on YouTube to listen in full." [...] "Something New" [...] was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, [...] "I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back or not.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do We <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E

I really respect what she's been doing lately and would definitely be open to a collaboration!" [...] On 18 October 2014, Inna uploaded a video on her YouTube channel called [...] "New Music Preview (2014)", where she teased six upcoming songs, including a demo version of [...] "We Wanna", which incorporated some modified lyrics, and did only feature Inna's vocals. Particularly, it was revealed that the track has been originally composed for her, but she accepted offering the recording to Stan, in order to relaunch her in the music industry. About their collaboration, the latter singer stated that, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> like a delicious vanilla-chocolate milkshake, which you simply cannot get enough from." [...] "We Wanna" [...] was made available for digital download on 8 June 2016—near Stan's birthday on 10 June—through Roton, Fonogram and Global Records. Besides of being featured on Stan's third studio album, Alesta (2016), the song was also added to the track list of some editions of Unlocked (2014) and Inna (2015).|$|E
500|$|Mckinsey's Managing Partner, Dominic Barton {{issued a}} statement, {{following}} an internal investigation, {{in which the}} firm [...] "admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian." [...] This statement was rejected {{by a number of}} civil society organisations and opinion makers.. [...] Eusebius McKaiser, a radio talk show host and former Mckinsey employee said, of Bartons' statement in an article headlined [...] "Why Mckinsey is not Innocent", that [...] "I sometimes wonder whether corporations <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a bunch of fools incapable of seeing excrement for what it is." [...] The Daily Maverick published an article entitled [...] "Curious and Curiouser: McKinsey’s astonishing attempt at self-exoneration" [...] in which journalist Pauli van Wyk wrote that [...] "McKinsey’s “investigation” found nothing more to say about its dealings with Eskom and the Gupta-linked company Trillian than what the firm has already admitted to.". [...] The Financial Mail, a weekly financial magazine, published an editorial strap-lined [...] "McKinsey's tone deaf fudge" [...] entitled [...] "McKinsey: Would I lie to you?" [...] describing the list of excuses provided by Barton in his statement as improbable and that the statement did not go nearly far enough to explain how Mckinsey and Trillian earned R1.6bn in 6 months without a lawful contract. [...] The article went on to describe Mckinsey's behaviour as being, if not corruption, then certainly greed and profiteering.|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever.
