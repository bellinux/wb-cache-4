5|$|After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who {{requested}} {{an address to}} send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers to were told that, despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a post-office box mailing address for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning {{when she told him}} of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Nikolić {{left his}} post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then {{returned}} to the headquarters, and announced that talks with the Germans for an armistice has started and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any need for action. He also redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E

50|$|To {{home in on}} {{the source}} of this {{reconstruction}} of gender equality, Schüssler Fiorenza turns to one of Paul's core theological verses, :There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> Jew or Greek, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> slave or free, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.|$|R

5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any danger that a wood engraver {{could change the}} character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed {{for the application of}} a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a {{business}} requirement {{to remain in}} Albuquerque so Microsoft wanted to relocate to a larger city {{that would be more}} attractive to new employees. The San Francisco bay area was considered but Allen and Gates decided to return home to Seattle. Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.|$|E

5|$|Whatever Tiberius's motives, the {{withdrawal}} was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius {{were still in}} their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of princeps survive.|$|E
5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog {{closed in on}} the {{mountain}} top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen. One of the engineers was shot through the neck and Vandygriff {{sent him to the}} company command post, only to have the man return to report that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a command post, that he could not find anyone and had seen only North Korean dead. Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{convened a}} meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was {{selected}} as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization. The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any need for mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 {{the naval}} {{situation}} in the Pacific had eased {{to a large extent}} due to the sinking of the Emden, and it was decided that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a need to maintain guards on many of the less important facilities, and instead it was decided to concentrate the home defence network upon maintaining the coastal defences and on guarding ships while they were in port. Nevertheless, in the larger seaports these precautions required the commitment of considerable resources, requiring several hundred men to provide security. The requirement for the militia to undertake these duties was eased, however, when a special corps was raised from men that had been rejected for service with the AIF, to which a corps of garrison military police that had served in the AIF was added later.|$|E

5|$|In January 1906 Tiku sent scouts to Sidareng and Sawitto, {{which the}} Dutch were invading, to observe {{their way of}} battle. When the scouts {{reported}} of the Dutch forces' overwhelming strength and seemingly magical powers used against the Bugis soldiers, he ordered his fortresses to increase readiness and begin stocking up on rice; that month, Luwu fell to Dutch forces, who then moved further inland. In February Tiku's men, sent to reinforce the southern kingdoms, reported that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> coherent leadership and that both kingdoms were losing against the Europeans. This convinced Tiku to train more troops and form a nine-member military council, with himself as its leader.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the coastal area between Pascagoula, Mississippi and the Suwannee River in Florida. A tropical storm warning for the region between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Apalachicola, Florida replaced the watch, though it was discontinued east of Apalachicola. All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 UTC on September14, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a need for the advisories. After the landfall, officials issued flood watches for inland parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well as for western portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. On Dauphin Island in Alabama, some residents boarded up windows and filled sandbags provided by local fire departments to prepare for Hanna. The Red Cross opened 10 shelters throughout the Gulf Coast region.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Armoured Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade. The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

5|$|The current {{paper mill}} building, whose water wheel {{is powered by}} a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II listed building. The {{commercial}} production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur yard, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house of mirrors and penny arcades.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{outbreak}} of plague in 1451, {{and there are no}} surviving records of him after Christmas of that year. On 16August 1451 the council of Meersburg was informed by officials in Cologne that Lochner would be unable to attend to the will and estate of his parents, recently deceased. It is presumed he was by then already ill; plague was widespread in the area. On 22 September Saint Alban parish requested permission to burn victims in the lot next to his house <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> room in their cemetery. Lochner died sometime between this date and December 1451 when creditors took possession of his house. Records from 1451 do not mention Lysbeth, who was presumably already dead.|$|E
5|$|More actions {{took place}} on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; {{together}} Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed {{in the vicinity of the}} Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm. Mack was now in a dangerous situation: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Treuchtlingen on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards Neustadt an der Donau and captured 12,000 Austrians.|$|E
