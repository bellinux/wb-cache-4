Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E

5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E

5|$|In 1359 the Black Prince {{gave the}} advowson to four patrons (or feofees), who, on 7 November 1360 {{appropriated}} {{the church to}} the Cistercian Vale Royal Abbey, Chester, founded by King Edward I in 1270. <b>The</b> <b>appropriation</b> was confirmed 28 November 1360 by Thomas Fastolf, Bishop of St David's (a canon lawyer). The ancient church, with its dependent chapels of Castell Gwallter, Llanilar and Llanfihangel y Creuddyn, again became subordinate to another religious house. Thereafter the abbot and convent of Vale Royal became the corporate rector until 1538, with Llanbadarn Fawr left {{in the hands of}} a vicar.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam and his {{advisers}} did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E

5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1975, Whitlam {{intended}} {{to call a}} half-Senate election {{in an attempt to}} break the deadlock. When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority in the election held the following month.|$|E

5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. <b>The</b> <b>appropriation</b> did not cure the fair's {{financial}} woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|Western Christianity, {{particularly}} {{through its}} monasteries, {{was a major}} factor in preserving classical civilisation, with its art (see Illuminated manuscript) and literacy. Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c.480–543), {{one of the founders of}} Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as St Columbanus and St Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> bills {{approved}} by both Houses, {{they were sent}} over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them Royal Assent.

5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. <b>The</b> <b>appropriation</b> was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed <b>the</b> <b>appropriation.</b> The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and <b>the</b> <b>appropriation</b> of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E
