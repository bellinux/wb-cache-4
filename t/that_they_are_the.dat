5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Marziana, a Baghdad-based dancer, is {{abducted}} by the tyrant Sher Khan, {{commander of the}} notorious king Amir Kasim Khan, to his palace. She is rescued by Alibaba, an impoverished woodcutter who fights with Sher Khan and vanquishes him. Marziana and her sidekick Dowlath find refuge in Alibaba's house who lives with his sister Ayisha and servant Bulbul. Marziana learns <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> siblings of Kasim, who had driven them out at the instigation of his cruel wife Salima. Marziana and Alibaba later fall in love.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} an extension to the London Underground at Hobbs End dig up skeletal remains. Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney (James Donald) is called in and deduces <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants of a}} group of five-million-year-old apemen, more ancient than any previous finds. One of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object. Believing it to be an unexploded bomb, they call in an army bomb disposal team.|$|E

5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half a dozen of them were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
5|$|Each season, one American League (AL) team {{wins the}} pennant, {{signifying}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> league's champion {{and have the}} right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League. The pennant was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the American League Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current American League pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2017.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences from Australian collections labeled Macrolepiota konradii, M.gracilenta, M.mastoidea, and M.procera has shown <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same species as Macrolepiota clelandii. Similarly, several New Zealand collections were historically misidentified as Macrolepiota dolichaula. These names, given originally to European species, were erroneously applied to Australian collections. Else Vellinga subsequently emended the species concept of Macrolepiota clelandii to include specimens with four-spored basidia and pale fruitbody colouring. Phylogenetically, M.clelandii is in a clade with {{closely related species}} such as M.procera, M.dolichaula, and M.mastoidea. This clade is sister to a group containing Leucoagaricus and Leucocoprinus species. The presence of clamp connections in the hyphae place M.clelandii in the section Macrolepiota of genus Macrolepiota.|$|E

5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Shawn and Gus {{are locked}} in the library and it is lit on fire, but they are rescued by Father Peter Westley (Ray Wise). Bob, who is {{revealed}} to be Paula's biological father, explains that after World War I, his great-grandfather established the town with two other soldiers, intending to create a secluded utopia. After the sawmill fire in 1958, the town began {{to look at all}} outsiders as a threat. When Doc Gooden and Sheriff Jackson enter and hold him at gunpoint, Shawn deduces <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> leaders of the other two founding families. Due to Gooden's infertility and Jackson's terminal cancer, Randy was the only known direct descendant and therefore the sole future leader. To stop Randy from leaving town with a paranoid Paula, the sheriff and doctor drowned her. After Lassiter and O'Hara arrive and arrest Gooden and Jackson, the group celebrates at the diner, only to be repulsed by a number of oddities referencing Twin Peaks.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard is an {{archipelago}} in the Arctic Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but {{is subject to}} the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} of <b>the</b> buildings <b>were</b> left to <b>the</b> {{owners of the}} buildings, but <b>the</b> façades <b>were</b> strictly regulated, to ensure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> same height, color, material, and general design, and were harmonious when all seen together.|$|R
2500|$|Reading the angel's {{blessing of}} Hagar in [...] Professor Lewis B. Smedes, {{formerly}} of the Fuller Theological Seminary, taught that just because God chose Abraham and Sarah did not mean <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only ones whom God chose.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "ladies" [...] <b>were</b> {{typically}} <b>the</b> {{older women}} workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior {{that might be}} interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ladies. <b>The</b> consequences for the [...] "ladies" [...] <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> targets of {{the least amount of}} come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.|$|R
5|$|The agents {{interview}} Tony Fiore, the ex-partner of Morris, who attributes Morris' {{death to}} a triad gang {{they had been}} investigating together. Later that day, Fiore meets with a Leon Felder, and the two discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box, but agree that they haven't waited the ten years they had intended to, ominously discussing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> last two claimants left. That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, as the bus drives off. The driver tries to brake, but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate, strangling Felder as Michelle watches from inside the bus.|$|E
5|$|The {{number five}} {{is also found}} in the {{structure}} of the poem itself. Sir Gawain is 101stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees {{to have lunch with}} Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals that he is the father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
5|$|The Gazel Ministry {{uses the}} Gaetia Key, an {{artifact}} that manipulates the DNA of {{massive amounts of}} humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful Gear called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other. They learn <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan {{around the time of}} the war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the Mother, who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated.|$|E
