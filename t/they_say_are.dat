25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>are</b> just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> described in medieval and early modern texts. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Adherents {{believe that}} the {{deported}} Israelites became Scythians/Cimmerians who <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> ancestors of the Celts/Anglo-Saxons of Western Europe. The theory arose in England, from whence it spread to the United States. During the 20th century, British Israelism was promoted by Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God. The Worldwide Church of God no longer teaches the theory, but some offshoot churches such as the Philadelphia Church of God, the Church of God, an International Community, the Church of God, a Worldwide Association, United Church of God and the Living Church of God continue to teach it. [...] One notable adherent of British Israelism was Alberta premier [...] "Bible Bill" [...] Aberhart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series has}} been noted for its {{relatively}} sympathetic portrayal of the aristocratic family, and the class-based society of early 20thcentury Britain. This has led to criticism from the political left and praise from the right. James Fenton wrote in The New York Review of Books [...] "it is noticeable that the aristocrats in the series, even {{the ones who are}} supposed to be the most ridiculous, never lapse into the most offensive kind of upper-class drawl one would expect of them. Great care has been taken to keep them pleasant and approachable, even when the things <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> sometimes shown to be class-bound and unfeeling." [...] Jerry Bowyer argued in Forbes that the sympathy for aristocracy is over-stated, and that the show is simply more balanced than most period dramas, which he believes have had a tendency to demonise or ridicule upper class characters. He wrote that Downton Abbey shows [...] "there is no inherent need for good TV to be left of center. Stories sympathetic to virtue, preservation of property and admiration of nobility and of wealth can be told beautifully and to wide audiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "intelligent design" [...] {{has become}} a {{liability}} for wedge advocates since the ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. Because {{of the success of}} the Discovery Institute's public relations campaign to make [...] "intelligent design" [...] a household phrase, and the ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District that ID is essentially religious in nature more people recognize it as the religious concept of creationism. Having come closest to accomplishing getting ID into public school science classes in Kansas and Ohio where they succeeded in getting the State Board of Education to adopt ID lesson plans, intelligent design proponents advocated [...] "teach the controversy" [...] as a legally defensible alternative to teaching intelligent design. The Kitzmiller ruling also characterized [...] "teaching the controversy" [...] as part of the same religious ploy as presenting intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. This prompted a move to a fallback position, teaching [...] "critical analysis" [...] of evolutionary theory. Teaching [...] "critical analysis" [...] is viewed as a means of teaching all the ID arguments without using that label. It also picks up the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> the [...] "strengths and weaknesses" [...] of evolutionary theory and [...] "arguments against evolution," [...] which they portray as [...] "a theory in crisis." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1998, {{former members}} of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. According to Biafra, the suit {{resulted}} from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, [...] "Holiday in Cambodia", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. The three former members claimed that their motive {{had nothing to do with}} advertising, and that they had filed suit because Biafra had denied them royalties and failed to promote their albums. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for rereleases of their albums or [...] "posthumous" [...] live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> his cashed royalty checks. [...] Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs that Biafra claims he composed himself to the entire band. In May 2000, a jury found Biafra liable for fraud and malice and ordered him to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages, to the band members. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles.|$|E

2500|$|With the Dover ruling {{describing}} [...] "teach the controversy" [...] as [...] "at best disingenuous, and {{at worst}} a canard", intelligent design proponents have moved to a fallback position, emphasizing contrived flaws in evolution and overemphasizing remaining questions in the theory {{what they call the}} Critical Analysis of Evolution. The Critical Analysis of Evolution strategy is viewed by Nick Matzke and other intelligent design critics as a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label. Critical Analysis of Evolution continues the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> the [...] "criticisms" [...] of evolutionary theory and [...] "arguments against evolution," [...] which continues to be portrayed as [...] "a theory in crisis." [...] Early drafts of the critical analysis of evolution lesson plan referred to the lesson as the [...] "great evolution debate"; one of the early drafts of the lesson plan had one section titled [...] "Conducting the Macroevolution Debate". In a subsequent draft, it was changed to [...] "Conducting the Critical Analysis Activity". The wording for the two sections is nearly identical, with just [...] "debate" [...] changed to [...] "critical analysis activity" [...] wherever it appeared, in the manner of how intelligent design proponents simply replaced [...] "creation" [...] with [...] "intelligent design" [...] in Of Pandas and People to repackage a creation science textbook into an intelligent design textbook.|$|E
