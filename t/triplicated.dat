25|$|Michael Balfe's opera Les Quatre fils Aymon {{based on}} The Four Sons of Aymon was given, as I quattro fratelli as {{a benefit for}} the composer, and was a triumph: 'Cruvelli, aided by Gardoni, Pardini, Coletti, and Massol, secured a most {{effective}} and spirited execution for the work.' The Her Majesty's concerts took place, including a notable performance of the trio 'Don't tickle me I pray' with each part <b>triplicated,</b> with sopranos Cruvelli, Sontag and Jenny Duprez, tenors Reeves, Calzolari and Gardoni, bassi Lablache and others. Cruvelli had 'extra' performances of Il barbiere and La Sonnambula (sung during the season by Sontag), and was considered to have been the star of the very illustrious 1851 season at Her Majesty's.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2002, it {{was noted}} that there were {{variants}} or mutations in the anthrax cultures that were grown from powder found in the letters. Scientists at TIGR sequenced the complete genomes from many of these isolates during the period from 2002 to 2004. This sequencing identified three relatively large changes in some of the isolates, each comprising a region of DNA that had been duplicated or <b>triplicated.</b> The size of these regions ranged from 823 bp to 2607 bp, and all occurred near the same genes. Details of these mutations were published in 2011 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These changes became the basis of PCR assays used to test other samples to find any that contained the same mutations. The assays were validated over the many years of the investigation, and the repository of Ames samples was also being built. From roughly 2003 to 2006 the repository and the screening of the 1,070 Ames samples in that repository were completed.|$|E

30|$|The cultivations {{were carried}} out each for three times in <b>triplicates,</b> using two {{cultures}} of the <b>triplicate</b> for whole cell biotransformation assays and the third culture for mechanical cell disruption by sonication and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis {{as well as for}} determination of the cell dry weight. This finally results in <b>triplicates</b> for every cultivation setup.|$|R

25|$|If few {{species were}} known so far, after 1968 {{the number of}} {{described}} species <b>triplicated.</b> All species described during the later years are uncommon and inhabit restricted areas, some are very rare or even supposedly extinct. In 1968 Robert Louis Dressler described Scuticaria salesiana, discovered in Ecuador in an area far apart from the other Scuticaria range. In 1972, Guido Pabst described Scuticaria kautskyi, found in Espírito Santo State,: Scuticaria kautskyi in Bradea 1: pp.169 Boletim do Herbarium Bradeanum. Rio de Janeiro, 1972. in southeast Brazil and, during the following year, published two species at once, S. itirapinensis and S. irwiniana.: Scuticaria irwiniana and Scuticaria itirapinensis in Bradea 1: pp. 336-7 Boletim do Herbarium Bradeanum. Rio de Janeiro, 1973. In 1982, other species was discovered in Espírito Santo, Scuticaria novaesii. The last described species was S. peruviana, found in Peru in 2002, in the same region of S. salesiana, {{to which it is}} related.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Holder {{believes}} that a further 14 cohortes, which are attested under Trajan, immediately before Hadrian's rule, but not during or after it, probably continued in existence, giving a total of 381 units and 225,000 effectives. The discrepancy between the two scholars is due to: (i) Interpretation of units with the same name and number, but attested in different provinces in the same period. Spaul tends {{to take a more}} cautious approach and to assume such are the same unit moving base frequently, while Holder tends to regard them as separate units which acquired the same number due to duplicated (or even <b>triplicated)</b> seriation. (ii) Assumptions about how many cohortes were equitatae. Spaul accepts only those cohortes specifically attested as equitatae i.e., about 40% of recorded units. Holder estimates that at least 70% of cohortes contained cavalry contingents by the early 2nd century ...|$|E

2500|$|From the outset, the D.H.121 {{was planned}} to employ {{avionics}} which were very advanced for the period.

The avionics were also to have <b>triplicated</b> components for reliability and to allow [...] "majority 2:1 voting" [...] for aircraft guidance during automatic approach and landing. The physical dimensions of most avionics of the period required them to be housed in a large compartment beneath the Trident's flightdeck; the compartment's size was among the factors dictating a distinctive nose undercarriage design: offset by [...] to the port side and retracting sideways to stow across the D.H.121's longitudinal axis.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011, started very {{successfully}} {{for both the}} new directive {{as well as for}} the club. A total of twelve new players were incorporated to the first squad, and the youth team got a lot of new players as well as new trainers for each division. The first squad, started the Apertura 2011 with seven victories in a row, and ended the first round of the tournament in the first position. The alternative team, the reserve, also had a good performance in its internal tournament. They are also leading the positions. A very important fact of this new era of the Olimpia, is that number of active fan members of the club was <b>triplicated</b> just in three months, and that they are still increasing because of the team's great performance. But then again, in the second round of the tournament, a dispute emerged among the chairman, the coach and some of the players, as Marcelo Recanate accused them of [...] "not giving all his finest efforts in the field". The rage remained until the final matches, when Nery Pumpido resigned. Mauro Caballero and Virginio Caceres took the lead and managed to obtain the second place in the tournament.|$|E

[...] This loathing of royalty was naturally intensified beyond utterance in Prussia. [...] "On entering the states of Frederick, I felt redoubled and <b>triplicated</b> my hate for that infamous military trade, most infamous and sole base of arbitrary power." [...] He told his minister that he would be presented only in civil dress, because there were uniforms enough at that court, and he declares that on beholding Frederick he felt [...] "no emotion of wonder, or of respect, but rather of indignation and rage....
