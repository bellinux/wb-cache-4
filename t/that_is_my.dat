25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E

[...] He used his power to censor his critics and banish his enemies. He later justified these measures, stating: [...] "When I took over the government I found the government in anarchy, divided into warring factions, reduced to pure chaos, a hell in miniature..." ...|$|E

After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E
500|$|John Kricfalusi, {{the creator}} of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump", {{which was part of}} a cartoon book series {{viewable}} online.

This idea of [...] singing or dancing and being friends, well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> idea." [...] Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump" [...] and that the claim was [...] "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which {{he said he did not}} enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying.
