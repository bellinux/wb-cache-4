50|$|Again, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> got a {{new manager}} for the 1903 season, E. E. Griest. Griest needed help with the team, so he hired Ben Chamberlain to coach the team. After an {{exhibition}} game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> won their {{first game of the}} season, a 38-0 victory over Neil Avenue Athletic Club.

500|$|Even {{though the}} Nesser {{brothers}} [...] "starred on several occasions", the Patricians' defense was more dominant.

5|$|Thunderstorms strike Texas often, {{especially}} {{the eastern and}} northern portions of the state. Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas.

5|$|US-412 was {{extended}} into Oklahoma in 1988 to encourage recreational travel {{and the resulting}} economic benefit to the state. This extension, in which the new designation replaced or overlapped several already existing highways, brought US-412's western terminus to Woodward.

5|$|While Katrina was intensifying {{as a major}} {{hurricane}} on August28, the NHC {{issued a}} tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from the Alabama border to Destin along <b>the</b> <b>panhandle.</b> The warning was later extended to Indian Pass.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> was in 1900; the Columbus Press-Post reported Jack Walsh creating the [...] "Panhandle railroad team" [...] consisting of [...] "big hardy railroad men." [...] No other articles in 1900 were written about <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles.</b> A game {{was scheduled for}} October 19 of next year, however, no source provided an outcome. In 1901, managed by William Butler of the Ohio Medical University, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> played two games against the Columbus Barracks, a team consisting of local soldiers.

50|$|Over a span {{of twenty}} years, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> were {{considered}} <b>the</b> best pro team {{in the city of}} Columbus.

5|$|Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor {{expanded}} Fluor's business {{outside of}} California in the 1930s. It built refineries in Texas, {{as well as}} oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for <b>the</b> <b>Panhandle</b> Eastern Pipeline Company. Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world. In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project. It built {{an expansion of the}} Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas Oil Field and oil prices stabilized. Though the major urban areas continued to grow, the extreme growth patterns {{of the first three}} decades began to slow. As western Texas and <b>the</b> <b>panhandle</b> region began to be more fully explored, the Permian Basin gradually became the top producing area of the state. Though independent oil companies were still {{an important part of the}} industry for some time, the major new strikes were increasingly made by established companies. World War II helped complete the state's transition to an industrialized and urbanized state with oil facilitating the transition.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandle,</b> and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E

After that, the game [...] "proved disastrous", {{according}} to football historian Chris Willis, to <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles.</b> <b>The</b> final score was 43–7. The Panhandles' only score was a receiving touchdown from Homer Ruh. The All-Americans had six rushing touchdowns, four of which came from Smith. The other two came from Anderson and Hughitt. From these six rushing touchdowns, five of the extra points were converted, and the All-Americans' defense got a safety.|$|R
50|$|Nesser {{frequently}} {{engaged in}} kicking contests with the legendary Jim Thorpe; {{he once was}} credited with a 63-yard field goal and his punts were recalled as averaging 70 yards in the air.

He led <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> in scoring during most of his professional seasons.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{indigenous peoples}} traveled through Oklahoma {{as early as}} the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita, Kichai, Teyas, Escanjaques, and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains Villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandle</b> culture people living in panhandle region. Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450.|$|E

With a {{population}} of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also worth noting most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, most helium is {{extracted}} from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and <b>the</b> <b>Panhandle</b> Field in Texas. Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National Helium Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off, {{and is expected}} to be largely depleted by 2021, under the October 2013 Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act (H.R. 527).|$|E

5000|$|Butler left <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> for unknown reasons, and the {{new manager}} for the 1902 season was Harry Greenwood. Greenwood placed {{advertisements}} in every newspaper he could in order to schedule games against local opponents. His ad read [...] "The Panhandle Athletic Club has organized a football team {{and would like to}} play any college, high school or manufacturing team on Saturday or Sunday." [...] As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> scheduled four games in 1902: three against the Columbus Barracks and one against <b>the</b> Dennison <b>Panhandles,</b> and finished with a 0-3-1 record.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Panhandles</b> {{may have}} played {{in the first game}} with two APFA opponents. However, due to not having the games start at a {{standardized}} time, and the failure of the NFL of recording the start times, historians can not determine for sure which two teams played in the first league match-up. What is known for a fact is that the first contests between teams listed as APFA members occurred on October 3, 1920. On that date, <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> were defeated by the Dayton Triangles, 14-0, at Triangle Park, and the Rock Island Independents beat the Muncie Flyers, 45-0, in Rock Island. Frank Bacon of <b>the</b> <b>Panhandles</b> is credited with the first punt return for a touchdown.|$|R
