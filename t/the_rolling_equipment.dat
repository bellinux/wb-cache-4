Purpose of the work: development of an electron-optical control method and algorithms for revaling scale {{on the surface of}} a hot-rolled sheet with the use of transmitters in real-time. The results of the work include the proposal of a method permitting enhancement of the reliability and certainty in revealing scale on the surface of a hot-rolled sheet, the development of an algorithm for detecting scale which forms transmitter output signal correction coefficients, and deriving of a formula of the operators of the transmitter contrast error and prescribed-accuracy correction. The performed investigation served as a basis for determining the illuminator and transmitter angles of inclination with respect to the surface unden control. These angles provide for the maximum contrast of the scale against the background of flawless metal. A device is developed for compensating the dergee of diffusion of the object under check. The scale revealing system is put into practice. A prototype system of control of an evident strip shape has successfully passed approbation.

40|$|Couscous agglomerates {{are made}} from durum wheat {{semolina}} by the succession of 4 unit operations: agglomeration, rolling, cooking and drying. Rolling stage is conducted to give a spherical shape to the agglomerates and to separate them according to size criteria. Continuous rolling drum is used by industry, and {{for some of them}} it is composed of an inclined perforated cylinder rotating about its central axis. <b>The</b> <b>rolling</b> stage is one critical operation during the couscous grain processing, as <b>rolling</b> mainly determines <b>the</b> process yield, by generating significant mass flows of too small and too large agglomerates that could reach more than 60 % of the total mass flow. The objective of the present work is to investigate <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> stage as a unit operation, to determine <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> process efficiency and its contribution on the structuring mechanisms of the couscous agglomerates. We used specific <b>rolling</b> <b>equipment</b> at pilot scale. Two metal grids allow separating the agglomerates in three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates.
