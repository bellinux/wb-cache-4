5|$|Arriving at the capitol, I {{sprang from}} my horse, first unbuckling {{the stars and}} stripes, a large flag I had on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> saddle. With Captain Langdon, chief of artillery, I rushed up to the roof. Together we hoisted the first large flag over Richmond, and on {{the peak of the}} roof drank to its success.|$|E
25|$|Anquetil's {{head was}} a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what {{happened}} when Jacques crossed the line. Close to fainting, he collapsed on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> car. With barely any breath left, exhausted, but 200 per cent lucid, he asked me: 'How much?' I told him 14 seconds. 'That's one more than I need. I've got 13 in hand'.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress, one {{up the back of}} my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

60|$|In {{that happy}} {{frame of mind}} I reached <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dingy abode. Imagine my {{surprise}} on being confronted with two agents of police, each with fixed bayonet, who refused to let me pass.|$|R
5000|$|... "Nature" [...] {{was written}} by 19-year-old Wayne Mason, the {{keyboard}} player of The Fourmyula. Mason describes the song was being written, [...] "in an hour on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> porch <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mum’s house, looking out on a beautiful day with trees and stuff. Bees were buzzing and my heart was fluttering." ...|$|R
500|$|Patton's brigade {{was then}} moved to support U.S. I Corps in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on September 26. He {{personally}} led a troop of tanks through thick fog as they advanced [...] into German lines. Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns {{near the town of}} Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence. Patton {{wrote in a letter to}} his wife: [...] "The bullet went into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> left leg and came out just at the crack of my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum. It was fired at about 50m so made a hole about the size of a [...] dollar where it came out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later {{explained}} [...] "I couldn't even go out <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{house because}} {{there were all these}} girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Monsieur Gerard,' said he, at last, {{tapping his}} {{forefinger}} upon {{one of the}} brandebourgs of gold braid upon <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pelisse, 'I am informed {{that you are a}} very deserving young officer. Your Colonel gives me an excellent account of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{even asked}} to the wedding. I reckon the bride had my {{pedigree}} and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> elevation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> habits all mapped out, {{and she decided}} that Perry would trot better in double harness without any unconverted mustang like Buck Caperton whickering around on the matrimonial range. So it was six months before I saw Perry again.|$|R
60|$|Therefore it was that, {{when we came}} {{each day}} on <b>the</b> green in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> uncle's house to go through such {{manoeuvres}} as our instructor thought necessary, we had in our hands only those harmless wooden guns.|$|R
6000|$|I am feeling wonderfully fit and well. I don't think I ever lectured {{with greater}} spirit. Oh, if I {{could only get}} this shadow off my life, how happy I should be! Young, fairly wealthy, in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> rank <b>of</b> <b>my</b> profession, engaged to a {{beautiful}} and charming girl--have I not every thing which a man could ask for? Only one thing to trouble me, but what a thing it is! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] said 'Manda Grier. [...] "And I didn't {{know who}} you meant this {{afternoon}} when you was standin' watch 't the window, and says you, 'There! there he is!' and I had to run so quick with the dipper of water I had in my hand to water the plants that I poured it all over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, the moss-roses!" [...] Christina murmured, caressingly. [...] "I {{must have}} a quantity--at least a hundred. Nothing but buds, eh? You must sew them {{in a kind of}} immense apron, down <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress. Packed tight together, eh? It will be delightfully barbarous. And then twenty more or so for my hair. They go very well with powder; don't you think so?" [...] And she turned to Rowland. [...] "I am going en Pompadour." ...|$|E
60|$|I hurried {{away to the}} town, and it was {{not long}} before several {{carpenters}} and masons were on the spot. After a thorough examination, they assured Mrs. Carson that there was no danger, that my house would do no farther damage to her premises, but, to make things certain, they would bring some heavy beams and brace <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house against her cellar wall. When that should be done it would be impossible for it to move any farther.|$|E
40|$|It {{started in}} June when I watched my 6 -year-old brother {{fall off the}} branch of the big oak tree in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> our house. <b>The</b> garden hose, tied around his waist for safety, slipped down his bony body and dropped him head-first, 15 feet, into the grass. He died just as the {{ambulance}} arrived, brain separated from spine. My family told me it wasn’t my fault, that I called the ambulance as soon as I could. We hugged each other. We wept. I triple wrapped each <b>of</b> <b>my</b> toes with rubber bands so tight they turned deep blue. I put my socks on. I never untied. My toes fell off and I placed them in a Ziplock bag and labeled it “penance” with a red sharpie. I put the bag in the ice compartment of the fridge-freezer combo I bought with money from my nursing home job.

5000|$|Beck {{discussed}} [...] "No Distraction" [...] with Q saying, [...] "Anybody {{who has a}} {{phone or}} computer lives with the distractions pulling you this way and that. We haven't {{figured out how to}} have access to everybody and everything all the time and how it affects us physically and neurologically. Or at least I haven't.

6000|$|... "Holding <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face, I suppose? Well, it's rather an unusual request and I must {{know a little}} more.

6000|$|I was so fretted by my {{impotence}} {{to leave}} him {{that at the moment}} it did not connect at all with the research of the morning that he was taking out money. I listened sullenly to his talk with Miss Ramell, and saw only, as they say in Wales, with <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, the small flat drawer that had, it seemed, quite a number of sovereigns scattered over its floor. [...] "They're so unreasonable," [...] complained Miss Ramell. Who could be otherwise in a social organization that bordered on insanity? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} of either,' said the lady, in a grave tone, {{calculated}} to restrain the air of gallantry with which I had endeavoured to address her. 'But when you have received my letter you will find good reasons assigned why a written communication will best suit my purpose. I wish you, sir, a good morning.' And she left the apartment, her poor baffled counsel scraping, and bowing, and apologizing for anything {{that might have been}} disagreeable to her, although <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> offence seems to be my having been discovered to be younger than my father.|$|E
60|$|It wasn't so much {{thinking}} {{at the time}} as a sort of photographic thought that came and grew clear. X2 went ripping through the dirty oily water as scissors rip through canvas, and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind was all intent with getting her through under the bridges and in and out among the steam-boats and barges and rowing-boats and piers. I lived with my hands and eyes hard ahead. I thought nothing then of any appearances but obstacles, but for all that {{the back of my mind}} took the photographic memory of it complete and vivid....|$|E

5000|$|... "All of a sudden, {{the window}} blew in.

25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> officers will ride in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat <b>of</b> <b>my</b> limousine with the chauffeur.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are a {{great many}} things you have never heard of, Peter Rabbit," [...] replied Old Mr. Toad drily. [...] "Mine {{is the right way}} to have a tongue. Because it is {{fastened}} way up in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth that way, I can use the whole of it. You see it goes out its full length. Then, when I draw it in with a bug on the end of it, I just turn it over so that the end that was out goes way back in my throat and takes the bug with it to just the right place to swallow." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when one}} of the flowers on my hat leaned over the brim and exuded bloody drops on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat I began to weaken, and to think that if there was nothing better to do I might get under one of the seats; but just then the rain stopped and the sun shone. It was so sudden that it startled me; but not one of those English people {{mentioned}} that the rain had stopped and the sun was shining, and so neither did Jone or I. We was feeling mighty moist and unhappy, but we tried to smile as if we was plants in a greenhouse, accustomed to being watered and feeling all the better for it.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she walked}} away from the wall and I mounted. I moved very slowly onward, and as I turned my head I saw that a row of straggling bushes which grew close to the wall were now between her and me. But I also saw, or thought I saw, between the leaves and boughs, that her face was towards me, and that she was waving her handkerchief. If I had been sure of that, I think I should have jumped over the wall, pushed through the bushes, and should have asked her to give me that handkerchief, that I might fasten it on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cap as, in olden days, a knight going forth to his adventures bound upon his helmet the glove of his lady-love.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{thousand}} thanks,' returned Scioravante; 'I {{shall be}} delighted to marry your daughter, but it is quite unnecessary to send anyone to accompany her.

60|$|She {{took his}} arm, {{and they walked}} on ahead to <b>the</b> {{clearing}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my.</b> cottage, talking earnestly together. I had no clue {{to the meaning of}} those first few sentences which had passed between them. And needless to say, I now lingered far enough behind to be out of earshot. When they reached the turn in the path they halted and waited for me.|$|R
60|$|On {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> green in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> uncle's house, where we three {{had agreed to}} meet, I found that Jacob's outfit was even less than mine. In his grief because of his father's fate, he had thought only of his weapons and ammunition, and by {{the expression on his}} face I knew full well he would use them manfully if we came within striking distance of Lieutenant Wormwood's murderers.|$|R
60|$|There, {{crouched}} up in {{the farthest}} corner, lay the forlorn cause of my terror, {{in the shape of}} a poor little dog--a black and white spaniel. The creature moaned feebly when I looked at it and called to it, but never stirred. I moved away the seat and looked closer. The poor little dog's eyes were glazing fast, and there were spots of blood on its glossy white side. The misery of a weak, helpless, dumb creature is surely one of the saddest of all the mournful sights which this world can show. I lifted the poor dog in my arms as gently as I could, and contrived a sort of make-shift hammock for him to lie in, by gathering up <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress all round him. In this way I took the creature, as painlessly as possible, and as fast as possible, back to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} it meant mischief. Every purple flush of its hideous body told me so. The vague, goggling eyes which were turned always upon me were cold and merciless in their viscid hatred. I dipped the nose of my {{monoplane}} downwards to escape it. As I did so, as quick as a flash there shot out a long tentacle from this mass of floating blubber, and it fell as light and sinuous as a whip-lash across <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> machine. There was a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the hot engine, and it whisked itself into the air again, while the huge flat body drew itself together as if in sudden pain. I dipped to a vol-pique, but again a tentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller as easily {{as it might have}} cut through a smoke wreath. A long, gliding, sticky, serpent-like coil came from behind and caught me round the waist, dragging me out of the fuselage. I tore at it, my fingers sinking into the smooth, glue-like surface, and for an instant I disengaged myself, but only to be caught round the boot by another coil, which gave me a jerk that tilted me almost on to my back.|$|E
6000|$|In {{subordination}} to {{the design}} of this narrative, as defined by its title, the incidents related necessarily group themselves about my own personality as a center; and, as this center, during the few terrible hours of the engagement, maintained a variably constant relation to the open field already mentioned, {{it is important that the}} reader should bear in mind the topographical and tactical features of the local situation. The hither side of the field was occupied by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brigade--a length of two regiments in line, with proper intervals for field batteries. During the entire fight the enemy held the slight wooded acclivity beyond. The debatable ground to the right and left of the open was broken and thickly wooded for miles, in some places quite inaccessible to artillery and at very few points offering opportunities for its successful employment. As a consequence of this the two sides of the field were soon studded thickly with confronting guns, which flamed away at one another with amazing zeal and rather startling effect. Of course, an infantry attack delivered from either side was not to be thought of when the covered flanks offered inducements so unquestionably superior; and I believe the riddled bodies of my poor skirmishers were the only ones left on this [...] "neutral ground" [...] that day. But there was a very pretty line of dead continually growing in our rear, and doubtless the enemy had at his back a similar encouragement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was seated}} in <b>my</b> place <b>of</b> refuge, being as I have told you a man of peace, enjoying the {{consolation}} of religion"--he was very pious in times of trouble.

After that I remember no more." ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said after that. The orders were given, {{there was nothing}} to do but to obey; and the uncrowned King of France was not yet out of danger. Hastings and Tony led two of the horses out of the spinney; at the {{roadside}} they mounted, and then the little lad for whose sake so much heroism, such selfless devotion had been expended, was hoisted up, still half asleep, on <b>the</b> pillion in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Lord Hastings.|$|R
