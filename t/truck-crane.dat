The paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of angular ball bearing deformation at the connecting point of the lower and upper machine assemblies of the <b>truck-crane</b> using the dynamic model with five degrees of free motion. For differential equations derivation Lagrange equations of the second order are applied. Theoretical results obtained are verified by the numerical example for various working operations of the <b>truck-crane...</b>|$|E

This study investigates the use of thermal imaging for monitoring water stress. Experiments were conducted on a wine-grape (Vitis viniferacv. Merlot) vineyard innorthern Israel. Irrigation treatments includedmild,moderate, and severe stress. Thermal and visible (RGB) images of the crop were taken on four days at midday with a FLIR thermal imaging system and a digital camera, respectively, both mounted on a <b>truck-crane</b> 15 m above the canopy. Aluminium crosses were used to match visible and thermal images in post-processing and an artificial wet surface was used to estimate the reference wet temper...|$|E
