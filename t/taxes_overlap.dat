40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-period overlapping-generations model with environmental externalities and uncertain lifetimes, and studies how two sources of population aging, greater longevity {{and a lower}} rate of population growth, affect the politically determined environmental tax {{and the quality of}} the environment. It is shown that greater longevity and a lower rate of population growth have entirely different effects on these factors; greater longevity has no effect on the environmental tax and has a non-positive effect on the environmental quality, whereas a lower rate of population growth has a negative effect on the tax and has a positive effect on the quality. In addition, the political decision-making on the tax leads to an inefficient allocation of capital and environmental quality.

40|$|In a {{group of}} {{countries}} like the European Union all countries seek to achieve their national CO 2 emissions target by a joint emissions trading scheme covering some part of their economies (trading sector) and by a national emissions tax {{in the rest of}} their economies (nontrading sector).

Welfare-maximizing governments determine tax rates and the tradable-permits budget. It is shown that efficiency requires not to levy <b>overlapping</b> emissions <b>taxes</b> and to set the tax rate in the nontrading sector equal to the permit price. In the small-country case emissions control turns out to be efficient if tax rates in the trading sector are flexible. Otherwise it is second-best to violate cost effectiveness and to choose an excessive endowment of tradable permits. If countries are large and optimal tariffs cannot be applied, emissions taxes or subsidies (!) are shown to serve as a perfect surrogate; efficiency cannot be attained unless there is a central authority mandating cost effectiveness and banning <b>overlapping</b> <b>taxes.</b> Fiscal externalities are specified and the countries' welfare in the large and small country case is compared...|$|R

Where these assumptions fail to hold, (1) allowing income averaging between periods may be undesirable, (2) the case for a consumption tax becomes less clearcut, and (3) as revealed by the “new dynamic public finance” literature in economics, there may actually be a strong rationale for taxing saving...|$|R

Twenty-three HTLV- 1 -seronegative controls (SC), 29 asymptomatic HTLV- 1 carriers (AC) and 48 patients with HAM/TSP were enrolled in the study. We evaluated the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with <b>Tax</b> <b>overlapping</b> peptides, the expression of genes related to the CD 8 (+) cytotoxic T-cell response, the frequency of CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+) cells and of dendritic cells, and the HTLV- 1 provirus load (PVL). The frequency of cells producing IFN-gamma in response to Tax 161 - 233, but not to Tax 11 - 19, discriminated patients with HAM/TSP from AC.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} environmental taxation which would control emissions of firms in a model of growth cycles. In the model presented below, the economy may experience two phases of growth and environmental quality: “the no-innovation growth regime” and “the innovation-led growth regime”. Aggregate capital and environmental quality remain constant in the no-innovation growth regime, while they perpetually increase in the innovation-led growth regime. The paper shows that the tax plays a key role in determining whether the economy stably converges to one of the two regimes or fluctuates permanently between them. It also shows that there is a critical level of the tax and that the economy obtains higher growth rates of capital and environmental quality by raising (or reducing) the tax if the initial tax is below (or above) the critical level.

The phosphorylation of two serine residues (S 151 and S 153) at the C terminus is important for the function of HTLV- 2 Rex (Rex- 2). The Rex- 2 phosphomimetic double mutant (S 151 D, S 153 D) is locked in a functionally active conformation. Since rex and <b>tax</b> genes <b>overlap,</b> Rex S 151 D and S 153 D mutants were found to alter the Tax oncoprotein coding sequence and transactivation activities. Therefore, additional Rex- 2 mutants including P 152 D, A 157 D, S 151 Term, and S 158 Term were generated and characterized (“Term” indicates termination codon). All Rex- 2 mutants and wild-type (wt) Rex- 2 localized predominantly to the nucleus/nucleolus, but in contrast to the detection of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of wt Rex- 2 (p 26 and p 24), mutant proteins were detected as a single phosphoprotein species. We found that Rex P 152 D, A 157 D, and S 158 Term mutants are more functionally active than wt Rex- 2 and that the Rex- 2 C terminus and its specific phosphorylation state are required for stability and optimal expression. In the context of the provirus, the more active Rex mutants (A 157 D or S 158 Term) promoted increased viral protein production, increased viral infectious spread, and enhanced HTLV- 2 -mediated cellular proliferation. Moreover, these Rex mutant viruses replicated and persisted in inoculated rabbits despite higher antiviral antibody responses. Thus, we identified in Rex- 2 a novel C-terminal inhibitory domain that regulates functional activity and is positively regulated through phosphorylation.

Studies have indicated that HTLV- 1 has a preferential tropism for CD 4 + T cells in vivo and {{is associated with the}} development of leukemia and neurological disease. Conversely, the in vivo T-cell tropism of HTLV- 2 is less clear, although it appears that CD 8 + T cells preferentially harbor the provirus, with only a few cases of disease association. The difference in T-cell transformation tropism has been confirmed in vitro as shown by the preferential transformation of CD 4 + T cells by HTLV- 1 versus the transformation of CD 8 + T cells by HTLV- 2. Our previous studies showed that <b>Tax</b> and <b>overlapping</b> Rex do not confer the distinct T-cell transformation tropisms between HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2. Therefore, for this study HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 recombinants were generated to assess the contribution of LTR and env sequences in T-cell transformation tropism. Both sets of proviral recombinants expressed p 19 Gag following transfection into cells. Furthermore, recombinant viruses were replication competent and had the capacity to transform T lymphocytes. Our data showed that exchange of the env gene resulted in altered T-cell transformation tropism compared to wild-type virus, while exchange of long terminal repeat sequences had no significant effect.

40|$|In {{the course}} of our study of {{individual}} tax systems, we necessarily touch on all of the above issues. Before doing so, it is worth emphasizing that the personal tax is one of three main broad-based <b>taxes</b> whose bases <b>overlap</b> to a considerable extent, the others being the VAT and payroll taxes. The bases of the latter two taxes are roughly similar in present value terms. They differ {{only to the extent that}} an individual’s net inheritances (the present value of inheritances less bequests) and other net transfers are positive. Both are essentially taxes that distort the labor-leisure choice (including the participation decision), at least to the extent that payroll taxes are not used to finance actuarially fair transfer programs. Thus, if payroll taxes finance the equivalent of fully contributory pension funds, they are unlikely to impose a distortion on the labor-leisure choice. In practice, payroll taxes are usually not earmarked to individual accounts so this is not an issue. Since for most taxpayers the bulk of taxable income consists of labor income, there is considerable overlap among the three bases. The main difference is that individual taxes might include elements of capital income in the base (for which the overlap might be with wealth or property taxes). That being the case, the overall tax rate faced by individuals includes all three tax rates. ...|$|R

Both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells are susceptible to HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 infection in vitro, and HTLV- 1 has a preferential immortalization and transformation tropism of CD 4 + T cells, whereas HTLV- 2 immortalizes and transforms primarily CD 8 + T cells. The molecular mechanism that determines this tropism of HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 has not been determined. HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 carry the tax and rex transregulatory genes in separate but partially overlapping reading frames. Since Tax {{has been shown to be}} critical for cellular transformation in vitro and interacts with numerous cellular processes, we hypothesized that the viral determinant of transformation tropism is encoded by tax. Using molecular clones of HTLV- 1 (Ach) and HTLV- 2 (pH 6 neo), we constructed recombinants in which <b>tax</b> and <b>overlapping</b> rex genes of the two viruses were exchanged. p 19 Gag expression from proviral clones transfected into 293 T cells indicated that both recombinants contained functional Tax and Rex but with significantly altered activity compared to the wild-type clones.

Both recombinants were competent to transform T lymphocytes with an efficiency similar to that of the parental viruses.

40|$|Most {{studies that}} explore deep GHG {{emission}} reduction scenarios assume that climate goals are reached by implementing least-cost emission mitigation options, typically by implementing a global carbon tax. Although such a method provides insight into total mitigation costs, {{it does not}} provide much information about how to achieve a transition towards a low-carbon energy system, which is of critical importance to achieving ambitious climate targets. To enable sensible deep emission reduction strategies, this study analysed the effectiveness of 16 specific mitigation measures on a global level up to 2050, by using an energy-system simulation model called TIMER. The measures range from specific energy efficiency measures, like banning traditional light bulbs and subsidizing electric vehicles, to broader policies like introducing a carbon tax in the electricity sector. All measures combined lead to global CO 2 emission reductions ranging between 39 % and 73 % compared to baseline by 2050, depending on the inclusion of sectoral carbon taxes {{and the availability of}} carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power.
