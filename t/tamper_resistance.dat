2500|$|Security – Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved <b>tamper</b> <b>resistance</b> to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E

30|$|At present, {{dealing with}} the piracy and {{tampering}} of images has become a notable challenge, due {{to the presence of}} smart mobile gadgets. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking algorithm based on non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) for improving the security aspects of such images. Moreover, the fusion of feature searching approach with watermarking methods has gained prominence in the current years. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a technique in computer vision for detecting and illustrating the local features in images. Nevertheless, the SIFT algorithm can extract feature points with high invariance that are resilient to several issues like rotation, compression, and scaling. Furthermore, the extracted feature points are embedded with watermark using the NSCT approach. Subsequently, the tree split, voting, rotation searching, and morphology techniques are employed for improving the robustness against the noise. The proposed watermarking algorithm offers superior capability, better capture quality, and <b>tampering</b> <b>resistance,</b> when compared with existing watermarking approaches.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{and reviews}} {{literature}} regarding {{a range of}} topics important to the research question – the themes apply across all the topics. The topics include label and package warnings, including tamperevident features, to review their effect on the consumer behaviour of changing usage or purchase decisions. This information was then applied to gain insight into anticounterfeit product/package efforts. Based on this research, it appears that there is value for brand marketers to enhance their anticounterfeit efforts and consumer confidence by utilizing warning labels and information labels on their labels or packages. Currently, consumer perception of a domestic counterfeit product threat (promoted as genuine products), even for pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, although increasing has still been very low. Generally, the consumers believe and expect that the product purchased from retailers is safe and genuine. The study reviewed many key warning and label communication areas: consumer behaviour review, technical specifications, anticounterfeit, <b>tamper</b> evidence/tamper <b>resistance,</b> over‐the‐counter drugs, alcohol, cigarette, nutrition food and nutrition supplements. To complete the insight on communicating with the consumer, a review of label legibility was included. Before brand marketers consider adding anticounterfeit warning labels, extensive consumer behaviour research should be conducted {{in areas such as}} fear appeals and involuntary risk outrage...|$|R

30|$|An {{efficient}} fragile image watermarking {{technique for}} pixel level <b>tamper</b> detection and <b>resistance</b> is proposed. It uses five most significant {{bits of the}} pixels to generate watermark bits and embeds them in the three least significant bits. The proposed technique uses a logistic map and takes advantage of its sensitivity property to a small change in the initial condition. At the same time, it incorporates the confusion/diffusion and hashing techniques used in many cryptographic systems to resist tampering at pixel level {{as well as at}} block level. This paper also presents two new approaches called nonaggressive and aggressive tamper detection algorithms. Simulations show that the proposed technique can provide more than 99.39 % tamper detection capability with less than 2.31 % false-positive detection and less than 0.61 % false-negative detection responses.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} 5 MSB: 3 LSB {{technique}} that uses logistic map and confusion/diffusion and hashing cryptographic techniques to improve <b>tamper</b> detection and <b>resistance</b> capabilities. It also uses a key and pseudorandom number generator to select secure pixels for watermark embedding. The confusion process {{is used to}} induce complexity in the relation map between {{the distribution of the}} watermark and the value of the user-defined key. Similarly, the diffusion process is used to dissipate the image property displayed in the 5 MSBs of a pixel over a long-range statistics of the watermark using the logistic-map. The chaotic behavior of the logistic-map is also used as hashing mechanism to generate a set of 3 -bits watermarks. This proposed technique is discussed in Section 2. This paper also proposes new concepts called nonaggressive (NgTDM) and aggressive (AgTDM) scenarios for efficient tamper detection and these scenarios are presented in Section 3 of this paper. Simulation results and findings are presented in Section 4. A conclusion is also presented in Acknowledgement.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} accelerated aging experiments (weathering) conducted on prototype tamper tapes bonded {{to a variety of}} surface materials. The prototype tamper tapes were based on the patented Confirm{reg_sign} tamper-indicating technology developed and produced by 3 M Company. Tamper tapes bonded to surfaces using pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) and four rapid-set adhesives were evaluated. The configurations of the PSA-bonded tamper tapes were 1. 27 -cm-wide Confirm{reg_sign} 1700 windows with vinyl underlay and 2. 54 -cm-wide Confirm{reg_sign} 1700 windows with vinyl and polyester underlays. The configurations of the rapid-set adhesive-bonded tamper tapes were 2. 54 -cm-wide Confirm{reg_sign} (1700, 1500 with and without primer, and 1300) windows with vinyl underlay. Surfaces used for bonding included aluminum, steel, stainless steel, Kevlar{reg_sign}, brass, copper, fiberglass/resin with and without gel coat, polyurethane-painted steel, acrylonitrile:butadiene:styrene plastic, polyester fiberglass board, Lexan polycarbonate, and cedar wood. Weathering conditions included a QUV cabinet (ultraviolet light at 60 {degrees}C, condensing humidity at 40 {degrees}C), a thermal cycling cabinet (- 18 {degrees}C to 46 {degrees}C), a Weather-O-Meter (Xenon lamp), and exposure outdoors in Daytona Beach, Florida. Environmental aging exposures lasted from 7 weeks to 5 months. After exposure, the tamper tapes were visually examined and tested for transfer <b>resistance.</b> <b>Tamper</b> tapes were also exposed to a variety of chemical liquids (including organic solvents, acids, bases, and oxidizing liquids) to determine chemical resistance and to sand to determine abrasion resistance...|$|R

Recent developments in technology of Optical variable devices permit world leaders to create more advanced security elements: Kinegrams™, Exelgrams™, Pixelgrams™, Kineforms™. These products are used for protecting the most confidential documents and bank notes, but now even their security level can not be enough, and besides their automatic identification is vulnerable to factors of instability. We elaborate new visual security devices based on the usage of expensive and advanced technology of Combined optical/digital security devices. The technology unites digital and analog methods of synthesis and recording Visual security devices. The analog methods include technique of optical holography - different combinations of 2 D/ 3 D, 3 D, 2 D/ 3 D + 3 D structures. Basing on them the design with elements of 3 D graphic including security elements and hidden machine-readable images are implemented. The digital methods provide synthesis of Optical Variable Devices including special security elements, computer generated holograms and Kineforms™. Using them we create determined and quasi-random machine-readable images. Recording are carried out using the combined optical and electron-beam submicrometer technology. The results obtained show effectiveness of the combined technology permitting to increase the security level essentially that should increase <b>tamper</b> and counterfeit <b>resistance</b> for many years...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of safeguards strengthening measures approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors (1992 - 1997), international nuclear safeguards inspectors {{have been able to}} utilize environmental sampling (ES) (e. g. deposited particulates, air, water, vegetation, sediments, soil and biota) in their safeguarding approaches at bulk uranium/plutonium handling facilities. Enhancements of environmental sampling techniques used by the IAEA in drawing conclusions concerning the absence of undeclared nuclear materials or activities will soon be {{able to take advantage of}} a recent step change improvement in the gathering and analysis of air samples at these facilities. Location specific air monitoring feasibility tests have been performed with excellent results in determining attribute and isotopic composition of chemical elements present in an actual test-bed sample. Isotopic analysis of collected particles from an Aerosol Contaminant Extractor (ACE) collection, was performed with the standard bulk sampling protocol used throughout the IAEA network of analytical laboratories (NWAL). The results yielded bulk isotopic values expected for the operations. Advanced designs of air monitoring instruments such as the ACE may be used in gas centrifuge enrichment plants (GCEP) to detect the production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) or enrichments not declared by a State. Researchers at Savannah River National Laboratory in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory are developing the next generation of ES equipment for air grab and constant samples that could become an important addition to the international nuclear safeguards inspector's toolkit. Location specific air monitoring to be used to establish a baseline environmental signature of a particular facility employed for comparison of consistencies in declared operations will be described in this paper. Implementation of air monitoring will be contrasted against the use of smear ES when used during unannounced inspections, design information verification, limited frequency unannounced access, and complementary access visits at bulk handling facilities. Analysis of technical features required for <b>tamper</b> indication and <b>resistance</b> will demonstrate the viability of successful application of the system in taking ES within a bulk handling location. Further exploration of putting this technology into practice is planned to include mapping uranium enrichment facilities for the identification of optimal for installation of air monitoring devices...|$|R
