25|$|The IRS publishes {{tax forms}} which <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} {{to choose from}} and use for calculating and reporting their federal tax obligations. The IRS also publishes a number of forms for its own internal operations, such as Forms 3471 and 4228 (which are used during the initial processing of income tax returns).|$|E
50|$|A {{taxpayer}} could {{file the}} return themselves or get an accountant/paid preparer to file it for them.

50|$|<b>Taxpayer</b> {{buildings}} <b>are</b> {{criticized for}} being poorly or cheaply built, but allow a developer {{to stay in business}} while they wait for more favorable conditions. A fire in a <b>taxpayer</b> <b>is</b> a special hazard in firefighting. The poor quality construction often burns readily, and the architecture tends to encourage backdrafts. Many have been renovated several times over and have concealed or undocumented voids. More modern <b>taxpayers</b> <b>were</b> built with fire-resistant materials and are less of a hazard.|$|R
25|$|Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent {{personal}} income tax, {{depending upon the}} amount earned and filing status. <b>Taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (Social Security and Medicare tax).|$|E

This declaration is made on the IRPEF form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the IRPEF tax is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} case, Schulz and his We the People Foundation organization argued unsuccessfully that, {{based on the}} First Amendment {{right of the people}} to petition the government for a redress of grievances, the government should have a duty to respond to a taxpayer's demand for an explanation as to why <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> subject to income tax. On May 8, 2007, the Schulz argument was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in We the People Foundation, Inc. v. United States.|$|E

25|$|Free schools, {{introduced}} by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition following the 2010 general election, are newly established schools in England set up by parents, teachers, charities or businesses, {{where there is a}} perceived local need for more schools. They are funded by <b>taxpayers,</b> <b>are</b> academically non-selective and free to attend, and like Foundation schools and Academies, are not controlled by a local authority. They are ultimately accountable to the Secretary of State for Education. Free schools are an extension of the existing Academy Programme. The first 24 free schools opened in Autumn 2011.|$|E
25|$|Cases are calendared {{for trial}} {{as soon as}} {{practicable}} (on a first in/first out basis) after the case becomes at issue. When a case is calendared, the parties are notified by the Court of the date, time, and place of trial. Trials are conducted before one judge, without a jury, and <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> permitted to represent themselves if they desire. However, the vast majority of cases are settled by mutual agreement without the necessity of a trial. However, if a trial is conducted, in due course a report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth findings of fact and an opinion. The case is then closed in accordance with the judge's opinion by entry of a decision.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his views}} as a {{possible}} candidate during an appearance on On the Record with Greta Van Susteren in March 2009, Gingrich said, [...] "I am very sad {{that a number of}} Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of earmarks. [...] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent {{in a way that is}} absolutely indefensible...

50|$|The <b>taxpayer</b> <b>was</b> a saver who was {{convinced}} {{to buy a}} deferred annuity because the inside buildup on such policies is tax-deferred. However, he wanted to claim a deduction on the money he borrowed {{that he used to}} buy the annuity. The IRS won and the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>was</b> denied the deduction. An understanding of the economics would immediately reveal that the only reason the transaction had any chance of making sense for the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>was</b> the asymmetric way the-then current tax code allowed a current deduction on the loan liability at the same time allowed tax deferral on the purchased asset. Success would have legitimated tax arbitrage.|$|R

2500|$|Tax payment: Taxpayers {{must pay}} income tax due {{without waiting for}} an assessment. [...] Many <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> subject to {{withholding}} taxes when they receive income.

2500|$|Personal {{deduction}}s: Individuals {{are allowed}} several nonbusiness deductions. [...] A flat amount per person is allowed as a deduction for personal exemptions.

2500|$|Tax credits: All <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{allowed a}} credit for foreign taxes {{and for a}} {{percentage}} of certain types of business expenses.

2500|$|Financial {{arrangements}} are also circular. According to the RCID Finance Department, Walt Disney Co. is RCID's largest taxpayer, paying about 86% of the district's taxes in 2004. The remaining <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{board members and}} lessees of property owned by Disney affiliates (e.g., House of Blues, Travelodge, and Hilton) paying ad valorem taxes. An American Prospect article notes, [...] "Disney pays taxes to Reedy Creek, which gives the money straight back to Disney, and the circle is closed".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} to pay all taxes owed based on the self-assessed tax returns, as adjusted. [...] The IRS [...] allows taxpayers to in certain circumstances, and provides time payment plans that include interest and a [...] "penalty" [...] that is merely added interest. [...] Where taxpayers do not pay tax owed, the IRS has strong means to enforce collection. [...] These include the ability to levy bank accounts and seize property. [...] Generally, significant advance notice is given before levy or seizure. [...] However, in certain rarely used [...] the IRS may immediately seize money and property. [...] The IRS [...] are responsible for most collection activities.|$|E

He did not vote on the automobile industry bailout, though {{he said he would}} have voted for cloture if he had been present. Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> protected if this loan is to occur, I believe that if the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we certainly have a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E

2500|$|Credit/default: Default risk is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. [...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning that <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{on the hook for}} any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the liabilities to taxpayers.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{voters and}} <b>taxpayers</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{not aware that}} the actions of their local governments in Proposition 218 matters are usually not in their best interests. [...] This results from the fact that, with respect to Proposition 218 matters, actions {{in the best interests}} of local governments are usually not aligned with the best interests of constituents served by those local governments. [...] This often results in political friction and hostility between voters and their elected representatives in some local governments. [...] It also places a greater emphasis on voters raising Proposition 218 compliance and support issues in local governing body election campaigns so as to increase the likelihood of electing candidates who will take actions in Proposition 218 matters that will be more aligned with the best interests of voters and taxpayers.|$|E
