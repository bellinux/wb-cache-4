40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a novel {{adaptive}} observer-based technique for estimating the amplitude, frequency and phase of a single sinusoidal signal from a measurement affected by structured and unstructured disturbances. The structured disturbances are modelled as a time-polynomial so as to represent bias and drift phenomena typically present in applications, whereas the unstructured disturbances are modelled as bounded noise signals. The proposed estimation technique exploits a specific adaptive observer scheme equipped with a switching criterion allowing to properly address in a stable way poor excitation scenarios. The estimator's stability properties are analyzed by Input-to-State Stability arguments. The practical characteristics of the proposed estimation approach are evaluated and compared with other existing tools by extensive simulation <b>trials.</b> <b>Real</b> experimental results are provided as well...|$|R

The nonlinear nature of vehicle dynamics makes it a challenging problem in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field, {{as long as a}} stable, accurate controller is compulsorily needed in order to ensure safety during navigation. The problem has been tackled under two different approaches. The first one is based on chained systems theory, while the second controller relies on fuzzy logic. A comparative analysis has been carried out based on the results achieved in practical <b>trials.</b> <b>Real</b> tests were conducted using a DGPS-driven electric Citroen Berlingo in a private test circuit located at the Industrial Automation Institute of the CSIC (Arganda del Rey, Madrid).
