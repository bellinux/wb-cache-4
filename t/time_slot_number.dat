For case (2), a receiver node {{is only in the}} S 2 state during the time required for receiving the data message; while a sender node remains in the state S 3 for delivering one message to the network. Both, receiver and sender nodes occupy a unique slot within the inactive period with these power states, but using a different reserved slot. The sender always reserves the same <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> (<b>number</b> 0). However, the time slot used by the receiver depends on the hop distance of the current sender [e.g., if the reservation request message has been forwarded over two nodes (two-hops) before reaching the receiver, it will use the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>number</b> 2]. Finally, for case (3), each intermediate node needs two slots per data message within the inactive period, one for listening to the physical medium and receiving the message under consideration, and another slot for retransmitting it to the next intermediate node along the communications path. This way, the amount of energy consumed is greater than the one corresponding to case (2), where a single slot is used for transmitting (sender) or receiving (receiver).|$|E

30|$|A way of {{exploiting}} the overhearing capabilities of transmitting nodes using PNC principles is through space-time network coding (STNC) [22].

A step to increase the diversity of the previous system is taken in [23] and in [24], where the authors propose that each relay decodes the signal not only from the transmitting nodes but also from the previously transmitting relays.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{technological}} advances have motivated largescale deployment of RFID systems. RFID readers are often static and carefully deployed in a planned manner. However, {{the distribution and}} movements of tags are often dynamically changed and unpredictable. We study a challenging problem of scheduling the activation of the readers without collision such that the system can work in a stable way in the long term. Here a schedule is stable if at any <b>time</b> <b>slot,</b> the <b>number</b> of total unread tags is bounded from above with high probability under this scheduling. In this paper, we propose a stable reader activation scheduling protocol, RASPberry, in multi-reader RFID systems. We analytically prove that our scheduling protocol, RASPberry, is stable if the arrival rate of tags {{is less than the}} processing rate of all readers. In RASPberry, at any <b>time</b> <b>slot,</b> a reader can determine its status using only information of readers within a local neighborhood.

30|$|In both designs, a {{distinction}} {{needs to be}} made between two sets of factors: general factors which affect an instance’s structure (geographical spread of the customers), and factors which only affect time window characteristics (time window width, percentage of customers selecting a preferred <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> and <b>number</b> of orders). For each factor level of the general factor, 30 instances are generated. The generation of these instances is further explained in section 4.2. All these instances are then solved using the integrated algorithm for different levels of the second type of factors which only affect time window characteristics. This creates dependent observations (“repeated measures”), which results in greater statistical power. However, as observations for some of the factors are no longer independent, a mixed-model ANOVA is required to analyse the main and interaction effects of the factors (with time window width, percentage of customers selecting a time window and number of orders being examples of within-subjects factors and geographical spread of customers as between-subjects factor).|$|R

We {{present a}} model of the LMAC {{protocol}} for wireless sen-sor networks in order to analyse collision probabilities for nodes selecting a <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> We consider fully connected topologies consisting of 3 and 4 nodes, and use probabilistic Uppaal (Uppaal PRO 0. 2) for modelling and analysis.

However, the results, which are exact due to the model checking technique, indicates that there is only a small loss by using optimistic wait times. This confirms the previously known results which have been reached through simulations. Based on our analysis re-sults, we propose an optimistic choice of a network set-up depending on the probability of waiting times. Besides this, based on the probability of collisions we compare the results of the number of nodes to the <b>number</b> of <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> and suggest a network model for better performance and reduced cost. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} channel access control scheme fit to dense {{acoustic}} sensor nodes in a sensor network. In the considered scenario, multiple acoustic sensor nodes within communication {{range of a}} cluster head are grouped into clusters. Acoustic sensor nodes in a cluster detect acoustic signals and convert them into electric signals (packets). Detection by acoustic sensors can be executed periodically or randomly and random detection by acoustic sensors is event driven. As a result, each acoustic sensor generates their packets (50 bytes each) periodically or randomly over short time intervals (400 ms~ 4 seconds) and transmits directly to a cluster head (coordinator node). Our approach proposes to use a slotted carrier sense multiple access. All acoustic sensor nodes in a cluster are allocated to <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> and the <b>number</b> of allocated sensor nodes to each <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> is uniform. All sensor nodes allocated to a <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> listen for packet transmission {{from the beginning of}} the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> for a duration proportional to their priority.

The order of packet transmissions with the acoustic sensor nodes in the <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> is autonomously adjusted according to the history of packet transmissions in the <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> In simulations, performances of the proposed scheme are demonstrated by the comparisons with other low rate wireless channel access schemes.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the probability distributionP, in uniform distribution, as shown in Figure 2, all the contending nodes have the same probability of transmitting in a randomly chosen <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> From Figure 2, in the probability distributionP, we can depict that when the population of competing nodes (n) is large, most of the nodes will choose medium to higher <b>slot</b> <b>numbers</b> of CW before accessing the channel and a very few nodes will choose low <b>slot</b> <b>numbers,</b> hence, a collision-free transmission {{will take place in}} lower <b>slot</b> <b>numbers.</b> When n is medium, most nodes will choose higher <b>slot</b> <b>numbers</b> and a collision-free transmission will take place in medium <b>slot</b> <b>numbers.</b> Similarly, when n is small, a collision-free transmission will take place in higher <b>slot</b> <b>numbers.</b> Thus for any value of n, and for any fast change in n, a collision free transmission can take place. These special characteristics of IB give the advantage over the BEB in terms of different performance metrics. If only one node gets the chance to select the contention slot within the fixed CW, it will transmit in that slot. While other nodes will select new random contention slots for next contention process, to win channel medium, regardless of success or failure of transmission of winner node.|$|R
