5000|$|At Henley Royal Regatta, held on {{the same}} water as Henley Women's but 2112m (officially 1 mile, 550 yards) long, and raced over 5 days, Leeds had two crews entered. Kristine Johnson {{returned}} to Henley to race {{against some of the}} top single scullers from around the world, producing a magnificent performance to achieve one of only two qualifying spots in the qualification time-trials. Johnson was drawn against US national rower Gevvie Stone of Cambridge (USA) Boat Club, 2010 runner-up in this event and one of the top scullers from the USA. Johnson raced well but her opponent proved too strong, winning by four lengths. Stone again went on to make the final of the event. In the Wyfold Challenge Cup for coxless fours, Leeds RC's first men's crew was entered. No crews were required to qualify for this event, and Leeds were drawn against their local counterparts from Bradford ARC in the first round. The first of five rounds in the event took place on Wednesday 29 June. Despite a poor start, where Leeds lost three-quarters of a length very quickly, and trailing at the first <b>timing</b> <b>marker,</b> Leeds picked it up and rowed through Bradford, winning by a relatively comfortable two-and-a-quarter lengths. In the second round the next day, Leeds raced Henley RC's [...] "B" [...] crew, who had beaten a crew from Thames RC in round 1. After a close start with the crews neck-and-neck at the end of Temple Island, the crew from Henley, racing on home water, started to pull away. With significant support for Leeds on the bank, the race remained close but Henley produced a more solid race to win by two lengths in a time of 7:21.|$|E
40|$|The {{main idea}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to propose and justify a general framework {{for the development of}} safety-related systems based on a selection of criticality and the required level of integrity. We show that formal methods can be practically and consistently introduced into the system design lifecycle without incurring excessive development cost. An insight into the process of generating and validating a formal specification from an engineering point of view is illustrated, in conjunction with formal definitions of specification models, safety criteria and risk assessments. Engineering specifications are classified into two main classes of systems, memoryless and memory bearing systems. Heuristic approaches for specification generation and validation of these systems are presented and discussed with a brief summary of currently available formal systems and their supporting tools. It is further shown that to efficiently address different aspects of real-world problems, the concept of embedding one logic within another mechanised logic, in order to provide mechanical support for proofs and reasoning, is practical. A temporal logic framework, which is embedded in Higher Order Logic, is used to verify and validate the design of a real-time system. Formal definitions and properties of temporal operators are defined in HOL and real-time concepts such as <b>timing</b> <b>marker,</b> interrupt and timeout are presented. A second major case study is presented on the specification a solid model for mechanical parts. This work discusses the modelling theory with set theoretic topology and Boolean operations. The theory is used to specify the mechanical properties of large distribution transformers. Associated mechanical properties such as volumetric operations are also discussed...|$|E

It was localized to a small area in the second right intercostal space, and disap-peared entirely when firm pressure with the stethoscope bell was applied over the site of maximum intensity. He believed the murmur was extracardiae, and owed its origin to en-larged tortuous branches of the internal mam-mary artery. In an extensive study of women during pregnancy and the puerperium he found 13 instances of such a murmur. Fresh interest in the origin and mechanism of this extracardiac murmur has recently developed. 2 - 9 Scott and Murphy 7 introduced the term mammary souffle to describe the mur-mur, since they considered the mechanism {{similar to that of}} the uterine souffle. We have recently encountered several ex-amples of a mammary souffle in patients re-ferred with such diagnoses as patent ductus arteriosus, aortic stenosis with regurgitation, and ventricular septal defect. The diagnostic difficulties created by these cases stimulated the following investigation into the incidence and clinical features of the mammary souffle.

5000|$|AES53 is a {{standard}} first published in October 2006 by the Audio Engineering Society [...] that specifies how the <b>timing</b> <b>markers</b> specified in AES47 {{may be used to}} associate an absolute time-stamp with individual audio samples. AES47 specifies a format for the transmission of digital audio over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. A recommendation is made to refer these timestamps to the SMPTE epoch which in turn provides a reference to UTC and GPS time. It thus provides a way of aligning streams from disparate sources, including synchronizing audio to video, and also allows the total delay across a network to be controlled when the transit time of individual cells is unknown. This is most effective in systems where the audio is aligned with an absolute time reference such as GPS, but can also be used with a local reference.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a two-section electronic device for better recording of rapid bioelectric phenomena on the cathode-ray oscillograph screen. In section A (fig. 2), proportional brightening of the trace during transient phenomena {{is achieved by}} application of a suitable positive voltage to the cathode-ray tube grid (Z input). This voltage, proportional {{to the increase in}} writing-speed of the spot, is obtained by differentiation of the input signal. In section B (fig. 3), intensity modulation is produced by a positive square voltage applied to the grid. The square pulse is delivered by a one-shot multivibrator, triggered by the phenomenon under observation. This same device, used as a negative pulse-generator driven by an external oscillator, may produce intensity-modulated <b>timing</b> <b>markers</b> which blank the trace at known intervals.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{our studies}} of temporal variations of cosmic rays beyond the heliospheric termination shock (HTS) using Voyager 1 (V 1) data when V 1 was beyond 94 AU. This new study utilizes cosmic ray protons and electrons of several energies. Notable transient decreases of 5 â 50 % are observed in galactic cosmic ray nuclei and electrons at V 1 shortly after similar decreases are observed at Voyager 2 (V 2) still inside the HTS. These decreases at V 1 {{appear to be}} related to the large solar events in September 2005 and December 2006 and the resulting outward moving interplanetary shock. These two large interplanetary shocks were the largest observed at V 2 after V 1 crossed the HTS at the end of 2004.

From the timing of the decreases observed when the shock first reaches the HTS and then several months later encounters the heliopause, we can estimate the heliosheath thickness to be 31 Â± 4 and 37 Â± 6 AU, respectively, for the two sequences of three decreases seen at V 1. These values, along with the distances to the HTS that are determined, give distances from the Sun to the heliopause of 121 Â± 4 and 124 Â± 6 AU, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Establishing how {{mammalian}} {{chromosome replication}} is regulated and how groups of replication origins are organized into replication bands will significantly increase {{our understanding of}} chromosome organization. Replication time bands in mammalian chromosomes show overall congruency with structural R- and G-banding patterns as revealed by different chromosome banding techniques. Thus, chromosome bands reflect variations in the longitudinal structure and function of the chromosome, but {{little is known about}} the structural basis of the metaphase chromosome banding pattern. At the microscopic level, both structural R and G bands and replication bands occupy discrete domains along chromosomes, suggesting separation by distinct boundaries. The purpose of this study was to determine replication timing differences encompassing a boundary between differentially replicating chromosomal bands. Using competitive PCR on replicated DNA from flow-sorted cell cycle fractions, we have analyzed the replication <b>timing</b> of <b>markers</b> spanning roughly 5 Mb of human chromosome 13 q 14. 3 /q 21. 1. This is only the second report of high-resolution analysis of replication timing differences across an R/G-band boundary.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Menarche is a {{milestone}} of reproductive development, and its timing may be differentially {{influenced by the}} growth conditions before birth and those between birth and puberty. The present study explored the relationships among menarcheal <b>timing</b> and <b>markers</b> of prenatal and midchildhood growth in healthy Australian girls. SETTING, DESIGN, AND PATIENTS: A total of 156 girls aged 8 yr from a birth cohort of full-term babies had height, weight, and waist circumference measured. One hundred three girls had dual x-ray absorptiometry performed and blood analyzed for insulin, leptin, IGF-I, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. Girls were followed up at age 15 yr and their age of menarche was recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included age of menarche; birth weight and birth length; height, weight, waist circumference, and body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry; and plasma insulin, leptin, IGF-I, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate at age 8 yr. RESULTS: Girls with earlier menarche were light and long at birth and had higher total and central adiposity and IGF-I and estradiol levels in midchildhood, compared with those with later menarche. Age of menarche was best predicted by combining size at birth and body mass index z score at age 8 yr (r 2 = 0. 12; P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The timing of menarche appears to be influenced in opposing directions by pre- and postnatal growth. Menarche was found to occur earlier in girls who were long and light at birth and who had a higher fat mass and circulating IGF-I in childhood.

5000|$|Tracing back minute {{differences}} in the genomes of modern humans by methods of genetic genealogy, can and {{have been used to}} produce models of historical migration. Though these give indications of the routes taken by ancestral humans, the dating of the various genetic markers is improving. The earliest migrations (dated c. 75.000 BP) from the Red Sea shores have been most likely along southern coast of Asia. After this, tracking and <b>timing</b> genetical <b>markers</b> gets increasingly difficult. What is known, is that on areas, of what is now Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, genetic markers diversify (from about 60000 BCE), and subsequent migrations emerge to all directions (even back to the Levant) and North Africs. From the foothills of the Zagros, big game hunting cultures developed which spread across the Eurasian steppe. Crossing the Caucasus and the Ural Mountains were the ancestors of Samoyeds and the ancestors of Uralic peoples, developing sleds, skis and canoes. Through Khazakhstan moved the ancestors of the Indigenous Americans (dated 50000 - 40000 BCE). Eastbound (maybe through Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin went the ancestors of the northern Chinese and Koreans. It is possible that the routes taken by the Indo-European ancestors travelled across the Bosphorus. Genetic evidence suggests a number of separate migrations (1.Anatoleans 2.Tocharians, 3 Celto-Illyrians, 4.Germanic and Slav, - possibly in this order). Archaeological evidence has not been identified for a number of different groups. On historical linguistic evidence, see f.e. classification of Thracian. The traditional view of associating early Celts with the Hallstatt culture, and the Nordic Bronze Age with Germanic peoples. The Roman Empire spread after the first widespread use of iron outside Central Europe from the Villanovan culture area.

40|$|Purpose: Earlier pubertal {{maturation}} {{in women}} {{may be associated with}} better cognition. It is unclear whether or not this also occurs in men. We tested the hypothesis that earlier pubertal development in men was associated with better cognition in later adulthood in a developing Chinese population. Methods: Multivariable linear regression was used in cross-sectional study of 2463 older, Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Mean pubertal age was calculated as the mean of recalled ages of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking and pubarche. We assessed the association of mean pubertal age with delayed 10 -word recall and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Results: Adjusted for age and education, 1 year earlier mean pubertal age was associated with higher delayed 10 -word recall (0. 06 [95 % confidence interval = 0. 02 - 0. 10]) and higher MMSE (0. 08 [0. 03 - 0. 13]) scores. Additional adjustment for childhood and adulthood socio-economic position, sitting height, and leg length did not change the results. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest earlier maturation in men is associated with better cognitive function in later adulthood.

40|$|The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) {{represents}} one of the earth's most significant physical features and there is increasing interest in the historical generation of biodiversity within this region. We hypothesized that there should be clear geographically coherent genetic structuring within one of the world's highest altitude lizards, Phrynocephalus theobaldi, due to considerable historical population fragmentation in this environment. This was tested using a major mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) survey and sequencing of two nuclear markers (AME and RAG- 1) from P. theobaldi, from across the southern QTP.

It represents {{the most frequent}} malignant soft tissue sarcoma affecting the pediatric population and is often treated very aggressively. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma constitute the two major subtypes and exhibit different molecular features.

Contrary to our expectations, the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway was down-regulated in ERMS cells compared with normal myoblasts, and activating this pathway promoted myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the identification of both survivin and sfrp 2 through promoter and expression analyses suggested that increased resistance to apoptosis {{was associated with the}} inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway.

40|$|One {{approach}} to evaluating {{the strength of}} association between a longitudinal marker process and a key clinical event time is through predictive regression methods such as a time-dependent covariate hazard model. For example, a Cox model with time-varying covariates specifies the instantaneous risk of the event {{as a function of}} the time-varying marker and additional covariates. In this manuscript we explore a second complementary approach which characterizes the distribution of the marker as a function of both the measurement time and the ultimate event time. Our goal is to extend the standard diagnostic accuracy concepts of sensitivity and specificity so as to recognize explicitly both the <b>timing</b> of the <b>marker</b> measurement and the timing of disease. The accuracy of a longitudinal marker can be fully characterized using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We detail a semiparametric estimation method for time-dependent ROC curves that adopts a regression quantile approach for longitudinal data introduced by Heagerty and Pepe (1999). We extend the work of Heagerty and Pepe (1999) by developing asymptotic distribution theory for the ROC estimators where the distributional shape for the marker is allowed to depend on covariates. To illustrate our method, we analyze pulmonary function measurements among cystic fibrosis subjects and estimate ROC curves that assess how well the pulmonary function measurement can distinguish subjects that progress to death from subjects that remain alive. Comparing the results from our semiparametric analysis to a fully parametric method discussed by Etzioni et al.

40|$|The rigid {{crustacean}} exoskeleton, the cuticle, {{is composed}} of the polysaccharide chitin, structural proteins and mineral deposits. It is periodically replaced to enable growth and its construction is an energy-demanding process. Ecdysis, the shedding event of the old cuticle, is preceded by a preparatory phase, termed premolt, in which the present cuticle is partially degraded and a new one is formed underneath it. Procambarus clarkii (Girard 1852), an astacid crustacean, was used here to comprehensively examine the changing patterns of gene expression in the hypodermis underlying the cuticle of the carapace at seven time points along ~ 14 premolt days. Next generation sequencing was used to construct a multitissue P. clarkii transcript sequence assembly for general use {{in a variety of}} transcriptomic studies. A reference transcriptome was created here in order to perform digital transcript expression analysis, determining the gene expression profiles in each of the examined premolt stages. The analysis revealed a cascade of sequential expression events of molt-related genes involved in chitin degradation, synthesis and modification, as well as synthesis of collagen and four groups of cuticular structural genes. The new description of major transcriptional events during premolt and the determination of their <b>timing</b> provide temporal <b>markers</b> for future studies of molt progress and regulation. The peaks of the expression of the molt-related genes were preceded by expression peaks of cytoskeletal genes that are hypothesized to be essential for premolt progress through regulating protein synthesis and/or transport, probably by remodeling the cytoskeletal structure.

40|$|The role of fecal {{lactoferrin}} and calprotectin {{has been}} extensively studied {{in many areas of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients' management. The post-operative setting in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients has been less investigated although few promising results come from small, cross-sectional studies. Therefore, the current post-operative management still requires endoscopy 6 - 12 mo after intestinal resection for CD in order to exclude endoscopic recurrence and plan the therapeutic strategy. In patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy, endoscopy is required whenever symptoms includes the possibility of pouchitis. There is emerging evidence that fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are useful surrogate markers of inflammation in the post-operative setting, they correlate with the presence and severity of endoscopic recurrence according to Rutgeerts' score and possibly predict the subsequent clinical recurrence and response to therapy in CD patients. Similarly, fecal markers show a good correlation with the presence of pouchitis, as confirmed by endoscopy in operated UC patients. Fecal calprotectin seems to be able to predict the short-term development of pouchitis in asymptomatic patients and to vary according to response to medical treatment. The possibility of both fecal markers to used in the routine clinical practice for monitoring IBD patients in the post-operative setting should be confirmed in multicentric clinical trial with large sample set.

The study population for the current study consisted of 799 adolescents of whom data were available for at least 1 of the exposure variables (pubertal timing and/or age at menarche) and any of the cardiometabolic markers (waist circumference, cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], glycated hemoglobin) measured at age 16 years. Adolescents self-reported pubertal development at ages 11, 14, and 16 years. We categorized participants with early (84 girls, 88 boys), intermediate (240 girls, 211 boys), or late pubertal timing (89 girls, 85 boys). We estimated differences in cardiometabolic markers using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Girls with early pubertal timing had 1. 54 [*]cm larger waist circumference (95 % CI. 05; 3. 03) and 3. 98 [*]mm Hg higher systolic BP (95 % CI 1. 69; 6. 27) at age 16 years than girls with intermediate pubertal timing. The association with systolic BP remained after adjusting for childhood body mass index (BMI) (age 8 years) but attenuated after adjusting for BMI in adolescence (age 16 years). Boys with early pubertal timing had 0. 79 [*]mmol/mol lower glycated hemoglobin (95 %CI - 1. 38; - 0. 20) than boys with intermediate pubertal timing. CONCLUSIONS: Girls with early pubertal timing had unfavorable BP levels at age 16 years, independent of BMI in childhood. Girls and boys with late pubertal timing had a tendency for lower waist circumference, but no differences in other cardiometabolic <b>markers.</b> Late pubertal <b>timing</b> {{does not appear to}} be a risk factor for unfavorable cardiometabolic markers in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{markers of}} {{intermediate}} health outcomes sometimes provide a superior alternative to traditional measures of pollutant-related disease. Some opportunities and methodologic {{issues associated with}} using markers {{are discussed in the}} context of exposures to four complex mixtures: environmental tobacco smoke and nitrogen dioxide, acid aerosols and oxidant outdoor pollution, environmental tobacco smoke and radon, and volatile organic compounds. For markers of intermediate health outcomes, the most important property is the positive predictive value for clinical outcomes of interest. Unless the marker has a known relationship with disease, a marker response conveys no information about disease risk. Most markers are nonspecific in that various exposures cause the same marker response. Although nonspecificity can be an asset in studies of complex mixtures, it leads to problems with confounding and dilution of exposure-response associations in the presence of other exposures. The <b>timing</b> of a <b>marker's</b> measurement in relation to the occurrence of exposure influences the ability to detect a response; measurements made too early or too late may underestimate the response's magnitude. Noninvasive markers, such as those measured in urine, blood, or nasal lavage fluid, are generally more useful for field studies than are invasive markers. However, invasive markers, such as those measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung specimens from autopsies, provide the most direct evidence of pulmonary damage from exposure to air pollutants. Unfortunately, the lack of basic information about marker properties (e. g., sensitivity, variability, statistical link with disease) currently precludes the effective use of most markers in studies of complex mixtures. - Environ Health Perspect 101 (Suppl 4) : 193 - 197 (1993) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of patients seeking medical treatment for snakebites do not suffer from severe envenomation. However, no guidelines exist for ordering coagulation markers in patients with minimal or moderate envenomation, nor in {{those who do not}} receive antivenom. In this study, we sought to determine whether it was possible to limit the practice of ordering coagulation studies to those patients suffering severe envenomation, rattlesnake envenomation, or both. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all cases of crotalid snakebite presenting to an adult emergency department (ED) from April 1998 to June 2006. Each chart was abstracted for patientâs age, gender, type of snake (if known), severity of envenomation at initial presentation, coagulation test results, whether antivenom was administered, and whether the patient was admitted. Results: Over an approximately 8 -year period, 131 snakebite cases presented that met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 (26. 7 %) had some type of coagulation marker abnormality. Limiting coagulation testing to patients suffering severe envenomation or rattlesnake envenomation would have resulted in failure to identify 89 % or 77 %, respectively, of the 35 patients who were found to have at least 1 abnormal coagulation marker. Conclusion: Our study failed to identify a subset of patients that could be defined as low risk or for whom coagulation marker testing could be foregone. This study suggests that coagulation tests should be routinely performed on all patients presenting to the ED with complaints of envenomation by copperheads, moccasins, or rattlesnakes. Further clarification of when coagulation markers are indicated may require a prospective study that standardizes snake identification and the <b>timing</b> of coagulation <b>marker</b> testing.

40|$|Brain {{activity}} {{related to}} time estimation processes in humans was analyzed using a perceptual phenomenon called auditory temporal assimilation. In a typical stimulus condition, two neighboring time intervals (T 1 and T 2 in this order) {{are perceived as}} equal even when the physical lengths of these time intervals are considerably different. Our previous event-related potential (ERP) study demonstrated that a slow negative component (SNCt) appears in the right-frontal brain area (around the F 8 electrode) after T 2, which is associated with judgment of the equality/inequality of T 1 and T 2. In the present study, we conducted two ERP experiments to further confirm the robustness of the SNCt. The stimulus patterns consisted of two neighboring time intervals marked by three successive tone bursts. Thirteen participants only listened to the patterns in the first session, and judged the equality/inequality of T 1 and T 2 in the next session. Behavioral data showed typical temporal assimilation. The ERP data revealed that three components (N 1; contingent negative variation, CNV; and SNCt) emerged related to the temporal judgment. The N 1 appeared in the central area, and its peak latencies corresponded to the physical <b>timing</b> of each <b>marker</b> onset. The CNV component appeared in the frontal area during T 2 presentation, and its amplitude increased {{as a function of}} T 1. The SNCt appeared in the right-frontal area after the presentation of T 1 and T 2, and its magnitude was larger for the temporal patterns causing perceptual inequality. The SNCt was also correlated with the perceptual equality/inequality of the same stimulus pattern, and continued up to about 400 ms after the end of T 2. These results suggest that the SNCt can be a signature of equality/inequality judgment, which derives from the comparison of the two neighboring time intervals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Aberrations of allelic {{replication}} <b>timing</b> are epigenetic <b>markers</b> {{observed in}} peripheral blood cells of cancer patients. The aberrant markers are non-cancer-type-specific and {{are accompanied by}} increased levels of sporadic aneuploidy. The study aimed at following the epigenetic markers and aneuploidy levels in cells of patients with haematological malignancies from diagnosis to full remission, as achieved by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Methods TP 53 (a tumor suppressor gene assigned to chromosome 17), AML 1 (a gene assigned to chromosome 21 and involved in the leukaemia-abundant 8; 21 translocation) and the pericentomeric satellite sequence of chromosome 17 (CEN 17) were used for replication timing assessments. Aneuploidy was monitored by enumerating the copy numbers of chromosomes 17 and 21. Replication timing and aneuploidy were detected cytogenetically using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) technology applied to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated lymphocytes. Results We show that aberrant epigenetic markers are detected in patients with hematological malignancies from the time of diagnosis through to when they are scheduled to undergo alloSCT. These aberrations are unaffected by the clinical status of the disease and are displayed both during accelerated stages as well as in remission. Yet, these markers are eradicated completely following stem cell transplantation. In contrast, the increased levels of aneuploidy (irreversible genetic alterations) displayed in blood lymphocytes at various stages of disease are not eliminated following transplantation. However, they do not elevate and remain unchanged (stable state). A demethylating anti-cancer drug, 5 -azacytidine, applied in vitro to lymphocytes of patients prior to transplantation mimics the effect of transplantation: the epigenetic aberrations disappear while aneuploidy stays unchanged. Conclusions The reversible nature of the replication aberrations may serve as potential epigenetic blood markers for evaluating the success of transplant or other treatments and for long-term follow up of the patients who have overcome a hematological malignancy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Exon Skipping {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be a successful}} strategy for the gene therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) : the rational is to convert severe Duchenne forms into milder Becker ones. Here we show the selection of U 1 snRNA-antisense constructs able to confer effective rescue of dystrophin synthesis in a Î 44 Duchenne genetic background, through skipping of exon 45; moreover, we demonstrate that the resulting dystrophin is able to recover the correct <b>timing</b> of myogenic <b>marker</b> expression, to re-localize nNOS and to rescue expression of miRNAs previously shown {{to be sensitive to the}} Dystrophin-nNOS-HDAC 2 pathway. Becker mutations display different phenotypes, likely depending on whether the shorter protein is able to reconstitute the wide range of wild type functions. Among them, efficient assembly of the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC) and Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) localization are important. Comparing different Becker deletions we demonstrate the correlation between the ability of the mutant dystrophin to re-localize nNOS and the expression levels of two miRNAs, miR- 1 and miR 29 c, known to be involved in muscle homeostasis and to be controlled by the Dys-nNOS-HDAC 2 pathway. Since the gene responsible for the disease has been identified, several aberrant pathways have been characterized and many therapeutic approaches have been proposed to face all the symptoms associated to the pathology. What is now quite clear is that the best way to cure the disease is to apply different strategies in parallel, to enhance the beneficial effect that could be obtained from a single treatment. With this concept in mind we identified a microRNA, miR- 31, that is deregulated in DMD conditions if compared to a healthy control. This miRNA represses dystrophin expression by targeting its 3 â²UTR region. In human DMD myoblasts treated with exon skipping, we demonstrate that miR- 31 inhibition increases dystrophin rescue. These results indicate that interfering with miR- 31 activity can provide an ameliorating strategy for those DMD therapies that are aimed at efficiently recovering dystrophin synthesis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} future orientations of Oslo youth {{as they approach}} their twenties. It does so {{against the backdrop of}} theoretical debates over individualization, class, and youth. Theories of individualization highlight how a host of historical developments have expanded the scope of individual choice and reinforced the cultural ideals of individualism and self-realization. In parallel, the temporal window for navigating as an individual young person has been widened, as transitions into traditionally adult roles now tend to occur later than they did for previous generations. This is particularly so in the context of Oslo, where the average young person leaves the parental home at 20 and does not enter parenthood until after the age of 30. Theories of individualization and an individualized youth stage have been met with critique from a class and inequality perspective, with the charge that they overemphasize individual agency, and overlook the persistent impact of class backgrounds on life chances. Even in Norway where educational policy has specifically aimed to counteract such effects, class background continues to influence grades and aspirations. Although there are still proponents on both flanks rejecting the opposing view, there has been a convergence towards middle ground solutions, with a proliferation of attempts at integrating individualization and class perspectives. However, hybrids take myriad forms, and often remain at the abstract level. The dissertation aims for an empirically based integration of individualization and class perspectives. The overarching research questions that guide the three empirical articles are, how do Oslo youth in the transition away from high school navigate towards the future, and to what extent do future orientations differ for youth from dissimilar social backgrounds? These questions are investigated through statistical analyses of survey data collected when most respondents were 17 years old and in their second year of high school, and qualitative analyses of interview data collected when most participants were 19 years old and in their first post high school year. Where the survey data are well suited for identifying social patterns within the orientations of interest, the interview data provide a window into how participants make sense of their situation and make plans for the future. While individualization is both an institutional/objective and a cultural/subjective phenomenon, the findings indicate a schism whereby socioeconomic differences are miniscule in the domain of cultural ideals, but substantial in the domain of concrete plans and life choices. At the subjective level, Oslo youth tend to embrace the cultural ideals of individualism and self-realization â irrespective of their socioeconomic backgrounds. They hope to find work that is intrinsically meaningful, and tend to be more motivated by selfrealization than by the pursuit of wealth or prestige. They perceive the amount of options available to them as virtually limitless, and see hard work and determination as the most important factors for achieving their goals. At the same time however, the caveat must be added that their endorsement of individualist values does not prevent them from recognizing the relevance of unequally distributed family resources. Socioeconomic background plays a bigger part in the formation of concrete plans for the future â in their movement through the education system, in their plans for international mobility, and to some extent, in their expectations for the timing of transitions into traditionally adult roles. Statistical differences within these plans and expectations are likely to materialize into different objective outcomes. The relationship between class and education is already visible in the allocation to different high school programs, as well as in high school grades and college aspirations. Moreover, expectations for the <b>timing</b> of adult <b>markers</b> depend in part on class background and educational trajectory. Finally, while a large share of Oslo youth are eager to get out and see the world, plans for international mobility are substantially less frequent among those from working class backgrounds...|$|R
