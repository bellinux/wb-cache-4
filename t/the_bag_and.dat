5|$|While {{extremely}} severe {{commercial and}} recreational overfishing in the 1800s {{and the early}} 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, overfishing by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70centimetres and reducing <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department of Fisheries has introduced a maximum size limit of 75cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, {{as well as a}} new minimum size limit of 55cm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{improvement}} of the precision of classification algorithm results. Two various approaches are known: <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. This paper describes a set of experiments with <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods. Our use of these methods aims at classification algorithms generating decision trees. Results of performance tests focused {{on the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods in connection with binary decision trees are presented. The minimum number of decision trees, which enables an {{improvement of the}} classification performed by <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods, was found. The tests were carried out using the Reuter’s 21578 collection of documents as well as documents from an Internet portal of TV broadcasting company Markíza. The comparison of our results on testing <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting algorithms is presented. 1...|$|R

Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE (commonly known as Teflon).

A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof screed which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by pouring from <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> then tamping).|$|E

25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices for it, or worse, refused to sell it at all. The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson had acquired eleven thousand acres (45km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well out of <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> <b>and</b> anyone who had even a partial claim {{to any of the}} lands began to litigate.

The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E

One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a self-cleaning oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim. The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show.

We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
