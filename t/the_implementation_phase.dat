40|$|Takt {{time control}} is a widely used lean {{principle}} within repetitive environments. Its transparency and simplicity support the realization of short and reliable throughput times. This paper examines the applicability of a takt time concept designed for a non-repetitive or low volume high variety environment. An industrial case describes <b>the</b> <b>phased</b> <b>implementation</b> of <b>the</b> concept and shows its applicability and benefits in practice. A simulation study indicates {{the impact of the}} amount of work in process and the extent of processing variability on the performance of the concept in each of <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>phases.</b> <b>The</b> results show that the restrictions added with each <b>implementation</b> <b>phase</b> generally lead to some performance losses. However, if the amount of WIP set is sufficient, this degradation of performance is minimal. As in the industrial case, the benefits of the takt time concept will then most likely outweigh these small performance losses...|$|R
