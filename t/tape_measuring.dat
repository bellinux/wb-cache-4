40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop an}} {{experimental}} model of infravesical urinary obstruction in female rats. METHODS: After median caudal laparotomy, the urethra of 14 female rats was delicately {{separated from the}} vagina and loosely wrapped with cellophane <b>tape</b> <b>measuring</b> 0. 4 x 1. 0 cm. The animals were evaluated 4 (n= 7) and 8 (n= 7) weeks later. Five additional control animals were only subjected to separation of the urethra and vagina and monitored for 12 weeks. RESULTS: After four weeks, three rats presented vesical dilation associated with discrete ureteral ectasis in 2 animals, with the third presenting discrete hydronephrosis in one kidney. After eight weeks, five rats (71. 4 %) presented vesical distension with bilateral ureterohydronephrosis. No significant changes (p> 0. 05) in serum urea or creatinine occurred in any group compared to preoperative values. CONCLUSION: We present here an inexpensive and simple method for the slow induction of urethral obstruction in adult female rats, {{with the development of}} progressive vesical hypertrophy and ureterohydronephrosis, which may be used as an experimental model for the study of different aspects of obstructive nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|The current-voltage (I-V) {{curve is}} the basic {{characteristic}} of a superconducting wire or <b>tape.</b> <b>Measuring</b> I-V curves is generally problematic when samples have poor stabilization. Soldering voltage taps to an active part of the conductor affects {{the effectiveness of the}} local cooling and/or can be difficult to do in certain devices such as fault current limiters and cables where the tapes are closely packed. In order to overcome these problems, voltage taps can be placed outside the active area of the superconductor. We proved both by simulations and experiments that this arrangement leads to the same results as the standard four point method and it provides more detailed information for sample protection. The same arrangement can also be used for AC transport loss measurement. However in this case particular care has to be taken because the eddy current loss in the current leads contributes to the total measured loss. We used numerical simulations to evaluate the contribution of the eddy current loss to the measured AC loss. With help of simulations one can determine whether the contribution of the eddy current loss is significant and possibly optimize the current leads to reduce that loss contribution...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of the}} {{following}} study {{is to determine the}} effect of primary closure or dressing on post-operative morbidity after impacted lower third molar surgery. Materials and Methods: This was a randomized clinical study of 72 patients who had surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. The subjects were divided into two groups of A and B. Group A had total closure (primary closure) and Group B had whitehead varnish dressing of the socket. Pain, swelling and trismus were evaluated pre-operatively using visual analogue scale, flexible <b>tape</b> <b>measuring</b> method and inter-incisal distance measurement with Vernier Callipers respectively as well as post-operatively on 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 5 th and 7 th day. Results: The study participants consisted of 27 males and 45 females in a ratio 1 : 1. 7. With a mean age of 24. 7 ± 4. 9 years (range 19 - 33 years) for Group A and 25. 5 ± 4. 3 years (range 20 - 39 years) for Group B. Post-operative pain was not significantly affected by the closure techniques (P > 0. 05). Dressing was found to significantly reduce the degree of swelling and trismus peaking on the 2 nd day (P = 0. 0207 and P = 0. 010 respectively). Conclusion: The use of dressing was more effective than primary closure to reduce the degree of swelling and trismus though its effect on post-operative pain reduction was not significant...|$|E

40|$|In a roofing project, {{acquiring}} the underlying as-built 3 D geometry and visualizing the roof structure {{is needed in}} different phases of the project life-cycle. Architectural drawings, building information model (BIM) files, or aerial photogrammetry are used to estimate the roofing area in the bidding process. However, as a roof structure is never built to the exact drawing dimensions, as-built dimensions of boundaries of every roof plane have to be obtained {{several times during the}} course of its build. There are a number of surveying methods {{that can be used for}} this purpose: <b>tape</b> <b>measuring,</b> total station surveying, aerial photogrammetry, and laser scanning. However, obtaining measurements using these methods could be costly in terms of equipment, labor, and/or worker exposure to safety hazards. Aiming to address this limitation and provide roofing practitioners with an alternative roof surveying and visualization method that is simple to use, automated, inexpensive, and safe, a close-range videogrammetric roof 3 D reconstruction framework is presented in this research. When using this method, a roofing contractor will simply collect stereo video streams of a target roof. The captured data is processed to generate a 3 D wire-diagram for every roof plane. In this process, distinctive visual features of the scene (e. g., 2 D points and lines) are first automatically detected and matched between video frames. Matched features and the camera calibration information are used to compute an initial estimation of the 3 D structure. Then, a hybrid bundle adjustment algorithm is used to refine the result and acquire the geometry that has the maximum likelihood. Afterwards, different roof planes are found and a measurable 3 D wire-diagram is generated for each plane. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recently, {{an expert}} group advised to measure carotid-femoral (cf) pulse wave {{velocity}} (PWV) {{on the right}} side of the body, and to use a sliding caliper when <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> distance cannot be obtained in a straight line. The present study investigates the evidence for this advice by comparing the real travelled cf path lengths (RTPLs) at both body sides and comparing the straight distance (as can be obtained with a sliding caliper) with the <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> distance. Methods: RTPLs were measured with MRI in 98 individuals (49 men, age 21 - 76 years). Path lengths from the aortic arch to the carotid (AA-CA) and femoral (AA-FA) sites were determined. RTPL was calculated as (AA-FA) - (AA-CA) and compared between both sides. RTPLs were compared with 80 % of the direct cf distance using a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> and the straight cf distance obtained from MRI images. Results: RTPL was slightly longer [11 mm (12), P < 0. 001] at the right side. The 80 %-rule overestimated RTPLs with 0. 5 % at the right and 2. 7 % at the left side. Straight MRI distance tended (P = 0. 09) to perform slightly better than <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> distance. Conclusion: The travelled cf path is slightly longer at the right than at the left body side and the straight MRI distance tends to perform better than <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> distance. The present study supports the advice of the expert consensus group to measure cf-PWV at the right body side using a sliding caliper when <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> distance cannot be obtained in a straight line...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the agreement between lower limb volume measurements for the vertically oriented perometer and a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> method. Design: Between-methods agreement and test-retest reliability study. Setting: University setting. Participants: Thirty university staff and students were recruited using convenience sampling with no participant drop-outs. Interventions: All participants' dominant lower limb volumes were measured using the vertically oriented perometer and a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> method. Main outcome measures: The Bland-Altman difference plot was reported {{for determining the}} bias between the two methods and its 95 % confidence interval. Test-retest reliability and the measurement error for the perometer method were determined using the ICC(2, 1) model and within-subject standard deviation (sw) respectively. Results: There {{was a lack of}} agreement between the <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> and perometer method. The Bland-Altman difference plot showed that the <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> method overestimated limb volume by 157 ml compared to the perometer method. A 95 % confidence interval of - 834 ml to 519 ml was observed. The test-retest reliability of the perometer method was ICC(2, 1) = 0. 99. The measurement error of the perometer method was clinically acceptable (sw = 121 ml). Conclusions: There was a lack of agreement between the two methods investigated. Therefore the perometer and <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> methods are not interchangeable.
