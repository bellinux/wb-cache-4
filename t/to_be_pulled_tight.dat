5000|$|The idea of {{the cable}} tie came to Logan while touring a Boeing {{aircraft}} manufacturing facility in 1956. Aircraft wiring was a cumbersome and detailed undertaking, involving thousands of feet of wire organized on sheets of 50-foot long plywood and held in place with knotted, waxcoated, braided nylon cord. Each knot had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight</b> by wrapping the cord around one's finger which sometimes cut the operator's fingers until they developed thick calluses or [...] "hamburger hands." [...] Logan was convinced {{there had to be}} an easier, more forgiving, way to accomplish this critical task.|$|E
50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight</b> by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|E
50|$|Leather sleepsacks are {{generally}} very confining {{but do not}} stretch. If they are sized correctly they are very comfortable for long-term usage, and many bondage enthusiasts spend entire nights comfortably confined in them. In {{order to make the}} tightest fit possible, many leather sleepsacks have small D-rings down each side of the main zipper along the front of the sack, which allows the sack <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tighter</b> around the body using rope laced between the D-rings. This system of D-rings and rope lacing also protects the zipper from any stress that the occupant of the sack might exert on it. To further add to the confining aspects of the sleepsack, there are usually straps or belts that go around the body at intervals {{along the length of the}} sack, starting at the collar and going down to the ankles. To keep the straps in place and prevent them from shifting, they pass through larger D-rings down the sides of the sleepsack.|$|R

I have two sheets here, and two {{blankets}}. The bottom sheet <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight</b> all around the mattress, and the top sheet is folded down in a fold six inches wide over the blanket. The second blanket is folded in half and then in thirds and put under the pillow. The pillow is in the case very tight. With corners full. It rests on top of the folded blanket. The blanket has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the width of my hand away {{from the top of the}} sheet that’s folded back. The blankets have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> very <b>tight,</b> tight enough to bounce a quarter off of. I eat breakfast at 0625. We have to stand at attention in the mess hall, which works on the system of a cafeteria. The food here is swell, much better than that dump I just left. The tables seat six, 4 upperclassmen, and two plebs, that’s me. They are seated thus: [illustration] The [sic] at the head of the table, (B), sits at the attention and announces the beverages, for instance: “Sir the beverages for this meal are milk and water. ” We are then given “at ease”, and the pleb (A) proceeds to cut the butter into six equal shares, while (B) starts pouring the water, this is passed clockwise around the bales and the names of the upperclassmen for whom it’s intended announced. They wear white tags with their names on them over their left pocket. Ours are blue. If we want anything we snap to the sitting position of attention and say, for example, “Sir, does anyone care for the butter?” The upperclassmen will say, “Help yourself. ” And the meal proceeds in the same manner. I have to eat with both feet squarely on the floor, and my left hand on my knee. When I am finished I have to arrange my plate and silver a prescribed way and say, “Sir, may I be excused?” And I then march out of the hall, squaring all my corners. Our classes begin at 0800, they consist of Physics, history, English, and Aviation math. I will be here 221 / 2 weeks, and will be a pleb for 5 - 8 weeks, according to how good our group is. All a/s’s now take college for that length of time, no more of this 2, 3, or 5 month stuff. There are 1500 ways I can get giged. I am allowed 6 gigs a week, and for every gig over six I have to walk an hour on Saturday and Sunday. Excuse this messy letter hon, but my time is really cramped now. I have homework to do, a Lieutenant to get, and we have to see some G. I. movies tonight. I have 1 hour of P. T. a day. We have to buy special uniforms for this, they cost $ 9. 31, but consist of tennis shoes, sweat shirt pants, supporter, + Swimming trunks. I ran about 2 miles today. Saturday we run 12 miles!! Not all at once, but with short rests about every 20 minutes. Well darling, I’ve still got alot [sic] to tell you, but I have to sign off now, it’s almost 1900, and I have to shine my shoes, etc. Give my love to Biggie and Cynt.

40|$|While rope {{is arguably}} a simpler system to {{simulate}} than cloth, the real-time simulation of rope, and knot tying in particular, raise unique and difficult issues in contact detection and management. Some practical knots {{can only be}} achieved by complicated crossings of the rope, yielding multiple simultaneous contacts, especially when the rope <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight.</b> This paper describes a simulator allowing a user to grasp and smoothly manipulate a virtual rope and to tie arbitrary knots, including knots around other objects, in real-time. One component of the simulator precisely detects selfcollisions in the rope, as well as collisions with other objects. Another component manages collisions to prevent penetration, while making the rope slide with some friction along itself and other objects, so that knots can <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight</b> in believable manner. An additional module uses recent results from knot theory to identify which topological knots have been tied, also in real-time.

Thus the knot holds tension towards the inside of the loop rather than the standing end of the rope as with the taut-line - turning a tension knot into a constricting knot. After the knot is tied, the knot is held with one hand, the standing end <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>tight,</b> and the knot should hold fast.
