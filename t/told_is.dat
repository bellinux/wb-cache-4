40|$|Sixty {{preschool}} children {{were asked to}} perform either an objectively easy task which they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> easy for other children, an objectively easy task which they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> difficult for others, an objectively difficult task which they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> easy for others, or an objectively difficult task which they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> difficult. Their level {{of success and failure}} in achievement activity prior to performing this task was manipulated. Results indicated that when the task was either objectively difficult or allegedly difficult for other children, subjects who had failed on a previous task persevered longer than did subjects who had previously succeeded. However, when the task was both objectively easy and apparently easy for others, subjects who had previously been successful persevered longer than subjects who had previously failed. Results were inconsistent with achievement motivation theory (Atkinson, 1957), but were interpretable using an exchange formulation of behavior (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). © 1967...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am <b>told,</b> <b>is</b> practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E

500|$|The person {{most closely}} {{associated}} with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story <b>told</b> <b>is</b> that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which {{became known as the}} [...] "Poltalloch Terrier". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed. It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred. In 1903, Malcolm declared {{that he did not want}} to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed. The term [...] "West Highland White Terrier" [...] first appears in Otters and Otter Hunting by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.|$|E
500|$|The {{surprising}} release caused [...] "hilarious, {{honest and}} hysterical" [...] reaction among Beyoncé's fans, and [...] "shock" [...] among other musicians. According to {{data provided by}} Twitter, the release generated over 1.2million tweets in 12 hours. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield wrote, [...] "Beyoncé has delivered countless surprises in her 15 years {{on top of the}} music world, but she's never dropped a bombshell like this... The whole project is a celebration of the Beyoncé Philosophy, which basically boils down to the fact that Beyoncé can do anything the hell she wants to." [...] Peter Robinson of The Guardian hailed the shock release as [...] "Beyoncégeddon", describing it as a [...] "major triumph [...] a masterclass in both exerting and relinquishing control." [...] Forbes Zack O'Malley Greenburg included Beyoncé on his [...] "Music Industry Winners 2013" [...] list, noting that the singer [...] "didn't make use of any of the perks of —the [...] "machine" [...] we're <b>told</b> <b>is</b> so necessary.

500|$|Tenar, from whose {{perspective}} The Tombs of Atuan is <b>told,</b> <b>is</b> {{born on the}} Kargish {{island of}} Atuan before being taken away to serve the Nameless Ones as their high priestess. She is told {{that she is the}} reincarnation of the high priestess, and has lived at the tombs since time immemorial; though she believes this early in her life, she begins to question the idea later in the novel. For much of the book she is known only as Arha, or the [...] "Eaten one"; her identity as an individual is gradually erased. Though she is depicted as a person of strength and imagination, her development is stunted by the priestesses; her feelings are repressed, and her mind has no place to wander except the labyrinth. After trapping Ged, she talks to him about the rest of Earthsea, and begins to desire a life outside the barrenness of the Tombs. It is only after her escape that she seems to regain her name, crying [...] "I have my name back. I am Tenar!" [...] Tehanu, the fourth Earthsea novel, is narrated from Tenar's point of view; it depicts her life on Gont and her reunion and relationship with Ged. She reappears in The Other Wind, the sixth Earthsea book. Tenar plays the role of a heroine in The Tombs of Atuan, in which she is somewhat stereotypically cast as a [...] "side-kick" [...] to Ged, but later breaks out of this role to become a central character in her own right in Tehanu. Tenar is part of multiple pairs of characters that develop together; both Ged, in The Tombs of Atuan, and later Tehanu in her eponymous novel, are shown as being dependent on her.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific {{research}} has long demonstrated {{the power of}} suggestion in perception {{as well as the}} strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine.

French researcher Frédéric Brochet [...] "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." [...] Tasters described the supposed grand cru as [...] "woody, complex, and round" [...] and the supposed cheap wine as [...] "short, light, and faulty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The college {{remains a}} great rival of St John's which is its main {{competitor}} {{in sports and}} academia (John's is situated next to Trinity). This {{has given rise to}} a number of anecdotes and myths.

A far more likely reason remains the absence of the letter J in the Latin alphabet, and {{it should be noted that}} St John's College's older courts also lack J staircases. There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on the bowling green pointing in the direction of John's, though this orientation may be coincidental. Another story sometimes <b>told</b> <b>is</b> that the reason that the clock in Trinity Great Court strikes each hour twice is that the fellows of St John's once complained about the noise it made.|$|E

2500|$|A {{description}} of the pilgrimage is also present in a short story by Kipling called [...] "The Debt", which he wrote some years later and {{which was published in}} 1930. The story is set at the time of a serious chest infection that affected King George V in November 1928. News of the King's condition was broadcast to the nation and the Empire on the radio, and the story depicts the subsequent conversation and story-telling that takes place one evening between a 6-year-old boy, the son of a doctor at a colonial prison, and his carers for that evening, a household servant and one of the prison convicts. Among the stories <b>told</b> <b>is</b> one related by the convict, a tribesman and former soldier, as told to him by his Colonel. In this story, the convict describes the ordering of the construction of the war graves and the pilgrimage undertaken six years earlier by the King (referred to as [...] "the Padishah").|$|E

Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated [...] "Told sometimes feels like {{too much of}} a good thing; at 18 furious tracks, it’s overwhelming in the best sense.
