5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365.

This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
