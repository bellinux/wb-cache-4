25|$|Arthāpatti (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, {{derivation}} from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this pramana {{is similar}} to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this Pramana as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) {{announced}} {{its plans to}} automate the station, remove the light keepers, and transfer the island to {{the responsibility of the}} Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). This prompted the foundation of the Low Isles Preservation Society, a community organization with the purpose of protecting the island and the lighthouse. The light was eventually converted to solar power on March 1993, and as planned the station was demanned and the site was transferred to the QPWS. The lens which was removed at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> on display in the Court House Museum of Port Douglas. The last keeper left the island in 1994.|$|E

25|$|The states secrets {{privilege}} is {{a common}} law privilege originating with the judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases {{going back to the}} 19th century but more recently highlighted in United States v. Reynolds. In the criminal area, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides a relevant model for alternatives to full disclosure of classified information which allow a prosecution to continue while affording a defendant his or her due process rights. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> ripe for such legislation in the civil arena; litigants and their counsel are confused and unsure as to how to proceed in cases where the government raises the privilege; the courts themselves are confronted with precedent going in many different directions as to the scope of their authority and the requirements exercising it.|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E
500|$|The {{concentration}} of the killings around weekends and public holidays {{and within a few}} streets of each other has indicated to many that the Ripper was in regular employment and lived locally. Others have thought that the killer was an educated upper-class man, possibly a doctor or an aristocrat who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well-to-do area. Such theories draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession, mistrust of modern science, or the exploitation of the poor by the rich. Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names who were never considered in the police investigation. Everyone alive at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> dead, and modern authors are free to accuse anyone [...] "without any need for any supporting historical evidence". Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir Melville Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum, but the evidence against them is circumstantial at best.|$|E

2500|$|Sanders {{voted against}} the resolutions authorizing {{the use of force}} against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and opposed the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. Sanders voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, Sanders stated: [...] "The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> for a serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bolgia 5 – [...] Barrators: Corrupt politicians, {{who made}} money by {{trafficking}} in public offices (the political analogue of the simoniacs), are {{immersed in a}} lake of boiling pitch, which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals. They are guarded by demons called the Malebranche ("Evil Claws"), who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above {{the surface of the}} pitch. The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of Lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him. Virgil secures safe-conduct from the leader of the Malebranche, named Malacoda ("Evil Tail"). He informs them that the bridge across the Sixth Bolgia is shattered (as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ in 34 AD) but that there is another bridge further on. He sends a squad of demons led by Barbariccia to escort them safely. Based on details in this Canto (and if Christ's death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon), <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> 7:00 A.M. of Holy Saturday. The demons provide some savage and satirical black comedy – in the last line of Canto XXI, the sign for their march is provided by a fart: [...] "and he had made a trumpet of his ass".|$|E
2500|$|Chapter Five {{engages in}} a Plain-Meaning-Rule {{construction}} {{of the language of}} Section 7(a) and the NLRA. [...] Morris examines Section 7, Section 8(a)(1), Section 9(a), and Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRB for their plain meaning, and concludes they guarantee the right of all employees to bargain collectively, whether before or after majority-union designation. [...] Bargaining before such selection must be for members-only through a union of the employees' choice; bargaining after majority selection must be for all employees in the bargaining unit through the selected union only. [...] This chapter provides the heart of Morris' thesis, for although it is supported by legislative history (and constitutional and international law), its primary basis is contained in the unambiguous text of the statute. [...] The critical language is short, simple, and of clear meaning. [...] Fourteen words in Section 7, borrowed verbatim from Section 7(a) of the NIRA, provide that [...] "Employees shall have the right...to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing...." [...] This is guaranteed and enforced by Section 8(a)(1) and reinforced by Section 8(a)(5) (which by its clear wording and its [...] "smoking gun" [...] legislative history requires bargaining both before and after majority selection). [...] The only limitation on this bargaining right is a conditional limitation on the choice of representatives, but not on the duty to bargain. [...] This limitation is contained in Section 9(a) which does not operate unless there is a majority representative, in which event the selected majority union becomes the exclusive representative. [...] Morris points out that both the Supreme Court and the NLRB have approved minority and members only bargaining and resulting members-only contracts where they exist voluntarily, and that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> ripe for a decision confirming that such bargaining is enforceable where there is not yet a majority representative. [...] This universal concept of collective bargaining conforms to the [...] "policy of the United States" [...] expressed in Section 1 of the Act, which policy was expressly reconfirmed in the Taft-Hartley Act.|$|E
