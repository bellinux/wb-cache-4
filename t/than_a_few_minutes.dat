5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention for no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot.

40|$|A {{transient}} {{technique for}} seismograph calibration {{was developed and}} tested {{by a variety of}} methods. In the application of this technique a known transient {{in the form of an}} electrical signal is iniected, through (a) a Willmore-type calibration bridge or (b) an independent coil, into the seismometer and the corresponding output transient of the system is recorded. The ratio of the Fourier transform of this transient to that of the input pulse yields phase and rela-tive amplitude response of the seismograph as a function of period. Absolute amplitude re-sponse may be calculated if two easily determined constants of the seismometer are known. This technique makes practical the daily calibration of continuously-recording seismographs without disturbing the instruments more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The transient technique was tested and proven satisfactory with results of more conventional steady-state methods, using both digital and analog analyses of the output transients. A variety of output transients corresponding to various theoretical response curves has been calculated for two standard input transients. By comparison of the calculated output transients with experimental results it is possible to obtain the response of the instrument with consider-able precision quickly and without computation...|$|R
60|$|The {{noise of}} the tumult in {{the square of the}} convent aroused the whole town of Worcester. Alarm bells were rung; and the burgesses, hastily arming themselves, poured into the streets.

They speedily found that Sir Rudolph and his troop had departed; and further inquiry revealed the fact that the burgher guard at one of the gates had been overpowered and were prisoners in the watchroom. These could only say that they were suddenly seized, all being asleep save the one absolutely on guard. They knew nothing more <b>than</b> that <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later there was a great clatter of horsemen and men on foot leaving the city. Unable to find any solution to this singular circumstance, but satisfied that Sir Rudolph had departed, and that no more disturbance was likely to arise that night, the burgesses again betook themselves to their beds, having closed the gates and placed a strong guard over them, determining next morning to sift the affair to the bottom.|$|R

40|$|A {{moderately}} deep {{survey of}} stellar maser sources toward the Galactic center {{has been made}} in the SiO J= 1 - 0 v= 1 and v= 2 transitions (~ 43 GHz) with the Nobeyama 45 -m telescope of a beam size of about 40 ". At the Galactic center (Sgr A*), 7 (4 new) SiO maser sources were detected in one beam. In order to investigate the spatial distribution of SiO maser sources, we have also observed the offset positions by +- 40 " in Galactic longitude from the Galactic center. In total, 7 (4 new) SiO maser sources were detected at the offset positions. Taking into account the shorter integration time at the offset positions, we find that the surface number density of SiO maser sources is nearly constant at the Galactic center. The number density of SiO maser sources is found to be an order of magnitude higher than the density of OH 1612 MHz objects. A radial-velocity gradient in Galactic longitude was not detected. These facts indicate that the SiO maser sources seen toward the Galactic center are mostly associated with the stellar population of a Galactic stellar nuclear disk of more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> arc <b>minute</b> radius.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Accurately {{predicting}} {{the timing and}} location of tornadoes with lead times of more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of <b>minutes</b> {{will continue to be}} difficult, despite recent advances in numerical weather prediction. Tornadoes and the associated thunderstorms are smallscale phenomena, and the theory of chaos strongly suggests that such events will have {{a very short period of}} predictability (Lorenz 1969; Islam et al. 1993). However, many researchers have noted that tornadoes are typically associated with large CAPE (high buoyancy) and/or large vertical wind shear (e. g., Rasmussen and Blanchard 1998, and references therein). For lead times several hours or more, we thus aim for a more realistic goal <b>than</b> <b>a</b> precise prediction of timing and location: can we at least provide useful information on the likelihood of tornadoes based on CAPE and shear parameters from commonly available numerical forecast model output? To this end, we demonstrate here a technique to predict the conditional p...|$|R
