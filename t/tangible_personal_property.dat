40|$|Australia has new {{national}} legislation - the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Act 2009 (Cth) and the <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Regulations 2010 – which commenced operation on 30 January 2012. The policy {{objectives of the}} new legislation are to increase certainty and consistency and to reduce complexity and cost. To achieve this, the legislation treats like transactions alike, by focusing on substance over form, and so removes distinctions between security interests which {{have been based on}} their structure. Differences based on the location or nature of the secured property and the debtor’s legal form, as an individual or company, have also disappeared. We now have one single national scheme and one national electronic registration system for all security interests throughout Australia. The Act applies to security interests in <b>tangible</b> and intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property,</b> including those based on some form of title retention which are not security interests under the general law. This legislation rationalises previous laws and bring about substantial changes to this area of law. This paper seeks to explain the principal changes and their implications. ...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{and general}} exclusions, along with {{assessment}} practices, {{have made the}} <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> share of the general property tax base now smaller {{than at any time}} since the assumption of homogeneity emerged in the early 19 th century. Of the types of <b>tangible</b> and intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property,</b> only business depreciable fixed assets remain taxable in a majority of states. Evidence indicates that removing <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> from the base, rather than crippling fiscal capacity, permits higher property taxation possibly because governments feel less constrained by interstate competition after extracting a physically mobile element from the base, possibly because an inequity has been removed (arguments for <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> taxation being less clear than for real property), or possibly because businesses become less vigilant when this property is excluded. Because uniform taxation of all real and <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> may have significant logical and practical problems leading to <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> exclusion, separate state taxation of such property may be appropriate. Governments in the United States collected $ 142. 5 billion in fiscal 1989 from property taxes, $ 137. 1 billion of that going to local governments (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1990, 2). The taxes have survived the property tax revolt of the 1970 s, antitax sentiment of the 1980 s, and 20 years of ranking with the federal income tax as the &dquo;worst tax&dquo; in the annual Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (1990) poll of public attitude. In fact, movement away from the property tax has recently reversed: The property tax share of local general revenue was 2. 4 percentage point...|$|R
