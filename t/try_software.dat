50|$|The less {{derogatory}} term, from a shareware software producer's perspective, is feature-limited. Feature-limited {{is merely}} one mechanism for marketing shareware as a damaged good; others are time-limited, usage-limited, capacity-limited, nagware and output-limited. From the producer's standpoint, feature-limited allows customers to <b>try</b> <b>software</b> with no commitment instead {{of relying on}} questionable or possibly staged reviews.

40|$|Part 1 : IT PolicyInternational audiencePublic {{analysts in}} Sweden agreed in 1975 to {{investigate}} {{under what circumstances}} certain new types of communication services {{could be used in}} a regional and social perspective. Could new telecommunication services be successfully used for education, for local commercial services, regionally, and for social services? Would this possibly enhance regional functions, make distant regions more efficient, and possibly attractive? Local interest to participate was investigated in the North of Sweden. Economic and social empirical experiments of regional interest were then started. These experiments used computer conferencing based on computer terminals with acoustical modems. Video equipment was also <b>tried.</b> <b>Software</b> was acquired, adapted to Swedish form. The empirical social experiments continued until 1977. A separate evaluation was made.

5000|$|With jail it is {{possible}} to create various virtual machines, each having its own set of utilities installed and its own configuration.

50|$|A {{modification}} {{of this approach}} uses large regions of unreadable sectors with small islands of readable ones interspersed. Most <b>software</b> <b>trying</b> to copy protected media will skip intervals of sectors when confronted with unreadable ones, expecting them all to be bad. In contrast to the original approach, the protection scheme expects the sectors to be readable, supposing the medium to be a copy when read-errors occur.|$|R

50|$|Copy protections can {{use these}} fields as a {{distinctive}} feature by purposely crafting sectors with improper EDC/ECC fields during manufacture.

If the sectors forming the distinctive feature have become readable, the medium is presumed to be a copy.|$|R
