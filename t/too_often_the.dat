25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their secondary host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they sense when they bump into each other <b>too</b> <b>often.</b> <b>The</b> heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E
25|$|For the 1959 Formula One {{season the}} works cars were finally {{upgraded}} {{to the full}} 2.5-litre specification, and mechanical upgrades {{had been made to}} improve reliability. In addition to the works team, Lotus 16s had also been sold to a number of privateer entrants. As the season progressed the works cars were gradually developed still further, and their qualifying times began to fall. Reliability was still a major issue, however, and <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> cars failed to complete a full race distance. Although regular works driver Hill failed to finish even a single race during the season, his team-mate Innes Ireland's car held together long enough to take five World Championship points, with fourth place in the Dutch Grand Prix and fifth in the season finale in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Leibniz never married. He complained on {{occasion}} about money, but the fair sum {{he left to}} his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which {{put him in a}} bad light during the calculus controversy. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination. He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. On Leibniz's religious views, though he was a protestant, Leibniz learned to appreciate the good sides of Catholicism through his patrons and colleagues. He never admitted the Protestant view of Pope as an Antichrist. Leibniz was claimed as a philosophical theist.|$|E

There, {{the idea for}} a federation was finalised and settled, although the colonial governments had, again, insisted on amalgamation. They were rebuffed by the left-leaning public servant (later Sir) Andrew Cohen, who, after much deliberation, brought the parties to an agreement. It was acknowledged by those at the meeting that all <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> racial policies of the Rhodesias were confused with the emerging apartheid of South Africa, and Welensky himself claimed to refute these ideas when being interviewed by a South African newspaper. He was paternalistic towards native Africans, but believed in the dictum of [...] "equal rights for all civilised men" [...] and gradual advancement.|$|E
500|$|Jewel Summoner {{received}} mixed reviews. Its gameplay format, {{especially the}} premise of monster collecting, elicited frequent comparisons to Pokémon, a long-running Nintendo series of games. The gameplay itself was considered generic and unoriginal. IGN stated [...] "All <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> same battles happen again and again", and Game Informers reviewer said the battle system [...] "is as boring a turn-based snoozefest as I’ve seen in years". GameZone called Jewel Summoner [...] "prototypical" [...] and said the game [...] "does not stray {{too far from the}} formula. You fight, you level, you unlock new skills." [...] The process of improving monsters was described by GameSpot as too long and needlessly complicated, and IGN declared [...] "for the most part it's not even worth it." ...|$|E

[...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is <b>too</b> <b>often.</b> <b>The</b> name of Arsenal has been sullied {{and that is why}} I have taken this action." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Graham Keal of the Birmingham Post {{wrote of the}} first episode: [...] "Heretical as it might seem, I liked Holby City more than Casualty, not least because the formula {{is so much more}} flexible and unpredictable." [...] Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail praised the series for breaking away from the [...] "dreary sameness" [...] of Casualty, and for presenting [...] "a less hopeless view of the NHS." [...] His only concern about the series was its continuation of patient storylines from Casualty, writing: [...] "if that happens <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> new programme will soon lose its freshness and sparkle." [...] The Mirror Charlie Catchpole wrote that he was [...] "sick of the sensitive, hand–wringing, non–judgmental do–gooders who mope around the A department in Casualty", praising in comparison the [...] "pushy, ambitious, cynical and generally thoroughly unpleasant surgeons" [...] in Holby City.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there were}} some {{criticism}} directed at the list of drugs used in the chorus of [...] "Devil Pray".

[...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin also wrote about the [...] "laundry list of intoxicants" [...] referenced in the song, noting that it [...] "makes 'Devil Pray' sound like a mid-80s PSA." [...] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media went on to criticize the list for being [...] "a strange, tender, comical thing, [...] but ultimately, it's a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G, God. It's also a Madonna-doing-Madonna cliche , which is <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> downfall of Rebel Heart." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was negative about [...] "Devil Pray"'s production, claiming that [...] " [...] a pretty transparent attempt by Avicii {{to come up with something}} along the lines of his hit 'Wake Me Up'." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. He sent me to take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> toast of the town".|$|E

2500|$|Tom Easton, {{writing in}} Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, takes a {{different}} view, calling the book [...] "less good than its predecessors, partly because it is {{too much of a}} reprise. <b>Too</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> pages ask (and answer), [...] "Whatever happened to so and so?"
