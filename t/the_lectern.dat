5|$|The {{moment he}} starts to speak, not at <b>the</b> <b>lectern,</b> but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his {{listeners}} spellbound by his sparking personality, reflected in his small, dark eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{feature of the}} choir is the set of choir stalls, dating from about 1380, and {{described}} above. <b>The</b> <b>lectern,</b> {{in the form of}} a wooden eagle, symbol of John the Evangelist, dates from the first half of the 17thcentury. The candlesticks also date from the 17thcentury and are by Censore of Bologna who died in 1662.|$|E
5|$|The stone nave pulpit was {{designed}} by the restorer R.C.Hussey and <b>the</b> <b>lectern,</b> dated 1876, is by Skidmore. The mosaic floor of the tower bay {{was designed}} by Dean Howson and executed by Burke and Co. The same firm installed the mosaics which decorate {{the wall of the}} north aisle, depicting the patriarchs and prophets Abraham, Moses, David and Elijah. They were designed by J.R.Clayton of Clayton and Bell, and date from 1883 to 86.|$|E

5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. <b>The</b> <b>lectern</b> is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on <b>the</b> <b>lectern</b> before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|The nave and chancel {{are divided}} from the aisles by seven-bay arcades, the piers being without capitals. At {{the top of}} each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, {{including}} bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants. The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary. The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church. Between the nave and the chancel is a screen, and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels. The chancel screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The chancel stalls and the carved wooden eagle lectern date from around the same period. <b>The</b> <b>lectern</b> {{is one of the oldest}} eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom. The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person). Much of the furniture dates from the 17thcentury and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover. The font itself is Perpendicular. The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people {{that he was getting}} better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping <b>the</b> <b>lectern.</b> He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held <b>the</b> <b>lectern.</b>|$|E

25|$|Three rows {{of ancient}} marble Corinthian columns {{separate}} {{the northern and}} southern aisles and the nave from the narthex. A marble ambon is supported on four slender twisted columns.

25|$|Two {{years later}} they entered into a lease for some land on Amity Street. On that land they built the {{original}} 1834 Amity Street Baptist Church, a temple-style Greek Revival building with six Ionic columns along its front facade. Samuel Dunbar, the architect, {{is believed to have}} emulated his earlier design for the Thirteenth Street Presbyterian Church. Neither building is extant; <b>the</b> <b>lectern</b> in the current church, whose Greek Revival detailing suggests some of Minard LaFever's work, may be the only remnant of the original church.|$|E

50|$|In 1999 <b>the</b> Dunkeld <b>Lectern</b> mysteriously {{turned up}} in an Edinburgh arts centre after being missing for 15 years.

A permanent loan agreement is being negotiated between the National Museums of Scotland and the church of St Stephen's, still the legal owner of <b>the</b> Dunkeld <b>Lectern.</b>|$|R
25|$|The focus {{then moves}} from <b>the</b> <b>lectern</b> to the font. Anciently, Easter was {{considered}} the ideal time for converts to receive baptism, and this practice continues within Roman Catholicism and the Anglican Communion. Whether there are baptisms at this point or not, it is traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with holy water from the font. The Catholic sacrament of Confirmation is also celebrated at the Vigil.|$|E
25|$|Lanyon {{designed}} Sinclair Seaman's Presbyterian Church in 1856. Thomas Sinclair {{commissioned the}} church in memory of his father John Sinclair, who was a merchant from Belfast. Located on Corporation Square in Belfast's docks area, locally known as Sailortown, the church has a distinctive maritime theme. <b>The</b> <b>lectern</b> {{is made in the}} shape of a ship's prow. It also features a brass wheel and capstan from a World War I wreck, navigation lights from a Guinness barge, and the ship's bell from the pre-World War I battleship HMS Hood.|$|E
25|$|The new {{interior}} of 1959 under a wooden barrel vault is very plain. Behrmann {{created a new}} altar and a new pulpit. Eva Limberg (Bielefeld) designed the new christening bowl, the candlestick, carried by Apostle figures, and <b>the</b> <b>lectern,</b> depicting {{the scene of the}} Roman Centurion and Jesus. In 1958 August Wagner created new coloured windows above the altar, after the design of the Hermann Kirchberger. The windows depict the Benedictive Jesus, the Nativity of Jesus, and the Descent of the Holy Spirit (Pentecost). A surviving element of the original furnishing is a larger than life-sized copied statue of the benedictive Jesus after the famous statue by Bertel Thorvaldsen.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} pulpit {{was of the}} German-Dutch type, and its intarsia {{and other}} carving work suggests {{that it had been}} crafted either in Lübeck or by some North Germans residing in Gothenburg. It was replaced in the late 1670s and transferred to the newly built Kungälvs Church in 1682. Sculptor Marcus Jaeger the Elder carved the new pulpit with historical images in alabaster and ebony in 1674. He also made the baptismal font and executed numerous carvings on <b>the</b> <b>lecterns</b> and pews.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Oxford <b>Lectern</b> Bible was {{a massive}} edition of the English Bible {{designed}} by American typographer Bruce Rogers. The Bible, completed in 1935, was published by Oxford University Press. There were three sizes of the Bible printed. From the booklet An Account of the making of <b>the</b> Oxford <b>Lectern</b> Bible by Bruce Rogers, [...] "...for {{the size of the}} leaf, I now learned for the first time, must not exceed the standard dimensions of the folio Bibles used on <b>the</b> brass <b>lecterns</b> of most English churches — and this size was 12 x 16 inches. ... So I proposed to Mr. Milford that he have fifty copies printed for me on larger paper, preferably a hand-made, to which he readily agreed; and eventually two hundred copies were printed on Batchelor's paper in this form, in addition to the printing of 1000 copies on the smaller paper made at the Wolvercote Mill." ...|$|R

25|$|The rear {{sanctuary}} wall {{contains the}} glazed cross-shaped window, which has protruding metal fins attached on the interior. Below, the altar {{is located in}} the centre of a raised platform of three steps. The altar has a thick central base that inclines towards the top, clad in dark grey stones. A concrete cantilever angles out from the base to support the altar top, which is made from a terrazzo-like material incorporating pearl shell. Other items of furniture in the sanctuary include candlesticks, pulpit, lectern, and small stools and tables. The candlesticks are free-standing posts with a conical-shaped copper drip ring at the top. The timber pulpit has a protruding timber cross against a white background on the front face and sides that angle out towards the top, which has an angled book holder elevated on a tubular metal stand. <b>The</b> <b>lectern</b> is a simplified version of the pulpit but without the angled sides, and has an overhanging v-shaped top. A cupboard in the western wall of the sanctuary, the aumbry, has images of two saints on the inner face of the door leafs, made visible when opened.|$|E
25|$|The {{octagonal}} font is {{made from}} local sandstone. It has been dated to around 1280. It was placed on a circular plinth during the 1894–95 restoration. The altar {{is made from}} wood taken from the rood screen which was taken down at the Reformation. The screen under the tower arch dates from the 17thcentury. A pew behind the pulpit is dated 1607. In the church are seven hatchments {{on the walls of}} the nave relating to the Bold family, dating from 1762 to 1840. <b>The</b> <b>lectern</b> and pulpit date from the 1894–95 restoration. The stained glass in the north aisle dated 1876 was made by Morris & Co. and depicts the scene of the fiery furnace in the book of Daniel. The glass in the east window is by Burlison and Grylls, dated 1891, and that in the west window and in the east window in the transept are by Shrigley and Hunt. In the chancel are memorials to John and Edward Atherton who died respectively in 1826 and 1820 showing a sarcophagus in relief which is by T.Franceys and Spence of Liverpool. On the south wall is a pink marble tablet to the memory of the scientist Ferdinand Hurter who died in 1898.|$|E
