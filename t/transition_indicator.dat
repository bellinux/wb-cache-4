30|$|Simulation {{studies show}} that the {{obtained}} rectangular signals can suffer from local narrow spurious error windows which can be eliminated using a continuity assumption 1.2 in Appendix Appendix 1 : high-order statistics estimators and a continuity cleaning procedure called continuity process. In addition to these local narrow spurious error windows, estimated signals suffer another artifact called the two-step transition problem. After solving this problem using assumption 1.2 in Appendix Appendix 1 : high-order statistics estimators and a continuity procedure, an accurate <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> of non-stationary signals is achieved. Simulation studies corroborate the performance of our proposed algorithm and the accuracy of our non-stationary <b>transition</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this manuscript, a <b>transition</b> <b>{{indicator}}</b> for non-stationary signals is presented. The new indicator {{is based}} on HOS of quasi non-stationary variables (the random variables are considered stationary by parts). To estimate the HOS, unbiased adaptive exponential estimators are presented.|$|E
30|$|The HOS {{are much}} easier to be {{estimated}} than PDF, as will be shown in the next section. For this reason, our non-stationary <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> {{is based on the}} second- and fourth-order statistics. In fact, the transition of non-stationary random variable can generate discontinuity in its HOS. As the variance of any signal should be different than zero, then {{it can be used to}} identify the existence of signals. On the other hand, normalized signals have the same unit variance. Therefore, the variance is not enough to identify the transition in a general case. Besides that, the fourth-order cumulants of Gaussian signals are zeros. For these reasons, we developed a non-stationary <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> based on the variance and the fourth-order cumulant.|$|E

40|$|The {{open pit}} to {{underground}} transition problem involves {{the decision of}} when, how and at what depth to transition from open pit (OP) to underground (UG). However, the current criteria guiding {{the process of the}} OP – UG transition are not well defined and documented as most mines rely on their project feasibility teams’ experiences. In addition, the methodologies used to address this problem have been based on deterministic approaches. The deterministic approaches cannot address the practicalities that mining companies face during decision-making, such as uncertainties in the geological models and optimisation parameters, thus rendering deterministic solutions inadequate. In order to address these shortcomings, this research reviewed the OP – UG transition problem from a stochastic or probabilistic perspective. To address the uncertainties in the geological models, simulated models were generated and used. In this study, <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> used for the OP - UG transition were Net Present Value (NPV), ratio of price to cost per ounce of gold, stripping ratio, processed ounces and average grade at the run of mine pad. These indicators were used to compare four individual case study mines; with AngloGold Ashanti’s Sunrise Dam Gold Mine in Australia, which made the OP – UG transition in 2004 and hence develop an OP – UG transition model. Sunrise Dam Gold Mine is a suitable mine for providing baseline values because it recently made the OP-UG transition. Only four case study mines were used because it took nine months to generate <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> for each case study mine. A generic model was developed from the results of the four case studies to help mining companies make the OP - UG transition decision. The model uses a set of <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> that trigger the decision while recognising the uncertainties in the geological models, future mineral price as well as cost and processing parameters. From the generic model, mines can transition when the margin (gold price to cost per ounce ratio) is greater than 2. 0; grade is between 4 g/t and 9 g/t, stripping ratio between 3 and 15 m 3 /t and positive NPV {{depending on the type of}} deposit. With this model mines can now transition when the critical conditions of the <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> (gold price to cost per ounce, grade and stripping ratio) are achieved. The model also uses the set of <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> to model the probabilistic nature of the OP-UG interface. The derived generic model will help mining companies in their annual reviews to assess the OP - UG interface and make decisions early enough with regard to transition timing...|$|R

After regaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan implemented economic transition process toward market economy. In the first years of independence, serious economic recession was observed. However, after 1995, the restructuring of the economy started. In this sense, signing the “Contract of the Century ” was a turning point toward oil based high speed economic growth or oil boom period. Thus, by opening “Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan ” pipeline in 2005, Azerbaijan’s macroeconomic indicators experienced considerable growth for the following years. On the other hand, Azerbaijan officially declared the end of economic transition process in its economy in 2009. In this paper, the authors discuss the political-economic and economic process in the whole period as well as analyze the macroeconomic performance with and without oil & gas contribution.

The methodology offers the opportunity to build a single transition measure, capable {{to take into account}} the idiosyncratic (e. g., region specific) characteristics of the labor market. The analysis focuses on universities in Campania (one of the most economically important Southern Italy regions), being part of a recently completed (fall 2015) statistical project designed to study labor market dynamics and university performance. This is relevant since our sample can be considered a proxy for Southern Italy, and probably for Southern European regions, for the duality of the labor market, the presence of a large underground sector, the characteristics of labor demand side (small firms, operating into manufacturing). The paper shows that these universities rank just below the average value of the <b>transition</b> <b>indicator.</b> We identify two main reasons: (i) the lack of contractual instruments that allow adequate work and training experience that should have been acquired during the college years; (ii) the relatively low labor demand for highly educated workers due to the production structure concentrated on traditional manufacturing sectors (and by this end, characterized by intensive use of unskilled labor).

To answer this question, we use an innovative approach based on a new concept of the institutions-augmented Solow model which is then estimated empirically using regression equations. The analysis covers 180 countries during the 1993 - 2012 period. The empirical analysis confirms a large positive impact {{of the quality of}} institutional environment on the level of economic development. The positive link has been evidenced for all five institutional indicators: two indices of economic freedom (Heritage Foundation and Fraser Institute), the governance indicator (World Bank), the democracy index (Freedom House), and the EBRD <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> for post-socialist countries. Differences in physical capital, human capital, and institutional environment explain about 70 - 75 % of the worldwide differences in economic development. The institutions-augmented Solow model, however, performs slightly poorer in explaining differences in the rates of economic growth: only one institutional variable (index of economic freedom) has a statistically significant impact on economic growth. In terms of originality, this paper extends the theoretical analysis of the Solow model by including institutions, on the one hand, and shows a comprehensive empirical analysis of the impact of various institutional indicators on both the level of development and the pace of economic growth, on the other.

40|$|String {{correlations}} are {{investigated in}} an infinite-size XXZ spin- 1 chain. By using the infinite matrix product state representation, we calculate a long-range string order. In the XY phase, the string correlations decay within a relatively very large lattice distance, {{which makes a}} finite-size study difficult to verify the non-existence of the string order. Thus, in the Haldane phase, the non-vanishing string correlations {{in the limit of}} a very large distance allow to characterize the phase boundaries to the XY phase and the Neel phase, which implies that the transverse long-range string order is the order parameter for the Haldane phase. In addition, the singular behaviors of the von Neumann entropy and the fidelity per lattice site are shown to capture clearly the phase transition points that are consistent with the results from the string order. The estimated critical points including a BKT transition from the XY phase to the Haldane phase agree well with the previous results: Δ_c 2 = 0 for the XY-Haldane phase transition and Δ_c 3 = 1. 185 for the Haldane-N'eel phase transition from the density renormalization group. From a finite-entanglement scaling of the von Neumann entropy with respect to the truncation dimension, the central charges are found to be c ≃ 1. 0 at Δ_c 2 = 0 and c ≃ 0. 5 at Δ_c 3 = 1. 185, respectively, which shows that the XY-Haldane phase transition at Δ_c 2 = 0 belongs to the Heisenberg universality class, while the Haldane-Neel phase transition at Δ_c 2 = 1. 185 belongs to the two-dimensional classical Ising universality class. It is also shown that, the long-range order parameters and the von Neumann entropy, as well as the fidelity per site approach, can be applied to characterize quantum phase transitions as a universal phase <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> for one-dimensional lattice many-body systems.

We {{examine the impact of}} serious crashes on the longer-term health of car drivers, independent of natural variation, in a population-based study in Auckland, New Zealand. METHODS: The study population comprised 218 car drivers surviving nonfatal crashes in Auckland, in which at least 1 occupant in the vehicle was admitted to a hospital, and a representative sample of 254 car drivers in the region, recruited from roadside surveys. All participants were interviewed at recruitment (subjects reported their precrash health) and 5 and 18 months later. The drivers' changes in health were obtained with a global health <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> and the Short Form- 36, with analyses adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with 7 % of drivers in the comparison group, 43 % of crash drivers admitted to the hospital (adjusted odds ratio 10. 4; 95 % confidence interval 5. 5 to 19. 6) and 20 % of those not admitted (odds ratio 3. 3; 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 to 8. 3) reported that their overall health at 18 -month follow-up was worse than at baseline (precrash). Among the drivers reporting worsened health, prospectively ascertained Short Form- 36 scores revealed greater reductions in physical health in those admitted after the crash, but these scores improved from 5 to 18 months. In contrast, mental and general health scores worsened from 5 to 18 months in admitted and nonadmitted crash drivers. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of drivers surviving serious crashes experience reductions in longer-term health, a burden likely to be underappreciated among those not admitted to a hospital. Emergency departments could serve as useful settings in which to develop and validate clinical decision rules that can help target services for crash survivors at increased risk of adverse outcomes...|$|E

The National Child Development Study (NCDS) originated in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (see SN 5565), which examined social and obstetric factors associated with still birth and infant mortality among over 17, 000 babies born in Britain in one week in March 1958. Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999 / 2000 (age 41 / 2 - SN 5578), 2004 - 2005 (age 46 / 47 - SN 5579), 2008 - 2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669). There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10 % representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002 - 2004, 9, 340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004 / 2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the NCDS series page for details. Further information about the NCDS {{can be found on}} the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. The ESRC-funded Partnership Histories project was concerned with preparation of continuous partnership histories for female members of the NCDS aged 16 - 42, using data collected at three sweeps of the study - age 23 years (NCDS 4), 33 (NCDS 5) and 42 (NCDS 6). It is based on the linkage of the consolidated NCDS 4 and NCDS 5 dataset (Di Salvo, 1995) and the NCDS 6 deposited data. The resulting dataset, which includes cohort members with at least one partnership in either NCDS 5 or NCDS 6, has been used for the analysis of the link between partnership and childbearing processes. The data were derived from existing deposited data using a Stata algorithm described in the accompanying documentation (see the CLS Cohort Studies Data Note 5 publication). A corresponding dataset for the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS 70) series was also produced during the project, and is held at the UKDA under SN 5218. For the second edition (August 2008), the serial number has been replaced with a new one, variable Ncdsid. This change has been made for all datasets in the NCDS series. Further information may be found in the 'CLS Confidentiality and Data Security Review', included in the documentation. An updated version of the Partnership Histories dataset is now available from the Archive under SN 6940 - National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories, 1974 - 2008. The updated file includes partnership histories for both men and women for all NCDS sweeps from sweep 5 (age 33) to sweep 8 (age 50). Additionally overlapping partnerships and cohort members with same sex partnerships are now included as well as data on partner attributes or divorce. Main Topics : Each record in the dataset provides details of the start and end dates of each partnership episode of female cohort members, together with information on the nature of the partnership (cohabitation or marriage), and the type of transition to another state (separation, death of partner or marriage). Dataset variables are as follows: serial: NCDS longitudinal identifier s: partnership state including single state b: episode beginning (year-month format) e: episode ending (year-month format) t: <b>transition</b> <b>indicator</b> alt: alteration of at least an episode of cohort member imp: imputation of at least an episode of cohort member </ul...|$|E

The federal government established State Performance Plan Indicator # 13 (SPP 13) so that states would report {{the percentage of students}} with Individualized Education Programs whose goals and transition services reasonably enable the student to meet measurable post-secondary goals. In New York State, <b>Transition</b> Quality <b>Indicators</b> (TQI) were established to help school districts collaboratively assess their current transition-related practices. TransQUAL Online is a password-protected organizational assessment tool that integrates the TQI with planning and reflection tools and resources, supporting a continuous improvement approach. The author identifies a process by which a school district planning team can infuse SPP 13 data into the TransQUAL collaborative process, bringing this mandated review into a broader context. Tables are included that directly link <b>Transition</b> Quality <b>Indicators</b> to elements of the SPP 13 measurement tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from socialism to capitalism {{has spawned a}} large literature on comparative policy reforms. While many sociologists using qualitative data have concluded that neo-liberal reforms led to negative outcomes, {{a large body of}} cross-national literature, mostly from economics and political science, claims that more neo-liberal reforms produced better economic and political outcomes. These latter studies almost all use measures of policy reform constructed by economists at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). We show, using the EBRD’s own data, that their indices of progress in market reforms are biased in the direction of positive growth. That is, the EBRD’s bureaucracy over-codes the more successful countries. When one accounts for this bias, the relationship between the EBRD’s <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> and growth significantly weakens or disappears. These findings have implications for social scientific research using statistics constructed by �international organizations, like the World Bank and the IMF. sociology of knowledge, transition, bias...|$|R
40|$|To improve {{product quality}} and reduce cost, batch {{production}} is often implemented in many flexible manufacturing systems. However, the current literature {{does not provide}} any method to analyze the quality performance in a flexible manufacturing system with batch production. In this research, we present an analytical method with closed-form formula to evaluate the quality performance in such systems. Based on the model, we discover and investigate monotonic and non-monotonic properties in quality to provide prac-tical guidance for operation management. To improve product quality, we introduce the notions of quality improvability with respect to product sequencing. In addition, we develop the indicators for quality improvability based on the data available {{on the factory floor}} rather than complicated calculations. We define the bottleneck sequence and bottleneck transition as the ones that impede quality in the strongest manner, investigate the sensitivity of quality performance with respect to sequences and tran-sitions, and propose quality bottleneck sequence and <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> based o...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is not to examine in the details the {{assessment}} made by the Commission but rather, drawing on the research basis and the methodology of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as reflected inter alia in the EBRD Transition Report 2000 published November 2000, to assess the progress achieved by the ten candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe in their transition to a market economy. The paper is organized as follows. In the first section, we review the EBRD system of <b>transition</b> <b>indicators</b> and its application to the ten candidate countries. In the second section, we try to understand the factors that could explain discrepancies in the progress achieved by individual countries, while, in section three, we reflect on the key role of institutional performance in transition and on the lessons learned as we embark in a new decade of transition. Additional EBRD material is proposed in annexes 1, 2 and 3, dealing with legal, infrastructure and environmental transition...|$|R
