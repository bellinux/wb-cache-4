He sought to give residents {{a sense of place}} and belonging, replicating the good relations between neighbours which he noticed in traditional Victorian terraced streets. Each dwelling was a maisonette rather than a flat, similar inside to an East End house. Unlike a flat slab or tower block, he designed Keeling House with four wings that each look onto another, encouraging contact between neighbours. Between the central lift tower and the front doors of the apartments, tenants had to pass communal 'drying areas' for laundry and storage, where he hoped that social interchange would be as natural as in the streets below. However, he also designed the homes for privacy; the balconies face outward and do not look onto one another.|$|E

Professor Vernadsky is a Russian refugee and {{has not been able to}} throw off an anti-Bolshevik bias. For example, in discussing the Five Year Plan he says, ”In some branches the quality of manufactured products fell below that of output before the war by 30, 40 or even 50 per cent”. This is obviously a guess: quality of such various goods as are produced in Russia cannot be reduced to a percentage.

40|$|The 1992 - 95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina created deep ethnic {{divisions}} in alreadyfragmented university structures, where individual faculties possessed considerable academic and financial independence. The faculties, in turn, in the Humboldtian tradition, were composed of semi-autonomous "chairs" and institutes. This {{level of the}} organisation had gained added autonomy in the Communist period from the distinctive Yugoslav "self-management" principle, intended to empower operating units.

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} or absence of use-wear marks on copper (Cu) -alloy weaponry has been used since the late 1990 s to investigate the balance between functional (combat) and symbolic (value, status, religious) use of these objects, and thus explore their social and economic context. In this paper, we suggest that this work has not <b>taken</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the material properties of Cu-alloys. We discuss mechanisms of plastic deformation, incremental repairs and corrosion in detail to show how these can obscure use-wear traces. In a survey of Cu-alloy weaponry from the Nordic Bronze Age (1800 / 1700 – 550 BCE) from Denmark, Sweden and Germany, we show that corrosion of Cu-alloy objects is strongly linked to depositional context, being greater in burials (both inhumations and cremations) than hoards or as single objects. A relative paucity of use-wear marks on burial weapons should therefore not be used to argue that these were purely symbolic objects, e. g. in contrast to the better preserved hoard material. We propose that use-wear traces on Cu-alloy weaponry, particularly on blade edges, is significantly more elusive than previously realised, and that undamaged objects have been over-identified...|$|R

The current research identifies those teacher qualities likely to sustain teacher effectiveness and the learner's performance and smooth insertion onto the labour market.

Hence, laudable educational initiatives should <b>take</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> those competences and features that could frame a “quality English teacher” and lead to quality assurance in engineering students’ language performance, a prerequisite for their successful professional mobility...|$|E

40|$|Urban water scoping {{modelling}} {{packages are}} used as tools to inform decision makers of the sustainability of different water management options for a city. Previous scoping models have not <b>taken</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> natural systems in the urban environment and are often limited {{in terms of the}} range of indicators used to measure sustainability and the choice of water management options offered. A new modelling package, named City Water Balance, has been developed to address these limitations. It has the capability to assess the sustainability of a variety of water management options, including the sustainable urban drainage systems, in terms of water flow, water quality, whole life cost and life cycle energy for alternative scenarios of future urban land use, population and climate. Application of the modelling package to the City of Birmingham has demonstrated that the modelled components can describe adequately the existing system, giving confidence that it can be used for scoping strategic options for future water supply and wastewater management. The further application of the package to model alternative scenarios through to 2055 for Birmingham has also been undertaken to illustrate its application. The results from the different analyses have shown that medium scale rainwater harvesting and borehole abstraction are predicted to be more sustainable than the conventional centralised supply and that medium scale wastewater recycling would be more cost effective but less energy efficient. The most sustainable strategy was installation of water efficient appliances as there is the potential for large energy savings from reduced indoor usage and consequent water heating requirements.

Modern techniques for longitudinal data analysis {{can be helpful in}} examining differential effects of psychological interventions on specific subpopulations of patients. Methods: Outpatients in mental health care, diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, were randomly assigned to cognitive behavior therapy (N = 199) or treatment as usual (N = 226). Every 3 months for a total of 1. 5 years, depressive symptomatology was measured using the SCL- 90. Growth mixture modeling techniques were used to identify different trajectory classes of patients. The impact of type of treatment (treatment as usual vs. cognitive behavior therapy) was examined for each identified trajectory. Results: On average, patients in both test conditions improved significantly from baseline to posttest, and no significant difference was found between the conditions. However, four different trajectory classes could be distinguished within the sample. Most patients were classified into the two classes with the lowest depression scores at baseline (31 % and 33 % of the total sample). For these two classes, no significant differences in the course of depressive symptoms were found between the two conditions. In the two classes with the more severe depression scores (10 % and 26 % of the sample), however, cognitive behavior therapy was significantly more effective than treatment as usual.
