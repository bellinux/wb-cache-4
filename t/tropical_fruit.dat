5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers who sought to {{strengthen}} the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit,</b> and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a police state.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits,</b> both in fresh and {{processed}} form, and on the influence of socio-demographic, psychosocial and socio-environmental factors on their consumption and purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire-based survey (n = 290) was used to gain insight in the perceived importance of different food choice determinants (i. e. familiarity with <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits,</b> attitude and beliefs towards this food category, influence of social norm and socio-demographic characteristics), and their role on the intention to purchase <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits.</b> Data analysis consisted of descriptive analyses and statistical validation. Findings – Familiarity with <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits</b> differs and depends on consumers’ product-related experiences. <b>Tropical</b> <b>fruits</b> are perceived as nutritious, healthy, good in taste, attractive and special. Socio-demographic characteristics, such as gender, place of living and travel experience outside Europe, associate with product familiarity, consumers’ general attitude and beliefs, and the purchasing intention of <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits.</b> Originality/value – This paper covers a previously rather unexplored, even neglected research topic, namely consumers’ attitude and behavioural intention towards fresh and processed <b>tropical</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R

5|$|Richard Fitzpatrick, by {{that time}} the owner of a {{successful}} plantation with coconut and lime trees, plantains, and sugarcane, pressed for the appointment of Cooley as Justice of the Peace in 1831, making Cooley responsible for adjudicating disputes of persons and property, punishment of minor offenders by fines and whippings, and oversight of the activities of wreckers. Serious offenders were jailed in Key West. By that time, Cooley owned a schooner and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade coontie, sugarcane, and <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> with Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West and Havana.|$|E
5|$|Flood {{waters in}} Miami-Dade County covered about 40,000acres (160km²) of farmland. The damage was worsened since the {{flooding}} {{occurred at the}} beginning of the planting period for the winter season. Flooded nurseries and fields resulted in about $500million in agricultural damage, including $60million in <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> and $397million in ornamental crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 16Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, Collier, and Palm Beach, as primary disaster areas due to flooding, making farmers and their families there eligible for USDA emergency farm loans. The same agency made 22 other counties, including Broward, eligible for loans due to their proximity to the disaster areas.|$|E
5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E

5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of vitamin C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E

25|$|Recorded history {{began when}} the United States Life Saving Service built the Orange Grove House of Refuge in 1876.

25|$|The Chardonnay grape {{itself is}} very neutral, {{with many of}} the flavors {{commonly}} associated with the grape being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak, and <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> notes such as banana and mango come out. Wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation tend to have softer acidity and fruit flavors with buttery mouthfeel and hazelnut notes.|$|E

25|$|Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fruit. Because they cannot tolerate frost, <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> such as citrus, bananas, and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots). Gooseberries (agrastai) and currants (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts.|$|E
