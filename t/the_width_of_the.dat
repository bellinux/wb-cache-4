5|$|The flag {{proportions}} are not fixed, but 3:5 is {{most commonly}} used, {{as with other}} flags of {{the countries of the}} United Kingdom. (Flag manufacturers themselves may adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3). Lord Lyon King of Arms states that 5:4 is suitable. The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bars of the saltire in relation to <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width. However, this ratio, though not rigid, is specified as one-third to one-fifth of <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west on modern NY37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E
5|$|In June 1874, {{the whole}} of Northumberland House was {{purchased}} by the Metropolitan Board of Works and demolished to form Northumberland Avenue, which would accommodate hotels. Contemporary planning permissions forbade hotels to be taller than <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road they were on; consequently Northumberland Avenue was built with a wide carriageway. Part of the parallel Northumberland Street was demolished {{in order to make}} way for the avenue's eastern end. The street was open by 1876. The hotels were popular for American visitors as they were near to the West End, government buildings on Whitehall and all the mainline stations.|$|E

5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, {{to cover the}} left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out}} of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof, were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs.
