5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend <b>the</b> <b>Abbot.</b> Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and <b>the</b> <b>Abbot,</b> while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as <b>the</b> <b>Abbot</b> tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>abbot</b> then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, <b>the</b> <b>Abbot</b> presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E
5|$|Bloet {{was one of}} {{the chief}} {{administrative}} officers of the kingdom under William II, often associated with Ranulf Flambard, Urse d'Abetot, and Haimo the dapifer. As a bishop, he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead. This church was considered a proprietary church and the bishops of Lincoln retained the right to appoint <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> and installing <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> in office. The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor. Bloet also gave the manor of Charleton to the priory of Bermondsey, which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus' reign.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{struggled}} with <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> of Battle Abbey {{for many years}} over the exemption claimed by the abbey from the oversight of the Bishop of Chichester, in whose diocese it was located. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England, and its status as an eigenkirche, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated <b>the</b> <b>abbot,</b> who appealed to the papacy. The appeal backfired however, as Hilary obtained from both Pope Eugenius III and Pope Hadrian IV orders for <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> to obey the bishop. In 1157, the then Abbot of Battle, Walter de Lucy, brother of Richard de Luci the Chief Justiciar, took the case before King Henry II, at a council held at Colchester.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the large income <b>the</b> <b>Abbot</b> was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick appears to have not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered that the number of canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{gifts of}} estates {{to support the}} abbey, many {{exemptions}} were granted to <b>the</b> <b>abbots,</b> to free them from interference from local bishops: the exemptions were confirmed in 855 by Pope Benedict III. <b>The</b> <b>abbots</b> ranked as counts and {{had the privilege of}} a mint.|$|R
50|$|In 1394, Pope Boniface IX {{elevated}} it to a diocese, with <b>the</b> <b>abbots</b> {{functioning as}} bishops.

5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-eighth century, Iona and Ireland had {{accepted}} Roman practices. Iona's {{place as the}} centre of Scottish Christianity was disrupted {{by the arrival of}} the Vikings, first as raiders, then as conquerors. Iona was sacked by Vikings 795 and 802. In 806 68 monks were killed and the next year <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> withdrew to Kells in Ireland, taking the relics of St. Columba with him. There were periodic returns of abbots and relics, often ending in more massacres. Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and the Hebrides eventually fell to the Pagan Norsemen, curtailing the influence of the church in the Highlands and Islands. The threat posed by the Vikings may have forced a union between the kingdoms of Dál Riata and the Picts under Kenneth mac Alpin, traditionally dated to 843. In 849, according to the Annals of Ulster <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> of Iona once again took Columba's relics to Ireland, but the earliest version of the Chronicles of the Kings of Scots says that in the same year they were removed by Kenneth mac Alpin, to a church he had built, probably at Dunkeld, perhaps indicating that the relics were divided. <b>The</b> <b>abbot</b> of the new monastery at Dunkeld emerged as the Bishop of the new combined Kingdom of Alba, which would subsequently {{come to be known as}} the Kingdom of Scotland.|$|E

5000|$|In his abbey chronicle {{which first}} {{appeared}} in 1551, the theologian and historian, Kaspar Brusch, left a record of <b>the</b> <b>abbots</b> of Weissenburg, {{which appears to be}} partly fictitious (at least for <b>the</b> <b>abbots</b> who presided before Dragobodo - to wit the rather stylized name of <b>the</b> supposed first <b>abbot,</b> [...] "Principius"). In addition Brusch suggests this himself ("Nihil enim de his Abbatibus primis aliud scriptum reperi, quorum seriem etiam ac successionem aliquid erroris habere non dubito". As the source for <b>the</b> <b>abbots</b> before Adalbertus (No. 23) he discloses that he was given this information by the Bishop of Speyer of that time).|$|R

5|$|Flooding of {{adjacent}} moor {{land was}} partially addressed during the 13thcentury by {{the construction of}} a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett.

5|$|In the 14th century, only Westminster Abbey {{was more}} richly endowed and {{appointed}} than Glastonbury. <b>The</b> <b>abbot</b> of Glastonbury kept great state, now attested to simply by {{the ruins of}} the Abbot's Kitchen, with four huge fireplaces at its corners. The kitchen was part of the magnificent abbot's house begun under Abbot John de Breynton (1334–42). It {{is one of the best}} preserved medieval kitchens in Europe, and the only substantial monastic building surviving at Glastonbury. Archaeological excavations have revealed a special apartment erected at the south end of the abbot's house for a visit from Henry VII, who visited <b>the</b> <b>abbot</b> in a royal progress, as he visited any other great territorial magnate. The conditions of life in England during the Wars of the Roses became so unsettled that a wall was built around the abbey's precincts.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was acting as <b>the</b> <b>abbot's</b> diocesan bishop, {{appears to have}} been tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as <b>the</b> <b>abbot's</b> confessor. <b>The</b> fact that the Evesham's house chronicle {{appears to have been}} reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of <b>the</b> <b>abbots</b> submitting to <b>the</b> bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|R
