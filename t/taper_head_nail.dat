50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full <b>head</b> <b>nail</b> guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped <b>head</b> so the <b>nails</b> can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round <b>Head</b> <b>nails</b> and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R

Enhanced photoresponse {{could be due}} to large concentrations of intrinsic structural defects such as oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials that are detected from visible PL emission. From our CFCOM gas synthesis technique, we have grown ZnO nanorods with <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> facets at a rapid rate of 100 nm/s in just 15 s whereby the quenching stage could be crucial in retaining the <b>tapered</b> <b>heads.</b> Unstable <b>tapered</b> facets such as planes of { 5220 }, { 3110 }, { 4110 } and { 5110 } could be a contributing factor in the rapid growth rate of CFCOM ZnO rods due to their faster growth rates and high surface energies.

5000|$|The largest {{sizes of}} {{conventional}} collated fastenings are the clipped head and full <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> {{which are used}} in framing, fencing {{and other forms of}} structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a shank diameter of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to [...] in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20° to 21° for full head, 28° to 34° for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.|$|R

The ventral abdomen and the femurs of the long thin walking legs have distinct lobules, which serve as camouflage. Due to its bizarre shape and the yellowish-green striped pattern of the legs, E. fasciata is well-camouflaged in vegetation, and is noticeable only when in motion.|$|R

50|$|Dik-diks are herbivores. Their diet mainly {{consists}} of foliage, shoots, fruit and berries, but {{little or no}} grass. They receive sufficient amounts of water from their food, which makes drinking unnecessary. Like all even-toed ungulates, they digest their food {{with the aid of}} micro-organisms in their four-chambered stomachs. After initial digestion, the food is repeatedly eructated and rechewed, a process known also as rumination, or 'chewing the cud'. Dik-diks' <b>tapering</b> <b>heads</b> may help them eat the leaves between the spines on the acacia trees, and feed while still keeping their head high to detect predators.|$|R

Like T. californicus and all living tapirs, it {{is believed to have been}} a relatively solitary species. Of the four known Pleistocene-era tapirs found on the North American continent, T. merriami was the largest. T. merriami was a stout-bodied herbivore with short legs, a large, <b>tapering</b> <b>head,</b> and a short, muscular proboscis adept at stripping leaves from shrubs.|$|R
50|$|A pin is {{a device}} used for {{fastening}} objects or material together. Pins often have two components: a long body and sharp tip made of steel, or occasionally copper or brass, {{and a larger}} head often made of plastic. The sharpened body penetrates the material, while the larger head provides a driving surface. It is formed by drawing out a thin wire, sharpening the tip, and adding a <b>head.</b> <b>Nails</b> are related, but are typically larger. In machines and engineering, pins are commonly used as pivots, hinges, shafts, jigs, and fixtures to locate or hold parts.|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids are synthetic compounds {{based on}} the structure of testosterone, and are used to treat various conditions such as reproductive system dysfunction. High doses of anabolic androgenic steroids and exercise influence the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis, which can, in turn, affect testicular apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of anabolic androgenic steroids on semen parameters in bodybuilders (heavy exercise) in Erbil city. Methods: Semen specimens and serum were collected from 150 which divided into three groups; each consists of 50 men. The control group (A) didn't practice exercise so didn't receive nandrolone. The exercise group (B) who practice daily without taking nandrolone. The exercise and treated group (C) who practice exercise and had been using nandrolone (200 mg- wk- 1, intramuscularly) for at least three months. Smear prepared by methyline blue stain and assessment of semen volume, sperm morphology, sperm concentration,motility were carried out. Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were also carried out. Results: There was no difference in the semen volume within three groups. Sperm concentration and the percentage of sperm motility in the group C was significantly lower (P < 0. 001) than that in the other groups. A significantly increased percentage of sperm with the <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> was found in the group C. Our results also demonstrated a significant decrease in testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone in the group C compared to group A and B. Conclusion: Users of anabolic-androgenic steroids have sperm with abnormal shape, especially <b>tapered</b> <b>head,</b> and low concentration of sperm with sluggish motility attributing to infertility...|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after its}} completion, the pier started {{to suffer from}} damage caused by gribble worms {{resulting}} in the foundations needing to be rebuilt in 1838. In an attempt to prevent further gribble damage the pier's pilings were covered in large <b>headed</b> <b>nails</b> which it was hoped would rust and provide the pier with a protective coating. In 1847 a horse-drawn tramway was constructed to link the pier to Southampton Terminus railway station. In 1871 the tramway was extended {{to the end of}} the pier with a single platform station being built there. In 1876 the trams switched from being horse-drawn to using light steam locomotives. In 1888 the pier was given a new gatehouse.|$|R
