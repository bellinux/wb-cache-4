5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local codes of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E
500|$|The {{war ended}} {{shortly after the}} Battle of Dien Bien Phu and {{the signing of the}} 1954 Geneva Accords. France agreed to {{withdraw}} its forces from all its colonies in French Indochina, while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel, with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh, and the south becoming the State of Vietnam, nominally under Emperor Bảo Đại, preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country. The refusal of Ngô Đình Diệm (the US-supported President of [...] the first Republic of Vietnam (RVN)) to allow elections in 1956, as had been stipulated by the Geneva Conference, eventually led to {{the first phase of the}} Second Indochina War. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> known as the Vietnam War, which was waged largely by the United States after 1963.|$|E

He described the climax of the ride the [...] "most amazing effect". Bill Dean of The Ledger described the ride as the [...] "most impressive" [...] attraction at Islands of Adventure. Guests interviewed by Dean praised the ride with comments including [...] "I loved it", [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> [...] because of the 3-D effects", and [...] "it was so exciting and everything was happening all at once, so it was really, really good".

500|$|... "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{included}} the chorus in his polka medley [...] "Polka Face" [...] from his 2011 album Alpocalypse. The song was parodied by British comedy group The Midnight Beast. The parody discusses youthful {{subjects such as}} attempting to view the nude bodies of women and dodging parents' anger. After Kesha discovered the parody, she {{left a message on}} her Twitter account: [...] "holy. shit. <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than my version." [...] Released to iTunes on January 15, 2010, the song peaked at number four on the Australian Singles Chart, and at thirty-nine on the Irish Singles Chart. Comedian Julie Brown parodied the song with the single [...] "Another Drunk Chick" [...] on her album Smell the Glamour (2011). Jarett Wiselman [...] of The New York Post stated it was [...] "one of the year's best comedy albums."

In Australia, melanoma is the third most common cancer in either sex; indeed, its incidence is higher than for lung cancer, although the latter accounts for more deaths.

2500|$|The {{capacity}} of canyons to focus and concentrate organic matter can promote high abundances {{and diversity of}} fauna. [...] However, variability in environmental conditions and topography is very high, both within and between canyons, and this {{is reflected in the}} variability of the structure and dynamics of the biological communities. [...] Our understanding of biological processes in canyons has greatly improved with the use of submersibles and ROVs, but this research has also revealed that the relationships between fauna and canyons are more complex than previously thought. [...] The diversity of submarine canyons and their fauna means {{that it is difficult to}} make generalisations that can be used to create policies for canyon ecosystem management. [...] It is important that the role of canyons in maintaining biodiversity, and how potential anthropogenic impacts may affect <b>this,</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> understood. [...] HERMIONE will address this challenge by examining canyon ecosystems from different biogeochemical provinces and topographic settings, in light of the complex interactions among habitat (topography, water masses, currents), mass and energy transfer, and biological communities.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 April 1975, Ham {{received}} a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o'clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: [...] "Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>better.</b> Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me". Ham had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning cigarettes on his hands and arms. He was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham's daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death. [...] In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved. [...] Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger's albums from its catalogue.|$|E
