500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out,</b> we cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{fired his}} manager Eric Greif after Spiritual Healing but settled and re-hired {{him before the}} {{recording}} of Human. Although {{there were at least}} two lawsuits between Greif and Schuldiner, Schuldiner was characteristically mellow in an interview with Thrash 'n Burn about what the writer referred to as his [...] "gruesome collaboration" [...] with Greif: [...] "We just {{came to the conclusion that}} it was stupid just fighting all the time, taking each other to court and all that stupid shit." [...] "Fate has an interesting way of working <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out...</b> Yes, we had a falling out, but we're working together again and it takes a lot of worries off my mind knowing Eric is the man for us", Schuldiner told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, [...] "The definition of 'rock and roll' means {{different things to}} different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music." [...] Roger Glover remains ambivalent about induction and got an inside word from the Hall, [...] "One of the jurors said, ‘You know, Deep Purple, they’re just one-hit wonders.’ How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?". Ian Gillan also commented, [...] "I've fought all my life against being institutionalised and I think you have to actively search <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out,</b> in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things." [...] On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.|$|E
6000|$|The manager met {{him with}} [...] "Ah, I'm {{glad you came}} soon. <b>These</b> <b>things</b> fade <b>out</b> of one's mind so, and I {{really want to talk}} about your play. I've been very much {{interested}} in it." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{inspired}} by [...] "Shoes", yeah — the bulk of that tune I kind of remembered from being a kid while {{it was on the}} English charts. I liked the electric piano—it stuck in my subconscious. It's funny how <b>these</b> <b>things</b> come <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|By <b>these</b> three <b>things,</b> then, <b>out</b> of this book, thou, who art not saved, must at last {{be judged}} and overcome.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{reflected}} that as, {{from what she}} had said, Rachel certainly would think <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out,</b> it might be as well to help her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{very good}} man must live here," [...] she said, [...] "to put all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> for us to see! I can smell them through the glass!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>These</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> of the way, her {{thoughts}} {{turned to the}} matter of the greater dread; that of which all along she had feared to think for a moment: Harold! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We might accept {{three hundred}} dollars for the shaking up we got-- {{although}} we don't know if our nerves are all right or not. Sometimes <b>these</b> <b>things</b> turn <b>out</b> worse than at first anticipated. But the railroad has got {{to pay for the}} biplane it smashed." ...|$|R
60|$|Every one {{who visited}} him was {{received}} like a prince, entertained like a king, given a present fit for an emperor, and sent away happy. The fame of all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> went <b>out</b> {{through all the}} land, and every one talked of him and the magnificence that surrounded him.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you believe}} that? You're a college girl, mother tells me. Don't the belief in <b>these</b> <b>things</b> wipe <b>out</b> {{everything}} you have been taught at school? It certainly rips science into strips for me, or would--if I believed it. It makes a fool of a man like Boyden, that's a sure thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that depends}} upon circumstances," [...] said the Captain, who wasn't {{going to be}} posed; [...] "but let me jist see your book you've been reading <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor any {{particular}} good," [...] {{a man who}} was standing by his side interrupted. [...] "Say, Phil, you drag <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> too much. Are there any questions you've got to ask 'em, or any property to collect?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember that at {{this moment}} I am asking you for nothing," [...] he said. [...] "Just think <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out.</b> It isn't really a matter for sorrow," [...] he continued. [...] "Love must always mean happiness--for {{the one who is}} loved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse than that. I {{really feel}} a little responsible. I always told you Miss Brooke would be such a fine match. I {{knew there was a}} great deal of {{nonsense}} in her--a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But <b>these</b> <b>things</b> wear <b>out</b> of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means frost-bitten hands if <b>these</b> <b>things</b> give <b>out,</b> {{and they}} won't stand much more," [...] he said. [...] "The {{worst of it}} is that you think we'll find we have wasted our labor {{when we get to the}} top. I believe I could feel cheerful if I could see Mappin {{crawling}} up after us." ...|$|R
6000|$|He goes on. [...] "Talk to Harding. Get {{it out of}} him. You {{women can}} do <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Find <b>out</b> what the trouble is and let me know. I must help him." [...] (A pause. Sir John is {{speaking}} almost to himself--and the gallery.) [...] "I promised his mother when she sent him home, sent him to England, that I would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're the man {{who used}} to own this place, aren't you?" [...] asked Niven, with a sidelong glance. [...] "Should have thought {{you would have had}} enough of it; but you might as well help heave <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out,</b> now you're here." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack. Oh! one doesn't blurt <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> to people. Cecily and Gwendolen are {{perfectly}} {{certain to be}} extremely great friends. I'll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, boy," [...] said Peg good-humouredly, [...] "the only {{difference}} between me and other folks is that I say <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> loud and they just think them. If I told yez all the things I know about {{the people in this}} congregation you'd be amazed. Have a peppermint?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, marking <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> Jarl threw <b>out</b> the thought, {{that the}} more wind, and the less current, the better; and if a long calm came on, of which there was some prospect, we had better take to our oars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} reading a corking book. Have you ever read <b>these</b> <b>things?</b> They come <b>out</b> every month, and they're corking. The fellow who writes them {{must be a}} corker. It beats me how he thinks of <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> They are about a detective--a chap called Gridley Quayle. Frightfully exciting!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>These</b> <b>things</b> drove Ann <b>out</b> of {{mind for}} a time. But at last, as they drifted without {{food or water}} upon a {{stagnant}} ocean, haggard-eyed, chins between their hands, looking in vain for a sail, she came to mind again abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see that," [...] agreed Mr. Hoopdriver. He MUST help her. Within {{his skull}} {{he was doing}} some {{intricate}} arithmetic with five pounds six and twopence. In some vague way he inferred from all this that Jessie was trying to escape from an undesirable marriage, but was saying <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> of modesty. His circle of ideas was so limited.|$|E
6000|$|... “Nowadays {{there is}} no demand for marvellous things that have really happened,” said Crosby discouragingly; “the {{professional}} writers of fiction turn <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> so much better. For instance, my neighbours tell me wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and borzois have done; I never listen to them. On the other hand, I have read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’ three times.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{might have}} {{branched}} <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> into several particulars, but I would be brief. I say, therefore, {{the office of}} the priest was to carry the blood into the holy place, and there to present it before the mercy-seat, with his heart full of intercessions for the people for whom he was a priest (Luke 1:8-11). This is Jesus Christ's work now in the Kingdom of Glory, to plead His own blood, the nature and virtue of it, with a perpetual intercession to the God of Mercy on behalf of us poor miserable sinners (Heb 7:25).|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> were dug <b>out</b> from {{heaps of}} stones and rubbish," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "a few hundred years ago. For nearly a {{thousand}} years before that time, they were regarded as of no more value than so many old bricks.|$|R
5000|$|A {{witness to}} the first drop {{on the island of}} Agrigan said [...] "We saw <b>these</b> <b>things</b> come <b>out</b> {{of the back of the}} {{airplane}} and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm tellin' you straight, Miss Withersteen, fer I {{want you}} to know. Afterward you'll git over it. I've seen some soul-rackin' scenes on this Utah border, {{but this was the}} awfulest. I {{remember}} I closed my eyes, an' fer a minute I thought of the strangest <b>things,</b> <b>out</b> of place there, such as you'd never dream would come to mind. I saw the sage, an' runnin' hosses--an' thet's the beautfulest sight to me--an' I saw dim things in the dark, an' {{there was a kind of}} hummin' in my ears. An' I remember distinctly--fer it was what made all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> whirl <b>out</b> of my mind an' opened my eyes--I remember distinctly it was the smell of gunpowder.|$|R
6000|$|... "There they are, hard at {{work with}} the honey," [...] he said, {{speaking}} in English, and pointing at the bees. [...] "Little do they think, as they undermine that comb, how near they are to the undermining of their own hive! But {{so it is with}} us all! When we think we are in the highest prosperity we may be nearest to a fall, and when we are poorest and hum-blest, we may be about to be exalted. I often think of <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>out</b> here in the wilderness, when I'm alone, and my thoughts are acTYVE." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, dogma. But we must argue {{this out}} in comfort. It is our supper hour, and I'm {{not the man}} to fight against {{accomplished}} facts. We have intermarried. There it is. You must stop to supper--and you and I must thresh <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out.</b> We've involved ourselves {{with each other and}} we've got {{to make the best of}} it. Your wife and mine will spread the board, and we will go on talking. Why not sit in that chair instead of leaning on the back? This is a home--domus--not a debating society--humble in spite of my manifest frauds.... That's better. And in the first place I hope--I do so hope"--Chaffery was suddenly very impressive--"that you're not a Dissenter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, man, {{when you}} were my Lady's minion, men held you proud, and some thought you a Papist, and I wot not what; and so, {{now that you have}} no one to bear you out, you must be companionable and hearty, and wait on the minister's examinations, and put <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> of folk's head; and if he says you are in fault, you must jouk your head to the stream; and if a gentleman, or a gentleman's gentleman, give you a rough word, or a light blow, you must only say, thank you for dusting my doublet, or the like, as I have done by you.--But hark to Woodcock's whistle again. Come, and I will teach you all the trick on't as we go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{see that}} I am {{beginning}} upon a very comprehensive scale, for I propose to bring {{within the scope}} of this conference all that arises <b>out</b> of <b>these</b> two <b>things,</b> <b>out</b> of the realization of the incompleteness of man's individual life {{on the one hand and}} out of the realization of a greater being in which man lives, of a larger racial life and ampler references upon the other. All this much--and with a full awareness of just how much it is--I am going to claim as literature and our province. Religion, I hold, every religion so far as it establishes and carries ideas, is literature, philosophy is literature, science is literature; a pamphlet or a leading article. I put all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> together----' ...|$|R
30|$|I like to turn all {{the lights}} off and hide behind the slides. They’re not looking at me, they’re looking at the slides. I’m really shy. So having {{to get up there}} and do <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that are <b>out</b> of my comfort zone like stop in the middle of lecture and give them time to work on their own, that’s hard for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is an {{excellent}} old gentleman, I must own," [...] replied M'Intyre, [...] "and I am enraged at myself when I chance to offend him; but then his eternal harangues upon topics not worth the spark of a flint--his investigations about invalided pots and pans and tobacco-stoppers past service--all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> put me <b>out</b> of patience. I have something of Hotspur in me, sister, I must confess." ...|$|R
