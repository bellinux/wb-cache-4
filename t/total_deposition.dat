30|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Since 1990 the UN ECE Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys provide data {{inventories}} of the atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulation in mosses across Europe. In the 2005 survey the nitrogen accumulation was measured {{for the first}} time in most of the participating countries. In Germany, the surveys were conducted in close cooperation with the relevant authorities of both the Federal Republic and the sixteen states. Therefore, statistical evaluations of the moss survey data with regard to the whole German territory and single federal states are of interest. This article concentrates on the federal state Baden-Württemberg, dealing with the mapping of the spatiotemporal trends of metal accumulation from 1990 to 2005, the spatial patterns of nitrogen accumulation in 2005, and the spatial variability of bioaccumulation due to characteristics of the sampling sites and their surroundings. Furthermore, {{for the first time}} the relationship between the element concentrations in the mosses and Europe-wide modelled data on <b>total</b> <b>depositions</b> from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) on <b>total</b> <b>depositions</b> and were evaluated by means of correlation analysis using lead as an example.

Volume weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of SigmaPBDE (9 congeners) in rain were 209 pg l(- 1). <b>Total</b> <b>deposition</b> rates were 2 +/- 1 ng SigmaPBDE m(- 2) day(- 1). The total PBDE deposition was dominated by decaBDE(209) and thereafter 2, 2 ' 4, 4 '-tetraBDE(47) and 2, 2 ' 4, 4 ', 5 -pentaBDE(99).

However, the status of P deposition in China is poorly understood. This study synthesized data on total P and total N concentrations in bulk precipitation and throughfall from published literature to assess the characteristics of P deposition, N deposition and N : P deposition ratio in China's forests. Our results show relatively high mean rates of bulk P deposition (0. 38  kg P ha − 1  yr − 1) and total P deposition (0. 69  kg P ha − 1  yr − 1), but they were accompanied by even more elevated N inputs via bulk deposition (16. 5  kg N ha − 1  yr − 1) and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> (21. 6  kg N ha − 1  yr − 1), resulting in high N : P ratios in bulk deposition (44. 4) and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> (32. 8).

40|$|ABSTRACT Wetlands have {{recently}} been used to help filter out nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, in water to reduce the rates of eutrophication in water bodies.

40|$|The dry {{deposition}} of particle {{from the atmosphere}} is not well understood for reasons of surface variabilities and mutual interactions between surface and particle. However, even relatively simple influences of physical parameters have so far resisted successful parameterization, although some progress has been achieved. There is no general way to determine the relative contributions of stochastic turbulent and Brownian diffusion and directed motions (i. e. sedimentation) to the <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> velocity since they contribute in a nonlinear manner to the <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> velocity.

30|$|ConclusionsThe {{fact that}} no {{correlations}} {{were found between the}} modelled <b>total</b> <b>depositions</b> and the element concentrations in the mosses may be caused by the low spatial resolution (50 [*]×[*] 50  km) of the EMEP data. The moss surveys contribute to the heavy metal and the multi-component-model of CLRTAP because they prove on different spatial scales how air pollution control influences the accumulation of emitted substances in environmental subjects of protection like vegetation. In contrast to deposition measurement networks the moss monitoring identified a trend reversal in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The continuous decrease of the metal bioaccumulation in mosses from 1990 till 2000 has changed to an increase of several metals between 2000 and 2005.

40|$|Data {{collected}} in the eastern US between 1990 and 2009 at 34 paired dry and wet monitoring sites are examined. A goal is to evaluate the air quality impacts occurring between 1990 and 2009 {{that are associated with}} concurrent legislatively mandated changes in emissions. Four 5 -year periods, 1990 – 1994 (P 1), 1995 – 1999 (P 2), 2000 – 2004 (P 3), and 2005 – 2009 (P 4) are considered, with a primary focus on P 1 -to-P 4 changes. Results suggest that legislatively mandated air pollution mitigation strategies have been successful in improving air quality and reducing atmospheric deposition in the eastern US. Respective P 1 -to-P 4 reductions of estimated sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) emissions in the eastern US are 50 and 42 %. Corresponding behavior of the following metrics associated with these emissions reductions is examined: monitored atmospheric concentrations of SO 2, aerosol sulfate (SO 4), and oxidized sulfur (S); dry, wet, and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of S; monitored atmospheric concentrations of nitric acid (HNO 3), aerosol nitrate (NO 3), and their sum, oxidized nitrogen (OxN); dry, wet, and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of OxN; monitored atmospheric concentration of aerosol ammonium (NH 4); dry, wet, and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of NH 4; summed monitored atmospheric concentration of oxidized and reduced nitrogen (N); dry, wet, and <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of N; wet deposition of hydrogen ion (H +); monitored atmospheric concentration of ozone (O 3); dry deposition of O 3; and the summed monitored atmospheric concentration of aerosol NO 3, SO 4, and NH 4 (Clean Air Status and Trends Network particulate matter – CASTNET PM). Other metrics (e. g., ratios of dry to <b>total</b> <b>deposition)</b> are also considered. Selected period-to-period changes of air quality and deposition metrics at site, regional, and seasonal scales are discussed. As an example, despite P 1 -to-P 3 reductions in estimated emissions of both SO 2 and NO x, aerosol NO 3 concentration increased in the east, with widespread wintertime numerical increases in both aerosol NO 3 concentration and CASTNET PM. However, a reversal of this behavior is associated with continuing P 3 -to-P 4 reductions of SO 2 and NO x emissions. Thus, additional P 3 -to-P 4 reductions of these emissions, especially NO x, appear to have made progress in altering the chemical regime of the wintertime eastern US atmosphere so that future emissions reductions and their resulting reductions in aerosol concentrations may no longer be accompanied by sub-linear changes (or actual increases) in CASTNET PM...|$|E
40|$|The Yangtze River basin {{is one of}} the world's {{hotspots}} for nitrogen (N) deposition {{and likely}} {{plays an important role in}} China's riverine N output. Here we constructed a basin-scale total dissolved inorganic N (DIN) deposition (bulk plus dry) pattern based on published data at 100 observational sites between 2000 and 2014, and assessed the relative contributions of different reactive N (Nr) emission sectors to <b>total</b> DIN <b>deposition</b> using the GEOS-Chem model. Our results show a significant spatial variation in <b>total</b> DIN <b>deposition</b> across the Yangtze River basin (33. 2 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 on average), with the highest fluxes occurring mainly in the central basin (e. g., Sichuan, Hubei and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing municipality). This indicates that controlling N deposition should build on mitigation strategies according to local conditions, namely, implementation of stricter control of Nr emissions in N deposition hotspots but moderate control in the areas with low N <b>deposition</b> levels. <b>Total</b> DIN <b>deposition</b> in approximately 82 % of the basin area exceeded the critical load of N deposition for semi-natural ecosystems along the basin. On the basin scale, the dominant source of DIN deposition is fertilizer use (40 %) relative to livestock (11 %), industry (13 %), power plant (9 %), transportation (9 %), and others (18 %, which is the sum of contributions from human waste, residential activities, soil, lighting and biomass burning), suggesting that reducing NH 3 emissions from improper fertilizer (including chemical and organic fertilizer) application should be a priority in curbing N deposition. This, together with distinct spatial variations in emission sector contributions to <b>total</b> DIN <b>deposition</b> also suggest that, in addition to fertilizer, major emission sectors in different regions of the basin should be considered when developing synergistic control measures...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric sulfur (S) {{deposition}} via precipitation, {{particles and}} gases was investigated at ten sites in Northern China. Measurements were performed continuously between December 2007 and November 2010. The <b>total</b> S <b>deposition</b> flux {{in the target}} area ranged from 35. 0 to 100. 7 kg S ha − 1 yr − 1, noticeably higher than the values documented in Europe, North America, and East Asia. The ten-site, 3 -yr average <b>total</b> S <b>deposition</b> was 64. 8 kg S ha − 1 yr − 1, with 68 % attributed to dry deposition (mainly SO 2) and the rest to wet deposition. Consequently, the spatial distribution of the total flux was consistent to that of dry deposition, that is, higher values were observed at industrial and urban sites than at agricultural and rural sites. However, the seasonal variation in the <b>total</b> S <b>deposition</b> was not obvious across the entire year because of opposite seasonal trends in wet and dry deposition. It {{was found that the}} wet deposition, without significant spatial and interannual differences, was influenced by the volume of precipitation, the air-column concentrations of S compounds and in-cloud scavenging. Similar to the wet deposition, the dry-deposited sulfate was also less dependent on the surface concentration. Nevertheless, the regional differences in SO 2 dry deposition were mostly explained by the ambient concentration, which is closely associated with local emissions. As expected, the spatial pattern of <b>total</b> S <b>deposition</b> resembled that of the emission inventory, indicating the dramatic anthropogenic imprints on the regional S budget. Although at most of the study sites the "acid equivalents" deposition of S was comparable to that of nitrogen (N), the importance of S in the acidification risks was more pronounced at the industrial sites. The ten-site, 3 -yr mean <b>total</b> "acid equivalents" <b>deposition</b> of S and N was estimated to be 8. 4 (range: 4. 2 – 11. 6) keq ha − 1 yr − 1, which exceeds the critical loads for natural ecosystems in Northern China.

40|$|The {{effect of}} rock {{fragment}} eccentricity on the deposition of airborne dust was examined in a wind tunnel. Eccentricity {{was defined as}} the ratio a/b, where a is the longest and b the intermediate axis of the rock fragments. The effect of eccentricity on the deposition of dust on the pebbles, on the deposition of dust between and underneath the pebbles, and on <b>total</b> dust <b>deposition</b> (pebbles + interpebble space) was measured separately, and this for different values of pebble size, pebble flattening, cover density and wind speed. The more pebbles are elongated, the larger dust deposition on them will be. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become larger, as they become less flattened, and as wind speed increases, but no correlation is observed with cover density. It also holds that the more pebbles are elongated, the less dust settles between and underneath them. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become smaller and cover density becomes larger, but there is no relationship with pebble flattening. Whether or not there is a relationship with wind speed is unclear. Pebble eccentricity indirectly influences <b>total</b> dust <b>deposition</b> on a pebble field, since it determines whether or not (and to what extent) <b>total</b> dust <b>deposition</b> will be a function of pebble size. For circular pebbles, <b>total</b> dust <b>deposition</b> is independent of pebble size, but once pebbles become elongated, <b>total</b> dust <b>deposition</b> will be smaller on pebble fields composed of small pebbles than on pebble fields composed of large pebbles. It was also demonstrated that the more pebbles are elongated, the more the dust will tend to settle on the pebbles rather than between or underneath them. Air flow separation plays a primary role in the deposition of dust on a rock fragment field, since it determines the location and size of the low-sedimentation areas that are connected to the air flow separation bubbles. Highly-elongated pebbles oriented parallel to the wind catch much more dust (also per unit surface) than circular pebbles, the surface of which is largely located in a zone of very low deposition. Dust deposition density on highly-elongated pebbles normal to the wind, on the contrary, is equal to dust deposition on circular pebbles. It should be noted that all data in this study refer to initial dust deposition (not accumulation), since only wind velocities below the dust deflation threshold were tested. status: publishe...|$|R

In this paper a short {{overview of the}} main results is given and they are applied in generalisation of deposition in The Netherlands. The results of the Aerosol project show that the deposition of particles to forests has been underestimated until now. Particle deposition makes a reasonable contribution to the <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of acidifying components and base cations to forests. Parametrisations of the deposition processes were derived from the experiments and model developed for particle deposition to Speulder forest. The parametrisations were used together with concentrations, meteorological observations and land-use data to determine the deposition on a 5 x 5 km basis in The Netherlands. Results of the canopy exchange experiments at Speulder forest and of the comparison of atmospheric deposition estimates and throughfall estimates at Speuld and other locations in The Netherlands show that throughfall fluxes and atmospheric deposition estimates are reasonably in agreement for all components, except nitrate. There is still large uncertainty in canopy exchange processes of oxidised nitrogen and in deposition estimates of the different gases contributing to the total oxidised nitrogen flux. The contribution of aerosol deposition to the <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> in The Netherlands is 7 % for SO 4 2 -, 11 % for NH 4 + and 9 % for NO 3 -; for deciduous forests these numbers are 14, 15 and 17 %, and for coniferous forests 10, 17 and 20 % respectively.

They also found that the most active inhibitors on depressing the WAT were more likely to be more effective for decreasing <b>total</b> wax <b>deposition.</b> Moreover, the addition of the corrosion inhibitor (oleic imidazoline) significantly increased the efficacy of deposition inhibition.|$|R
