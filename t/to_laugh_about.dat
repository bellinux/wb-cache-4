The series uses 1980s musicin particular, Argentine rockand several Argentine musicians made cameo appearances. Graduados {{was part of a}} trend in 2012 Argentine television toward nostalgia. According to Argentine consumer-trends consultant Ximena Díaz Alarcón, [...] "The 80s are nowadays far enough to be idealized and close enough <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> the earlier versions of oneself". Psychologist and consumer-trends consultant Mariela Mociulsky also suggested that the show's structure invited viewers to compare their lives with the plans they made when they were younger.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

60|$|I {{sat there}} for another hour or more, {{finishing}} my books and payments and getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and put everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went upstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it.

60|$|Guy Pollock {{wrote to}} a cousin, a {{temporary}} army captain, a confiding and buoyant lad who took Carol to tea-dances, and laughed, as she had always wanted some one <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>about</b> nothing in particular. The captain introduced her {{to the secretary of}} a congressman, a cynical young widow with many acquaintances in the navy. Through her Carol met commanders and majors, newspapermen, chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the bureaus, and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage headquarters. The teacher took her to headquarters. Carol never became a prominent suffragist. Indeed her only recognized position was as an able addresser of envelopes. But she was casually adopted by this family of friendly women who, when they were not being mobbed or arrested, took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the Chesapeake Canal or talked about the politics of the American Federation of Labor.|$|E
60|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the burglarious enterprises in our midst, we had not felt the need of much protection in this direction; sometimes poultry was stolen, but this was a rare occurrence, and, although windows and doors were generally fastened for the night, this labour was often considered much more troublesome than necessary. But now a great change had taken place in the feelings of our community. When the first robbery occurred the neighbours were inclined <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> it, and to say that Captain Hubbard's habit of sitting up after the rest of his family had gone to bed and then retiring and forgetting to close the front door had invited the entrance of a passing tramp. But when a second and a third house, where windows and doors had not been left open, had been entered, and, in a measure, despoiled, people ceased to laugh; and if there had been any merriment at all on the subject, it would have been caused by the extraordinary and remarkable precautions taken against the entrance of thieves by night. The loaded pistol became the favourite companion of the head of the house; those who had no watch-dogs bought them; there were new locks, new bolts, new fastenings. At one time there was a mounted patrol of young men, which, however, was soon broken up by their mothers. But this trouble was unavailing, for at intervals the burglaries continued.|$|E
6000|$|At 6 A.M. on Friday, March 28, {{the boat}} was safely carried over the bar of Shark River, and we found {{ourselves}} once more hugging the shore southwards. The day was exceptional for West Africa, and much like damp weather {{at the end of}} an English May; the grey air at times indulged us with a slow drizzle. After two hours we passed another maritime village, where the farce of yesterday evening was re-acted, but this time with more vigour. Ignorant of my morning's private work, Hotaloya swore that it was Sánga- Tánga. I complimented him upon his proficiency in lying, and poor Lángobúmo, almost in tears, confessed that he had pointed out to me the real place. Whereupon Hotaloya began pathetically to reproach him for being thus prodigal of the truth. Núrya, the [...] "head trader," [...] coming down to the beach, with dignity and in force told me in English that I must land, and was chaffed accordingly. He then blustered and threatened instant death, at which it was easy <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> <b>About</b> 10 A.M. we lay off our destination, some ten miles south of Dyánye Point. It was a beautiful site, the end of a grassy dune, declining gradually toward the tree-fringed sea; the yellow slopes, cut by avenues and broken by dwarf table-lands, were long afterwards recalled to my memory, when sighting the fair but desolate scenery south of Paraguayan Asuncion. These downs appear to be a sea-coast raised by secular upheaval, and much older than the flat tracts which encroach upon the Atlantic. We could now understand the position of the town which figures so largely in the squadron-annals of the equatorial shore; it was set upon a hillock, whence the eye could catch the approaching sail of the slaver, and where the flag could be raised conspicuously in token of no cruiser being near.|$|E

6000|$|In {{that dark}} passage outside he felt two arms go tenderly round his neck; {{and a soft}} shape strain itself to his heart. [...] "I know you have been <b>laughing</b> <b>about</b> me. But you may. I'm yours now, even <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> at, if you want." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{arrived on}} time, {{and we began}} the game--with a large and eager free-list to superintend it. These superintendents were outside, with their noses pressed against the window-pane. The bankers {{described}} the game to me. So far as I recollect, the pattern of it was this: they had a pile of Mexican dollars on the table; twelve of them were of even date, fifty of them were of odd dates. The bankers were to separate a coin from the pile and hide it under a hand, and I must guess [...] "odd" [...] or [...] "even." [...] If I guessed correctly, the coin would be mine; if incorrectly, I lost a dollar. The first guess I made was [...] "even," [...] and was right. I guessed again, [...] "even," [...] and took the money. They fed me another one and I guessed [...] "even" [...] again, and took the money. I guessed [...] "even" [...] the fourth time, and took the money. It {{seemed to me that}} [...] "even" [...] was a good guess, and I might as well stay by it, which I did. I guessed [...] "even" [...] twelve times, and took the twelve dollars. I was doing as they secretly desired. Their experience of human nature had convinced them that any human being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be, would repeat his first guess if it won, and would go on repeating it if it should continue to win. It was their belief that an innocent would be almost sure at the beginning to guess [...] "even," [...] and not [...] "odd," [...] and that if an innocent should guess [...] "even" [...] twelve times in succession and win every time, he would go on guessing [...] "even" [...] to the end--so it was their purpose to let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates, one by one, until I should lose fifty dollars, and furnish those superintendents something <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> for a week to come.|$|E
