5|$|On {{a budget}} of $125 million, the {{shooting}} of Fast Five was scheduled for July and August 2010. Shooting had started by July 14, 2010, but it <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than forecast: the film was still being shot in early November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Quique was {{recorded}} in July 1993. During {{their time in the}} studio, Seefeel also recorded the EP More Like Space. Clifford felt that the tracks on More Like Space were simpler to create while those on Quique were more involved and <b>took</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{basic problem}} with this is that natural {{selection}} calls for the slow accumulation of changes, where a new phyla would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than a new class which would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than a new order, which would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than a new family, which would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than a new genus would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than {{emergence of a new}} species [...] but the apparent occurrence of high-level taxa without precedents is perhaps implying unusual evolutionary mechanisms.|$|R

Despite playing only thirteen games for the Broncos in 2007, he received the Broncos award for Best Back.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov I-6 was a Soviet biplane fighter {{prototype}} of the late 1920s. It was designed with traditional wooden construction {{in comparison with the}} wood and steel tube construction Polikarpov I-5. Its development <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than planned and the lead designer, Nikolai Polikarpov, was arrested for industrial sabotage, which only further delayed the project. Only two prototypes were built, as the I-5 was selected for production.|$|E
5|$|The United States Exploring Expedition led by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes was {{tasked with}} a vast survey of the Pacific Ocean {{starting}} in 1838. In September 1840 they arrived in Honolulu, where repairs to the ships <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than expected. Wilkes decided to spend the winter in Hawaii and {{take the opportunity to}} explore its volcanoes while waiting for better weather to continue the expedition. King Kamehameha III assigned American medical missionary Dr. Gerrit P. Judd to the expedition as a translator.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out <b>took</b> <b>longer.</b> The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E

5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than expected.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{debris and}} waste being carried into {{waterways}} by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing {{for four days}} from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel {{to the mouth of}} the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2–3days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to be cleared from debris.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies-Dramatiques. The operetta, La fauvette du temple, first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, {{and he was able}} to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, Les deux pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police authorities, and the production was temporarily shelved.|$|E

5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march {{around the}} Union left flank, had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's supply line, and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> than {{expected}} for Hardee {{to get his}} men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank, and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met this other force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who had ridden to the front to observe the battle, {{was shot and killed}} by Confederate infantry.|$|E

5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
5|$|Study of {{the decree}} was {{already under way}} when the first full {{translation}} of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three {{versions of the same}} text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to produce than planned.|$|E
