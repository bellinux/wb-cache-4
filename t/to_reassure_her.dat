5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her,</b> and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, Preminger {{announced}} Dandridge {{had been}} cast as Carmen. Initially {{thrilled by the}} prospect of playing one of the best film roles ever offered an African American female, Dandridge quickly began to doubt her ability to do it justice. After several days, she told her agent to advise Preminger she was backing out of the project. The director drove to her apartment <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> and assuage her fears, and the two unexpectedly began a passionate affair.|$|E
25|$|In {{the series}} Astonishing X-Men, a {{flashback}} shows that Frost's {{survival of the}} destruction of Genosha was due to Cassandra Nova creating Frost's secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent. A guilt ridden Frost creates psychic manifestations of a new Hellfire Club and proceeds to take down the X-Men one by one by showing them their deepest fears. Later on it is revealed that Frost's survivor's guilt is being exacerbated by Cassandra Nova who had placed a glimmer of her mind in Frost's before being trapped in the body of Stuff, and that Nova had even tricked Frost into thinking that she had been complicit in the destruction of Genosha. Kitty with aid from Cyclops, Blindfold, Hisako Ichiki, and Frost herself eventually prevent Nova from transferring her mind into Hisako. Everyone present is then suddenly teleported onto a S.W.O.R.D. ship headed towards the Breakworld.

Frost keeps in telepathic contact with Kitty, trying <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her,</b> even offering to psionically sedate her. Kitty sacrifices herself, phasing the bullet through Earth. In the aftermath, the X-Men are uncertain of Kitty's fate, believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the runaway bullet. Frost is devastated.|$|E
6000|$|And {{now she was}} {{no doubt}} anxious to know {{something}} of future plans she had probably not heard what had been decided {{with regard to the}} expedition, and perhaps fretted as to how her own actions had been interpreted by her father and the King. It was with a view <b>to</b> <b>reassuring</b> <b>her</b> on all these points that he now added: ...|$|R
6000|$|Our {{friends in}} Chicago smiled when I told them {{where we had}} been. Lorado said, [...] "A Honeymoon {{in the heart of}} the Rockies is just like you"--but I cared nothing for his gibes so long as Zulime was content, and I had but to over-hear her account of <b>her</b> trip <b>to</b> be <b>reassured.</b> <b>To</b> <b>her</b> it had been a noble {{exploration}} into a marvelous country.|$|R

500|$|While Koiwai works, Yotsuba plays {{house with}} her wooden blocks, then talks her father into a game of hide and seek and playing on the swings in the park. Inspired by a picture book, Yotsuba learns how to cook pancakes from her father, with {{assistance}} from Yanda. That evening, the Koiwais show Jumbo photographs from the hot air balloon festival. While her father finishes an assignment, Jumbo babysits Yotsuba and gives her a book about animals. The next day, Jumbo takes the Koiwais shopping for a digital camera. While the adults compare cameras, Yotsuba explores the electronics store with Fuka. When Yotsuba lies about breaking some dishes, Koiwai takes her to a guardian Ni≈ç statue at a Buddhist temple to scare the [...] "lying bug" [...] out of her. When Yotsuba and Ena visit Miura's apartment, Yotsuba is upset when she sees her empty cardboard robot costume. <b>To</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> that the robot is not dead, Miura puts the costume on and plays {{with her in the}} park.|$|E
500|$|Alison {{considers}} {{the connection between}} her coming out and her father's death. Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has lived, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way he thinks it should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled and lived in Europe, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all {{be placed in a}} small circle in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania ("Maps"). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches The Partridge Family, but Bruce switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out {{that he is going to}} see a psychiatrist because he is [...] "bad" [...] and not good like her. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the actual reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen tells Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her.</b> Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television ("Raincoat of Love").|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E

50|$|Paragon, {{believing that}} Magneto had created her, {{asked him what}} he had done <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Magneto <b>reassured</b> <b>her</b> he was not to blame for her suffering. Paragon asked who she was, Magneto {{replying}} by saying that she already knew that.|$|R
60|$|This was surprising, for Joan {{had been}} sure that Bannack {{lay in the}} {{opposite}} direction. Certainly this fact was not <b>reassuring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Perhaps the road turned soon.|$|R
2500|$|Giarritano tried <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} did not have to use {{narcotics}} in order to succeed in the music business.

2500|$|On December 17, Prime Minister Harper {{suggested}} that the attacker {{may not have been}} acting alone, but did not elaborate. In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. [...] "All you hear is a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path." [...] After the incident, Harper's first call was to his mother <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Lantos, {{who was on}} the House Committee on International Affairs, took Colette Avital, a Labor Party {{member of}} the Israeli Knesset, by the hand and, {{according}} to Haaretz, tried <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> with these words: [...] "My dear Colette, don't worry. You won't have any problem with Saddam. We'll be rid of the bastard soon enough. And in his place we'll install a pro-Western dictator, who will be good for us and for you." [...] He later denied saying this, but Avital confirmed it, according to Ben Terrall, an adviser to Maad H. Abu-Ghazalah, a Libertarian Party candidate who ran against Lantos that year.|$|E
5000|$|Fitz {{suggests}} using Audrey to lure Daniels into a trap, and Coulson reluctantly agrees, as does Audrey. Rehearsing in a music hall, Audrey {{is again}} accosted by Daniels, before Fitz, Simmons and Triplett attack him with advanced pure light weapons, hoping {{they will be}} enough to kill Daniels. He overpowers them and approaches Audrey, but Coulson, obscured from Audrey's view, attacks Daniels with another light weapon, as does Triplett, causing Daniels to explode. The blast knocks Audrey unconscious, and Coulson tends <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>reassuring</b> <b>her</b> that he is still alive, before she wakes up to find him gone.|$|R
60|$|Her head sunk on her bosom; her {{delicate}} lips trembled a little; {{she said no}} more. The way <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> and console <b>her</b> lay plainly enough before me, if I chose to take it. Without stopping to think, I took it.|$|R
50|$|When the Marquise awakes {{from her}} slumber she very much wants {{to thank the}} Count for having saved her, but the troops have already left so she is not able <b>to.</b> <b>Her</b> father <b>reassures</b> <b>her</b> that she will {{have the chance to}} thank him at a later date.|$|R
2500|$|These lackluster {{ratings were}} {{highlighted}} with Henry making {{jokes about the}} topic. For example, when talking to an up-and-coming author in her first TV interview in an effort <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> he said [...] "Just imagine nobody is watching, it's perilously close to that anyway", and also when interviewing guests, occasionally thanking them for sharing their thoughts with the [...] "millions of people who watch this show", much to the amused response of his co-hosts. ABC1 program Q also poked fun at Breakfast's lack of viewers. As the panel was discussing how 1700 migrant workers {{had been allowed to}} work at Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill mining project, a tweet appeared {{on the bottom of the}} screen: [...] "You know who could use 1700 people, Channel ten Breakfast".|$|E
2500|$|During a Children's Hospital visit near Christmas 1971 a boy {{playing with}} a toy pistol frightened Genie, and when Curtiss tried <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>her</b> Genie said an {{abbreviated}} version of Curtiss' words, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] About two weeks later Curtiss heard Genie speaking to herself and using an invented gesture for the word [...] "naughty", and when Curtiss asked Genie what she said she repeated, [...] "Little bad boy. Bad gun." [...] out loud for several minutes, marking {{the first time she}} spoke about something in the past. Several months later David and Marilyn overheard her saying, [...] "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." [...] to herself, marking the first time anyone heard her talk about her life before starting to acquire language. She infrequently spoke to others about her early life, but the Riglers said that {{for the rest of the}} time she lived with them she constantly repeated [...] "Father hit" [...] to herself. By the end of her stay, she could also talk about something someone else had told her.|$|E

Confused and distraught, Rosemary calls Hal a [...] "psycho" [...] over the phone and effectively breaks up with him.|$|R

Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes' family eats the food made for the party.|$|R

50|$|The Rainhill murders {{had gone}} undetected for eight months. It appears Deemings {{brothers}} and Maries sister had {{been led to}} believe that Marie and the children were in Brighton on a holiday, and then assumed they were overseas again. Deeming had made several visits <b>to</b> Birkenhead <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Martha <b>her</b> sister and the children were well. Detection of the murders was also obstructed by Deemings lease (as Williams) on Dinham Villa, which stipulated that the house should not be sold or relet for six months, because of the imminent arrival of Colonel Brookes and/or Williams sister. The lease also allowed Williams to reconcrete the floor.|$|R
60|$|Ethel used {{to watch}} them, and think how {{beautiful}} their countenances were, and talk them over with her father, who was quite happy about them now. She gave assistance, which Alan never once called unhandy, to all his contrivances, and often floundered in upon his conferences with Margaret, {{in a way that}} would have been very provoking, if she had not always blushed and looked so excessively discomfited, and they had only <b>to</b> laugh and <b>reassure</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

Joseph <b>reassures</b> <b>her</b> that she can handle whatever is thrown at her. She's strong and beautiful, a born actress who can now prove it.
