5|$|In desperation, Mary {{decides to}} tell the truth to Gopalam and Ammi. To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story that Mary is possessed by <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary receive their salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E
5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals. During these rituals, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dying or deceased individual is given safe passage {{into the next}} life. This ritual {{is directly related to}} the economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person {{of the next generation}} dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E

5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was the victim of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
25|$|In later life, Ali {{developed}} {{an interest in}} Sufism, which he referenced in his autobiography, <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Butterfly.

According to Ali's daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali, who co-authored <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Butterfly with him, Ali was attracted to Sufism after reading the books of Inayat Khan, which contain Sufi teachings.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{deceased}} person {{is made up of}} yin and yang components called hun and po (魂 and 魄). The yin component, po, is associated with the grave, and the yang component, hun, is associated with ancestral tablets . At death the components split into three different souls; the po stays with the body to the grave, another goes to judgment, and the hun resides in an ancestral tablet. The po and hun are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants. Eventually both the po and hun go to the underworld, although the hun goes to heaven first. Unlike in western usages of the term, underworld has no negative connotation.|$|E
25|$|In chapter five Cuthbert, {{while still}} a youth tending to sheep in Lauderdale, has {{a vision of}} a bishop being borne to heaven; {{subsequently}} it is discovered that Aidan, bishop of Lindisfarne, had died on the same hour as Cuthbert's vision. Far to the south, a young Cuthbert is travelling during the winter and crosses the river Wear at Chester-le-Street, taking shelter in one of the empty summer dwellings; suffering from lack of food, his horse pulls down warm bread and meat from the roof of the dwelling (chapter six). Book i ends with the anonymous author making mention of several other miracles of Cuthbert's youth without going into detail: how God provided food for him in camp with his army against an enemy, how he saw <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reeve taken up to the sky, his defeat of some demons, and his cure of the insane (chapter seven).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{accepted}} by all Wiccans, {{a belief in}} reincarnation is the dominant afterlife belief within Wicca, having been originally espoused by Gardner. Understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners; the prominent Wiccan Raymond Buckland for instance insisted that the souls of humans would only ever incarnate into human bodies, whereas other Wiccans believe that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human can incarnate into any other life form. There is also a common Wiccan belief that any Witches will come to be reincarnated as future Witches, an idea originally expressed by Gardner. Gardner also articulated {{the view that the}} human soul rested for a period between bodily death and its incarnation, with this resting place commonly being referred to as The Summerland among the Wiccan community. This allows many Wiccans to believe that mediums are able to contact the spirits of the deceased, a belief that it adopted from Spiritualism.|$|E

25|$|One {{year after}} being dragged to Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth without Castiel, {{carrying}} inside his body <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vampire named Benny. The two brothers begin a fight against Crowley {{to find the}} Demon Tablet and lock the Gates of Hell, thereby trapping all demons in Hell. All the while fighting Metatron, the scribe of God, who they think is on their side but is really trying to become the new God himself. The brothers use Kevin Tran to help them read the tablet and accomplish their goal. Castiel is brought back by an angel named Naomi and takes possession of the Angel Tablet. After realizing that to lock the Gates of Hell Sam must die, Dean ends the trials. Castiel, however, is stripped of his grace by an angel named Metatron who proceeds to have millions of angels locked out of Heaven. The season ends with millions of angels falling from the sky.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E

500|$|As Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, Williams {{became known}} for his efforts to reorient the study of moral {{philosophy}} to psychology, history, and in particular to the Greeks.

500|$|Though not {{explicitly}} stated, it is {{implied that the}} horse is really Berlifitzing. The first paragraph of the story references metempsychosis, the belief that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person is transferred to another living being upon death. Other evidence is the tapestry, {{the lack of a}} history or recognition in the horse and, certainly, the prophecy referencing the immortality of the Berlifitzings. The story can be read as an allegory, a warning that a human soul can be overtaken by the evil it has created, though Poe himself does not suggest such a moral. Such evil can be created by a person's hatred and pride.|$|E
