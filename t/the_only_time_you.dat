Josef II cancelled it and so in 1787 the Windischgrätzs bought it and rebuilt it as a castle. The castle, which was finished in 1700 went down, and nowadays we can see only some remain of the walls and a small tower. The last one is a riding hall from the time of romanticism, which was built in 1830. It is the second largest riding hall in Central Europe, right after the Viennese riding hall.

50|$|The third {{category}} of determiners shows a relation between speaker and noun {{where it is}} not about distance but instead line of sight, these determiners being used when the noun is out of sight regardless of distance. The three determiners belonging to this category are “doo”, “dosh” and “ʔoo”. Again as in the other two determiner categories there is a distinction between when used as an independent pronoun or a determiner. For “doo” and “dosh” the independent pronoun form is “doʔo” and “doʔsh”, but for “ʔoo” {{this is not the case}} as it is an exception among all the determiners that is not used a pronoun. Besides it not being used as a pronoun, “ʔoo” also has the special characteristic of only being used with animate objects, mainly human, as Sprott says “it can sometimes be applied to non-human animates, but with a great deal of hesitation and some reluctance”. Another restriction that is pointed out by a speaker mentioned as one of Sprott’s Jemez teachers is that they feel that the pronoun would not be used when mentioning the person for <b>the</b> first <b>time,</b> <b>only</b> after <b>you</b> have already mentioned them could you use it.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{only five}} weeks, I think, since our scheme was launched, and I am bound {{to say that}} at the end of those five weeks the {{position}} may fairly be described as hopeful and promising. I do not think that the millennium will come in five more weeks, nor in fifty weeks; but I do say that for a scheme of so wide a scope to be received as this scheme has been received, is a highly encouraging sign. It does not follow that because we have launched our ship with a slant of fair wind, this means the same thing as getting into harbour. There are plenty of difficult points that we have got to settle. But when I try from my conning-tower in this office, to read the signs in the political skies, I am full of confidence. The great thing is that in every party both in India and at home--in every party, and every section, and every group--there is a recognition of the magnitude and the gravity of the enterprise on which we have embarked. I studied very closely the proceedings at Madras, and the proceedings at Amritsar, and in able speeches made in both those places I find a truly political spirit in the right sense of the word--in the sense of perspective and proportion--which I sometimes wish could be imitated by some of my political friends nearer home. I mean that issues, important enough but upon which there is some difference, are put aside--for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>only,</b> if <b>you</b> like, but still put aside--in face of the magnitude of the issues that we present to you in these reforms. On Monday, in The Times newspaper, there was a long and most interesting communication from Bombay, written, I believe, by a gentleman of very wide Indian knowledge and level-headed humour. What does he say? He takes account of the general position as he found it in India shortly after my Despatch arrived. [...] "I might have dwelt," [...] he says, [...] "upon the fact that I have not met a single official who does not admit that some changes which should gratify Indian longings were necessary, and I might have expatiated upon the abounding evidence that Lord Morley's despatch and speech have unquestionably eased a tension which had become exceedingly alarming."

Both surgeons, the characters competed {{with each other}} professionally and failed to be adequately supportive {{of each other in}} their personal crises, so Corday ends the relationship in Season 5. According to an article published in Jet in 1999, Eriq La Salle was the reason why the romance dissolved. He was unhappy that Benton's interracial romance with Corday was being shown as less problematic than his prior romances with black characters, such as Jeanie Boulet (played by Gloria Reuben) and Carla Reese (played by Lisa Nicole Carson). In an interview La Salle stated, [...] "As an African-American man, it becomes a bit offensive if the negative things are all you're showing. Because in real life we romance and get on each other's nerves and laugh and do all the things that any other race of people do. So if <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> show a balanced relationship is in an interracial relationship, whether it's conscious or sub-conscious, it sends a message I'm not comfortable with." [...] Mindful of the image that he was portraying on television, La Salle asked producers to end Benton's interracial romance. While being interviewed by Johnnie Cochran on Johnnie Cochran Tonight, La Salle commented, [...] "We {{have to take care of}} the message that we're sending as African-Americans or any other group of minorities, that we have the exact same type of exchanges with our mates that we get to see our White counterparts have."

5000|$|In {{most cases}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see {{homosexuality}} in hip-hop {{is when you}} see {{it in a way that}} provokes lust in heterosexual male viewers. A lot of the sexism that takes place in hip-hop music has to do with the lack of feminist artist. There are several hip-hop artists that refuse to break the norms of society. If there were more artists that advocated for the LGBT community, then there would be more music that reflects the ideas of homosexuality, but not only for male viewers. There have been small cases where hip-hop artist break the barrier of [...] "normality" [...] and defy masculinity. For example, hip-hop artist, Frank Ocean, admits to being bisexual, which surprised many fans. Although this does not help the lack of feminism in hip-hop, it is one step to breaking the norms of sexuality. It allows viewers to see a difference in hip- hop. According to an article by Sheng Kuan Chung, hip hop's music videos reach viewers all across the world. People in varying ages are influenced by these hip-hop artists in many ways. Because of this, their ideas on sexuality and feminism are altered. There have not been many feminist artists that advocate for women or sexuality however there are some. According to VH1 a few of these feminist hip-hop artist are Lauryn Hill with her song [...] "Doo Wop, (That Thing)", Queen Latifah with her song [...] "U.N.I.T.Y", and Salt-N-Pepa with their song [...] "None of Your Business". Not all these artist address homosexuality in their music, however they do advocate for the empowerment of women. Their songs inspire young girls all across the world. If there were more artists like them, then the problem with sexuality and feminism in hip-hop music could be fixed. Several female artists today have surfaced with trying to fix the problem in hip-hop.|$|E

This is a particularly trying time for her - she has to adjust to being at the bottom of the heap after enjoying so long at the top, and on top of that she is supervised initially by Dale Edson - described even by Romano as a weasel. During this time, she makes repeated attempts to become romantically involved with Benton, eventually succeeding. He even agrees to take over as her supervisor after a while. She faces further trouble when, at the end of a 36-hour shift, she makes a non-lethal mistake in calculating how much drug to inject into a patient. Fortunately, this doesn't put her off her stride, and she uses it to campaign for better conditions for junior medical staff. She also amicably ends her romantic relationship with Peter after that (while Eriq La Salle requested the relationship be written out saying: [...] "As an African-American man, it becomes a bit offensive if the negative things are all you're showing. Because in real life we romance and get on each other's nerves and laugh and do all the things that any other race of people do. So if <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> show a balanced relationship is in an interracial relationship, whether it's conscious or sub-conscious, it sends a message I'm not comfortable with." [...] Alex did not find issues with it, citing as follows: [...] "You see interracial relationships all over the place America. I kind of naively thought it would be even more liberal in America. And it couldn't have been further from the truth. In fact, I'm trying to think if there's a television show right now 2013 where there's an African American and Caucasian relationship. They're few and far between."). However, the affair ends up haunting her later on when Dr. Maggie Doyle correctly accuses Dr. Romano of sexual harassment after he finds out she was gay and gives her a bad performance review; Elizabeth wants to go on the record to support Maggie's claims, but is forced to back down when Romano reveals he'd known she was dating Peter secretly while he was her supervisor.|$|E
