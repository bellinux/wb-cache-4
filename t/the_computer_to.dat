5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> play against human players.|$|E

5|$|The opening credits of {{the film}} were {{produced}} by the CG director, Seichi Tanaka.

5|$|The battle system {{takes place}} on a 3D {{battlefield}} in real-time, instead of the turn-based system of the campaign. Battles {{are similar to those}} in , where two armies from opposing factions engage in combat until one side is defeated or withdraws. Warfare in Medieval: Total War occurs when the player or the artificial intelligence moves their armies into a province held by a hostile faction. The player is then presented with the option of fighting the battle on the battle map, or allowing <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> automatically resolve it. Alongside the campaign battles, players have the option of both historical and custom battles, where the player controls what climate, units and terrain will be present on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E

5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona {{was used as the}} model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E
