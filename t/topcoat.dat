5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long <b>topcoat</b> which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} painted with red lead primer and a lead-based <b>topcoat,</b> which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats. Since 1990, acrylic topcoats {{have been used}} instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 {{and it is now}} maintained by 38 painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed {{in the pocket}} of his <b>topcoat.</b> Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E
50|$|They are {{sometimes}} confused with or {{referred to as}} <b>topcoats,</b> which are shorter and end {{at or above the}} knees. <b>Topcoats</b> and overcoats together are known as outercoats. Unlike overcoats, <b>topcoats</b> are usually made from lighter weight cloth such as gabardine or covert, while overcoats are made from heavier cloth or fur.|$|R

5000|$|Acrylic <b>topcoating</b> is {{the most}} {{economical}} and widely available <b>topcoating</b> used. Its spray-on application provides a glossy finish and a resistance to UV degradation. Because the coating is thin, the material is both easy to fabricate and is reparable by high frequency or hot air welding. Depending on environmental conditions, an acrylic <b>topcoating</b> will give the fabric a life span of 10 years or more. Acrylic <b>topcoats</b> are ideal for fabric structures, {{and can be found}} on products used as tradeshow pavilions, temporary concert halls, and portable warehouses.|$|R
25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The <b>topcoat</b> is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|E
500|$|The head is {{somewhat}} large {{in proportion to}} the body, with small ears, and has a unique feature called a [...] "toad eye" [...] caused by extra fleshiness of the eyelids, which helps to deflect water and provide extra insulation. As with most cold-weather pony breeds, the Exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly underlayer and a <b>topcoat</b> of longer, oily hairs that prevent the undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water down the sides of the animal to fall from just a few drip areas. The mane and tail are thick and long, and the dock of the tail is of a type common in cold-weather ponies, having coarse hairs, called a [...] "frost cap," [...] "snow chute," [...] or [...] "ice tail" [...] that deflects rainwater away from the groin and underbelly areas to fall from the long hairs {{on the back of the}} hind legs.|$|E

50|$|Most fabrics {{used for}} fabric {{structures}} {{have some form}} of <b>topcoating</b> applied to the exterior or coating to make cleaning easier. <b>Topcoating</b> provides a hard surface {{on the outside of the}} material, forming a barrier that aids in preventing dirt from sticking to the material, while allowing the fabric to be cleaned with water. As the material ages, the <b>topcoating</b> will eventually erode, exposing the fabric to dirt and making it more difficult to clean. The thicker the <b>topcoating,</b> the longer it will last. However, coatings that are too thick will embrittle and crack when folded.|$|R

[...] "Reactive Layer Coating" [...] can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. [...] "Multicote" [...] is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin <b>topcoat.</b>|$|E

40|$|Axial {{suspension}} {{plasma spraying}} (ASPS) is a new, innovative plasma spray technique using a feedstock consisting of fine powder particles suspended in a liquid. With ASPS, {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC) <b>topcoats</b> with columnar structures have been produced that are built up by fine powder particles. The microstructure consists of micro-,meso-, and macro-pores. Due to thewide pore size range including nano-porosity {{it is challenging to}} measure porosity and pore size distribution in TBC <b>topcoats.</b> However, it is important to characterize the porous structure as it affects the thermal conductivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) cryoporometry is a promising method for performing such measurements because of its capability of measuring pores down to nanometer size and providing information about the pore geometry. The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce NMR cryoporometry as a newcharacterization technique for determining porosity, pore size distribution and pore geometry of TBC <b>topcoats</b> produced by ASPS. The study includes the comparison of two different yttria-stabilized zirconia <b>topcoats</b> and NMR cryoporometry is complemented by microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

2500|$|The Airedale has a medium-length {{black and}} tan coat with a harsh <b>topcoat</b> {{and a soft}} undercoat. They are an alert and {{energetic}} breed, [...] "not aggressive but fearless." [...] It has been claimed that the larger [...] "Oorang" [...] type Airedales are more eager than the smaller, breed standard Airedales, {{but this is not}} necessarily so. The large type have been used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC (American Kennel Club) conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to hip dysplasia than the standard Airedales.|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce {{products}} implement automated flatline finish systems. [...] These systems {{consist of}} a series of processing stations that may include sanding, dust removal, staining, sealer and <b>topcoat</b> applications. As the name suggests, the primary part shapes are flat. Liquid wood finishes are applied via automated spray guns in an enclosed environment or spray cabin. The material then can enter an oven or be sanded again depending on the manufacturer’s setup. The material can also be recycled through the line to apply another coat of finish or continue in a system that adds successive coats depending on the layout of the production line. The systems typically used one of two approaches to production.|$|E

40|$|Raman and {{infrared}} spectroscopy are two complementary spectroscopic techniques {{that can produce}} fast, effi-cient and accurate detection of the pigments and/or binders used in automotive <b>topcoats.</b> Micro-Raman spectroscopy, due to its non-destructiveness, has been extensively used for identification of pigments and dyes in forensic investiga-tion of hit-and-run accidents. This technique provides very useful and significant information from very small sam-ples of evidence without any previous preparation of the sample. The recorded Raman spectra of the un-known/suspected samples can be compared with a spectrum of the referent sample, which can coincide with the one already existing in the Raman database of pigments. In order to form our own spectral database of automotive paints for forensic investigations in hit-and-run of-fences in Republic of Macedonia, an investigation of automotive <b>topcoats</b> of different origins was carried out. In our previous study, pigments in some automotive <b>topcoats,</b> produced by Mobihel, have been identified using micro-Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. In the present study, we report micro-Raman and FT-IR spectra of ten base coat automotive <b>topcoats,</b> {{as well as some}} of their mixtures, produced by Glasürit. In order to demonstrate the availability and/or the advantages of the micro-Raman spectroscopic technique in forensic investigation in road accidents, four successfully solved cases from the police investigation in hit-and-run accidents are presented in this work...|$|R

2500|$|Outerwear: [...] Black-tie events do {{not involve}} {{outerwear}} and coats and gloves are no longer {{considered part of the}} dress code. [...] However, etiquette for what to wear in public in transit to and from black tie occasions was stiffer in earlier eras and remain an option: [...] Matching overcoats are usually black, charcoal, or dark blue, and traditionally of the Chesterfield style. A guards coat was also once popular, and a lighter <b>topcoat</b> can be worn in summer. Historically, an Inverness coat was also worn. Until the mid-20th century, gloves and scarves were always worn, and are still occasionally seen in gray leather and white silk, respectively. [...] White kid gloves have never been standard with black tie, remaining exclusive to white tie dress.|$|E
2500|$|A fourth model, the Bond Ranger {{light van}} was {{introduced}} in March 1960. This utilised the body with the cut out behind the front seats from the Family Saloon and married it with a similar hardtop roof without side windows, but {{with the addition of}} an opening flap around the rear window. Very much an economy model, in standard form it came finished in primer with <b>topcoat</b> as an optional extra. A total of 39 cars of this type were recorded in factory production records as a Van rather than a Ranger. This is believed to denote that they were only fitted with a single driver's front seat to increase load capacity, much like the 1952 Minitruck. U.K. law at the time also meant that this type of lightweight, single-seat three-wheeler could be driven [...] unaccompanied on learner L-plates without the need to pass a driving test.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she {{came up to me and}} said, 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off – I just put on my <b>topcoat</b> and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And I went home and went back to bed".|$|E

5000|$|PVD {{coatings}} {{are sometimes}} harder and more corrosion resistant than coatings applied by the electroplating process.

2500|$|Shelties have {{a double}} coat, and often shed {{a lot of the}} time, no matter the season. The <b>topcoat</b> {{consists}} of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry, and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm. Mats can be commonly found behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the [...] "skirts"), as well as around the collar (if worn). The coat is usually shed twice a year, often at spring and autumn. Females will also shed right before or right after giving birth. Male shelties technically shed less than females but [...] fur still comes off constantly. Shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved, a condition known as alopecia. [...] Spaying or neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer, more prone to matting and even more profuse. It should be noted that Shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat, rather than individual hair. This makes them much easier to groom and clean-up after than many smooth-haired dogs, which leave loose fur in their space.|$|E
