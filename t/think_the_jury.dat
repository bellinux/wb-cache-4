50|$|Once {{deliberation}} {{begins the}} jurors {{are allowed to}} talk to each other. They are to remain together, except overnight, until they either reach a decision or determine they cannot reach a decision. In the later occurrence, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> is said to be deadlocked and is called a hung <b>jury.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> decides, this is called the verdict. They inform the judge and return to the courtroom where the verdict is read. The judge may either accept the verdict or overrule it. It is rare for the verdict to be overruled. This happens when <b>the</b> judge <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> verdict is unlawful. Often this is because <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> does not follow the legal instructions. It can also happen if <b>the</b> judge <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> interpreted <b>the</b> evidence in a manner that was not legal.

5000|$|Paulissen {{started his}} 2008 season by {{defending}} the men's cross-country race title at the Belgian Championships and by {{taking part in}} the Roc d'Azur MTB Marathon tournament, where he registered two more triumphs in the process. In July, Paulissen grabbed his first major success in men's marathon race at the UCI World Championships in Villabassa under a more controversial decision. With only 70 meters left to go, Paulissen held off a sprint duel match against Switzerland's Christoph Sauser for a spectacular finish, until they suddenly made contact with their handlebars and arms near the barrier and then both crashed. Being the first man up after hitting the tarmac hard, Paulissen reluctantly carried his broken bike towards the finish, while his rival Sauser remounted his lead to cross the line first, but ended his campaign with a protest. After the race, the UCI officials decided that Sauser was relegated to second place for riding [...] "dangerously" [...] in the sprint and instead Paulissen was declared the World champion with a time of 4:46:56. Following his controversial triumph, Paulissen admitted, [...] "I am very happy with this success. Unfortunately, this great race in the area where I live ended this way, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was right." ...|$|E

It's an injustice for the city of San Antonio, it allows young kids to breach contracts and violate authority without any consequences ... It sends the wrong message." [...] Pageant officials said it wasn't that Domonique Ramirez had gained weight that was at issue. Rather they claimed that Ramirez was [...] "unreliable, chronically showing up late or skipping events such as grocery store openings to go to paid appearances, and violated her contract in ways ranging from not writing thank-you notes to blowing off a physical fitness program and vocal lessons." [...] Woods also stated that [...] "She (Ramirez) was doing a photo shoot and asked to wear her wardrobe from the competition, but it did not fit her. I told her we need to get you on an exercise program. We need to get ready to compete for Miss Texas, just like any elite athlete." ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{interesting}} that some of my predictions came true and some did not, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{is still out on}} many of them. I start to remind everyone on the glorious past of Nephrology, from the physiology, translational and methodological discoveries that have contributed to the development of our discipline. I predict that the Academic branch of Nephrology will continue to excel in three domains: Creative Research,Teaching (Training) and Innovative Clinical Care. I forsee dramatic changes in Nephrology practice in the short term (10 years) and I discuss which areas will have a most dramatic impact. Many developments will likely curtail the growth of CKD and decrease the burden of ESRD on society. The greatest challenge will be to ensure that {{what can be done to}} alleviate suffering and premature death from kidney disease will be done, in a cost-effective manner, and that all patients with kidney disease have reasonable and timely access to care for their illnesses. Nephrologists practicing in the second quarter of the 21 st Century and beyond will be justifiably proud of their discipline, just as their predecessors have...|$|E

I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> slept in separate or adjoining rooms with a door open between them, as the record shows, violated the requirement that they be kept together during the trial.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 A judge {{holds an}} {{important}} position during a jury trial. In a context that is typically unfamiliar and unknown to jurors, the judge regularly holds the highest amount {{of respect and}} {{is thought to be}} the most just, fair, and wise professional in the courtroom. The judge speaks to <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> as well as about <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> and both give <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> cues and information used to attribute meanings to the actions and events occurring. In short, judge communication during a trial can be very impactful to a <b>jury</b> and <b>the</b> trial process as a whole. This study looked specifically at the communication of judges pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> itself, either to or about <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> and how this may correlate with specific judge characteristics, particularly sex and race. When speaking to <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> this study analyzed what instructions, explanations, informal, or praising communication they offered <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> When speaking about <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> this study analyzed what instruction, positive or negative characterizations, advocating, and informal statements they made regarding <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Additionally, this study examined two ceremonial acts a judge engaged in regarding a jury: allowing them to ask questions after witness testimony in a civil trial, or having the entire room stand when <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> entered or exited; both are unrequired and up to the discretion of the judge. This study found that female and racial minority judges were more likely to advocate for <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> to allow <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to ask questions of witnesses in civil trials, and to have the room stand for <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> when it entered or exited than did White, male judges...|$|R
