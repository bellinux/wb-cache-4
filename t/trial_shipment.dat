5000|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War in the 1950s, sales {{declined}} {{because of}} diminishing defense orders. United States Time Corporation President Lehmkuhl was convinced that an inexpensive watch that was both accurate and durable would be a marketing success. He felt that low cost could be accomplished through the combination of automation, precision tooling techniques used in making fuse timers, and a simpler design than that of higher-priced Swiss watches. Durability was accomplished through a new hard alloy, Armalloy, developed through wartime research. Armalloy was used to produce long wearing bearings, replacing the expensive jewels traditionally used in a watch's movement. These innovations led to the eventual public debut of the Timex brand in 1950, though the name was first used on a small <b>trial</b> <b>shipment</b> of nurses' watches in 1945.

The project is implemented through a grant to OECS and CARDI. Some marketing and post-harvest activities are carried. ut through a sub-contract with CATCO. The mid-term evaluation 9 / 89 - 2 / 92 was conducted by Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development. Documents were reviewed in Barbados RDO/C, visits were made to three OECS countries, and interviews were held with project clients. The purpose was to clarify concerns about the initial design, assess progress to date, and set recommendations for future priority activities and project focus. The major findings and conclusions are: " 	 Good {{progress has been made}} during the period 1991 to date. TROPRO is making an important contribution and has the potential to induce significant progress in the OECS agricultural diversification efforts. * 	 The TA component has made good progress considering the project has been fully operational for only about one year. Increased demand for post-harvest handling services require that there is a significant acceleration of this component. * 	 Integration of module activity has lagged. The production component needs to be more integrated with the commercial operations of the project, and linked with the <b>trial</b> <b>shipment</b> activities. The recently initiated Joint Regional Marketing Program (JRMP) has positioned the project so that integration of the project support services can be achieved. * 	 Priority should be given to hands-on, in-country technical assistance (TA) and training.

40|$|The Papua New Guinea {{government}} has stated {{its desire to}} increase income and reduce poverty through export-driven economic growth, including fresh produce. Assessments have been conducted {{for a number of}} fruits and vegetables of the risks of Papua New Guinea imports into New Zealand. A <b>trial</b> <b>shipment</b> of fresh ginger from Papua New Guinea passed the Biosecurity New Zealand inspection with ease and was considered to be of exportable quality, but no further shipments have occurred. In this paper the technical and financial viability of exporting fresh ginger from Papua New Guinea to New Zealand was assessed in terms of the following criteria: technical capability of meeting market requirements for consistency in quality and volume and dealing with quarantine and other market access issues; market opportunities for growth and sustainability; financial investments required and how they will be financed; and organisational/management capability of coordinating the ginger supply chain from farm to markets overseas. The conclusion was that exports of Papua New Guinea fresh ginger into the Page | 75 Fresh ginger exports from PNG to NZ Chang_Griffith_Maino New Zealand market would be both technically and financially infeasible. In contrast, the Papua New Guinea domestic market has considerable potential with the demand for ginger, as well as other fresh produce, set to increase substantially {{in the next few years}} due to the up-coming PNG LNG Project and other mining activities.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} research plan (2008 to 2010) included comprehensive {{studies on}} two commercial mango cultivars of Pakistan including Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa with overall objective of evaluating controlled atmosphere (CA) and modified atmosphere (MA) conditions for sea-freighting mangoes to distant markets. The targeted areas included: a) Benchmark studies {{to monitor and}} document sea freight supply chain from farm to market (Germany); b) Evaluating impact of controlled and modified atmosphere storage conditions; c) Comparing open top vs. closed top boxes for sea freighting mangoes; e) Testing new chemistry fungicides for postharvest disease management, especially Stem End Rot (SER) in mango cv. Sufaid Chaunsa during long term storage and f) effects of pre-cooling on mango cv. Sufaid Chaunsa. Moreover, effect of harvest maturity (mid and late season harvest) on fruit quality and shelf life of Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa was also evaluated. Benchmarking studies showed that mango export supply chain to Europe (Germany) using Maersk shipping line requires about 35 days (Farm to retailing). The results revealed that poor skin colour development, skin shriveling, firmness retention in cv. Sindhri while disease development, mainly SER, (caused by organism: Botryodiplodia theobromae and Phomopsis mangiferae) in both cultivars are main issues [...] The static research trials were conducted side by side {{to address these issues}} and to optimize the sea shipment protocols. Controlled atmosphere storage had significant impact on physico-chemical fruit quality and improved market value and consumer acceptability of the two cvs. Exposure to ILOS (Initial low oxygen stress) for one week had no significant negative effect; however, a concentration of 10 % CO 2 was found to be too high and inhibited the fruit ripening completely. These studies indicated that 1 - 1. 5 % O 2 and 4 - 5 % CO 2 as better CA combination for cv. Sindhri and Sufaid Chaunsa mangoes, for 4 weeks shipping period, followed by 5 - 7 days for post arrival handling, ripening and retailing. Mid-season harvested fruit of both cultivars showed better response in terms of better fruit marketability, less disease development and retention of the firmness of stored fruit under CA and MA conditions. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) trials showed that XÂ®-tend bagging can only suppress the disease development at ripening and can be used for sea shipping mangoes to short distance markets; however the fruit with skin bruises and damages must be avoided for bagging. The experiment on packing mangoes in different types of corrugated boxes concluded that open top boxes were better option for sea shipping of the two mango cvs. since fruit developed good colour in open top boxes. Moreover, cv. Sindhri showed better shipping potential with higher percentage of marketable fruit than cv. Sufaid Chaunsa, which is more prone to post harvest diseases during long term storage. Post-harvest disease study during long term storage in cv. Sufaid Chaunsa showed that the combined application of Thiabendazole @ 2000 ppm with Prochloraz @ 0. 5 ml/L (Tank mix; HWT- 52 Â°C; 5 min) had significant disease control (i. e. stem end rot, side rot and anthracnose). Concentrations of Thiabendazole alone (1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm) did not perform well in this regard. Postharvest application of new chemistry fungicides including Amistar (0. 8 ml/L) (A. I. Azoxystrobin), Nativo (0. 3 g/L) (A. I. Trifloxystrobin and Tebuconazole), Cabrio Top (3 g/L) (A. I. Pyraclostrobin and Metiram) and Scholar were also found to be effective against postharvest disease development in mango. Best control was achieved by Amistar against anthracnose and stem end rot. Moreover, immediate precooling after harvest and processing gave significantly improved disease control and less weight loss in cultivar Sufaid Chaunsa. Finally, during July 2012, an industry collaborated <b>trial</b> <b>shipment</b> of cv. Sindhri was made to a commercial importer in Netherlands in which learning outcomes of these studies were intergraded from harvest to maturity and to marketing.

40|$|Poor {{marketing}} and distribution frequently waste opportunities provided by increased or diversified agricultural production There are many examples where farmers have produced higher yields or cultivated new crops at their own expense and risk but have not benefited from any increased income. Instead, they may have suffered financial loss from investing in higher inputs or labour. It {{is not surprising that}} farmers become disappointed and revert to less onerous and risky production strategies to meet local needs only. This limits their income and stifles the development of a rural economy. It also deprives the country of much-needed food for the cities and of products to export for foreign exchange. Many, governments have now recognized the need for improved marketing, distribution and exports. One particularly successful example is the Dominica Export Import Agency (DEXIA), which was set up by the Government of Dominica in July 1986. In less than three years it has achieved some dramatic results. DEXIA is responsible for issuing licences for the import of basic food commodities such as rice and sugar. So it controls imports, allowing local production to satisfy the domestic market first. However, DEXIA's main objective is to encourage, help and provide facilities for the private sector in Dominica to increase exports of vegetables, fruit, flowers and handicrafts. There are 20 - 25 commodities currently exported and DEXIA has prayed an important,sometimes crucial, role in finding or developing markets for them New markets Bananas are the main crop in Dominica; they are marketed through the Banana Marketing Corporation. Similarly, the bulk of coconut production is processed by Dominica Coconut Products, which manufactures a wide range of value-added coconut-based products including coconut oil and soaps. But green water nuts or jelly nuts, which previously were sold only locally, are now exported by a co-operative of growers which was formed originally to export plantains. DEXIA staff identified a market for jellynuts and plantains among expatriate Dominicans and other West Indians in the United Kingdom. The cooperative supplying this market now exports 16 times the value of plantains each fortnight that it exported in its early months of activity in 1986. Grapefruit and limes are two other long established crops In Dominica, yet new markets have been found for both crops and various products have been developed from limes to supplement the sale of fresh fruit. Mangoes, avocados and various root crops are also being exported in increasing quantities, and so are fresh flowers, herbs and spices (including ginger). DEXIA has worked in parallel with the existing cooperative of flower and ornamental growers to increase production of anthuriums, red ginger lilies and helleconia. New hybrid anthuriums have been introduced, and DEXIA has played a role in improving the quality of packaging. 20 point programme As a statutory government body, DEXIA works to fulfil its brief either by increasing exports in response to existing production or in response to new markets. Production-led export development is where existing crops are available and expansion of the market is sought to absorb surplus existing production. Market-led export development is where a new market is discovered, but either there is no existing production or existing production, does not match market requirements in terms of quality, quantity' or season of supply. Two examples where new markets were identified were red peppers and christophines, both of which have long been grown in Dominica. A visit by a senior DEXIA staff member to Canada established that the market there demanded the Scotch Bonnet variety of red peppers and white christophines. Until then, it was rare to find pure Scotch Bonnet peppers in Dominica and most of the christophines grown were of the green variety, so production was changed to match the special needs of the newly identified market. Marketing assistance In some countries statutory marketing organisations provide the only outlet for some or all products and therefore dominate the market and the farmers. In Dominica government policy is that commercial activity shall {{be in the hands of}} the private sector. Therefore DEXIA'S role is to assist the private sector by helping to form groups of growers; by serving individuals and groups with market intelligence; by advising on transport, credit sources and insurance requirements; and by helping groups to negotiate with shipping and air lines to obtain must favourable terms DEXIA may also test a new market by underwriting the supply of a pilot shipment but, once the needs of the market are established, it is left to the private sector to develop the new market opportunity. An example was when a company in France requested produce grown without ferdlizer or pesticides. Organically grown produce commands significantly higher prices and DEXIA, recognizing this as a potential new market, supplied a <b>trial</b> <b>shipment</b> of grapefruit, dried coconut and herbs. It will now be up to local growers to produce to the criteria specified and to supply further shipments. > is a new phrase for something that skilled traders have always recognised: in a competitive marketplace it is essential to recognize the precise needs of buyers and to judge how best your products can satisfy these needs. And, if a buyer demands a new product, this provides an opportunity for developing new lines of goods. Finally, high quality and efficient transportation remain as vital as ever. Poor {{marketing and}} distribution frequently waste opportunities provided by increased or diversified agricultural production There are many examples where farmers have produced higher yields or cultivated new crops at their own expense and risk but [...] ...|$|E
