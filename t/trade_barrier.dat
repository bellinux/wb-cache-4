They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and as a deterrent to smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in their role as a <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a number of sections of the three successive walls survive, although none of the ports remain.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1989, (B)TRON-based {{system was}} adopted by Japanese {{government}} organizations [...] "Center for Educational Computing" [...] as the system of choice for school education including compulsory education. However, in April, a report titled [...] "1989 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" [...] from Office of the United States Trade Representative have specifically listed {{the system as a}} <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> in Japan. The report claimed that the adoption of TRON-based system by Japanese government is advantageous to Japanese manufacturers, and thus excluding US Operating Systems from the huge new market, specifically the report have listed MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX as examples. The Office of USTR was allegedly under Microsoft's influence as its former officer Tom Robertson was then offered a lucrative position by Microsoft. While the TRON system itself have been subsequently removed from the list of sanction by the Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after protests by the organization in May 1989, the trade dispute have caused Ministry of International Trade and Industry to accept opinion from Masayoshi Son to cancel Center of Educational Computing's selection of TRON-based system for the use of education computers. The incident is regarded as a symbolic event for the lost in momentum and eventual demise of the BTRON system, which have lead to the widespread adoption of MS-DOS system in the Japan and the eventual adoption of Unicode system that ship with their successors.|$|E
2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to examine the}} claim made by Wellington and Zandvakili that Thorstein Veblen would be opposed to globalization. Design/methodology/{{approach}} – The approach of the paper is to examine what Veblen actually said in order to provide evidence from Veblen's own pen. Findings – Veblen forcefully argued that <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> are another form of business sabotage. <b>Trade</b> <b>barriers</b> increase business profits but harm the community as a whole. That is because <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> inhibit specialization, and specialization is required for technological progress. <b>Trade</b> <b>barriers</b> therefore impede progress from the standpoint of humanity as a whole. Practical implications – National boundaries impede technological development because they reduce specialization. <b>Trade</b> <b>barriers</b> make the problem worse, and therefore are harmful. <b>Trade</b> <b>barriers</b> help business {{at the expense of the}} general public. Originality/value – The paper offers an argument for reducing <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> that is not derived from neoclassical economics. It should be of interest to anyone interested in the debate about globalization as well as those interested in Thorstein Veblen. Economic theory, Globalization, <b>Trade</b> <b>barriers...</b>|$|R
