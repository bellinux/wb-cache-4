40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT <b>taxable</b> <b>transactions</b> value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the <b>taxable</b> <b>transactions</b> were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|R
40|$|Diploma Thesis Abstract This thesis {{deals with}} a new {{institute}} in the financial law - an unreliable value added tax payor. This institute was established {{as one of the}} means of improving tax collection and is closely related to the liability of a third party - the payor of value added tax; the recipient of <b>taxable</b> <b>transaction.</b> Listing tax payors in a list of unreliable payors caters to the potential guarantor, but this is at the expense of increasing the administrative burden since the recipient of taxable transactions has to consult the list of tax payors before making any transaction and, as the case may be, enter into a contract in order to gain protection in the event that the provider of <b>taxable</b> <b>transaction</b> is included in the list of unreliable payors. The designation of a value added tax payor as an unreliable payor is not stipulated by law quite clearly, but it is based on an internal regulation known as the Information of the General Tax Directorate. The protection from tax evasion in the form of blacklisting business entities - in the records of unreliable payors - may represent an administrative burden that is too onerous for entrepreneurs as well as substantial financial costs associated with the entire unreliable payor agendas. In all probability, it is also contrary to Council Directive [...] ...|$|E

In contrast to previous research, this study analyzes acquisitions from an investment financing perspective and investigates the tax implications of transaction structure {{for all three}} contracting parties [...] acquiring firm, target firm and target firm shareholders. Results indicate that the probability of an equity-financed tax-free transaction structure is an increasing function of the acquiring firm's likelihood of tax exhaustion.

Evidence in this study fails to support the conclusion that TRA 86 impacted the way in which corporate acquisitions are consummated in the aggregate.

40|$|Value added tax (VAT) is a {{key part}} of the fiscal revenue of many countries. Yet this broad-based tax on {{consumer}} spending exempts financial services. This seems puzzling to many, particularly given the significance of that sector and the size of its value-added in today's world economy. The fact that the European Commission is currently reviewing the tax treatment of financial activities in the EU underscores the importance of addressing the issue. Conventional wisdom holds that taxing financial services under a transaction-based VAT system entails difficulties that render it impossible to tax the services. The thesis investigates where the difficulties lie. The research is undertaken using benchmarks, namely the character of European VAT as an indirect tax on consumption expenditure and the specific features of financial activities, namely that they turn around money and the functions of money. The various key VAT concepts (e. g., taxable person, taxable transactions, taxable amount) are researched in order to establish whether the inclusion of financial activities in the European VAT system entails specific difficulties both from a practical, legal point of view and from a theoretical point of view (in the light of the benchmarks). The thesis contains an extensive investigation of the law inter alia as regards the scope of the exemption for financial services and the scope of the European VAT system. It is found that, particularly with regard to defining the scope of European VAT, what constitutes a <b>taxable</b> <b>transaction,</b> the taxable amount and calculating a deductible proportion, clear practical and theoretical difficulties exists. Finally, the thesis describes and evaluates alternative treatments to an exemption of financial services such as using both additive and cash-flow methods. The current review of financial services is also discussed. It is found that no clear best practice can be established. However, based on both theoretical and practical considerations, a preferred treatment is presented...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{principles}} under which jurisdictions tax income – source and residence. The point of these two principles {{is to establish a}} ‘nexus’ or link between a <b>taxable</b> <b>transaction,</b> operation or activity and a taxing state. It is this nexus which is used to justify the imposition of taxation by the jurisdiction on a particular taxpayer. Where a taxpayer is a ‘resident’ of a jurisdiction, then that person often becomes liable to pay tax on income derived from all sources. Where a taxpayer is a ‘nonresident’ of a jurisdiction, then that person often becomes liable to pay tax on income derived from sources within a particular, relevant jurisdiction. The concept of source of income is fundamentally important to both Australia and Hong Kong. Australia adopts a worldwide tax system that taxes its residents on Australian and foreign income and non-residents on Australian income, whilst Hong Kong adopts a territorial tax system that forgoes taxing foreign income irrespective of who has derived it. The fundamental basis for taxation under a territorial tax system is the source of income; while the fundamental basis for taxation under a worldwide tax system is the concept of residence. In both jurisdictions, the decisions of the courts on the meaning of source have been crucial in defining the concept of ‘source of income’ for tax purposes. The foundations of source-based taxation are less stable today. There is no universal set of source rules that can readily be applied to every circumstance to determine the source or locality of profits. The growth in international trade, supported by the development of electronic commerce, has substantially increased source-related revenue risks. Entities are increasingly able to structure their finances and conduct their affairs without being constrained by geography or national boundaries. Anticipated profits may be shifted to a related party and from one jurisdiction to another to arrive at a reduced overall tax burden. It is becoming increasingly difficult to determine from what and where income originates. The thesis examines the nature of the current source rules in Australia and Hong Kong and analyses the fundamental adequacy of the source principle generally when confronted, especially, with the challenge of rapidly growing Internet-based commercial activities. Australia and Hong Kong have been chosen for comparative study for the following reasons: the two jurisdictions are good examples of small-medium advanced economies; they are similar {{in the sense that they}} are, primarily, knowledge capital-importing jurisdictions; their approaches to ‘source’ differ markedly; and these approaches tend towards each end of the ‘source spectrum’. The thesis identifies certain principal research questions. The basic responses to these questions are: The concept of source of income is, essentially, less clear today in the domestic tax law of Australia and Hong Kong than before. Determining the source of income in Australia and Hong Kong can be a very complex issue. The difficulty related to making such determinations is growing. Searching for the real source of income has become still more problematic with the increase in globalisation and the rapid growth of Internet-based commerce. The traditional concept of source of income has ‘lost traction’ as a fundamental basis for effectively imposing income taxation, especially, in today’s globalised economy. Existing source rules do not deal adequately with certain ‘revenue-leakage’ issues confronting us today and, even more, the likely issues of tomorrow. We need to reconsider how we can better address these issues. The thesis establishes that this is so for Australia and Hong Kong. It also reasons that this proposition generally holds true for most developed tax jurisdictions. The thesis concludes with a detailed review of three of the most prominent optional approaches for addressing the source challenge: (A) a move to a new refundable withholding-tax-based method of taxing cross-border electronic commerce; (B) a shift to far greater reliance on the use of the residence principle of taxation; and (C) a shift to notably greater reliance on (indirect) consumption taxation. Option C, it is argued, offers the best prospects for dealing in the least bad way with the identified issues...|$|E

By the 25 th of the first month of the financial year, any entity must declare the provisional pro rate for the coming year to the tax administration body, which is equal to that determined for the ended year. The method used for capturing the main practical tax and accounting problems inherent to determine the VAT pro rate is the case study made at a pawn shop in Romania over the year 2016. Thus, given the multiplicity of operations carried out by pawnshops (pawnshop with gold and silver goods, pawnshop with electronics, selling goods unclaimed at the expiration of the pawn contracts, melting gold and silver and sale in the form of ingots or bars etc.), in this article there will be discussed the main problems which may occur in practice on the VAT pro rata, using the example of an entity of this kind in Romania for 2016...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes the {{introduction}} of a consumption-based corporate income tax in the European Union. Our proposal would guarantee neutrality regarding investment decisions {{and at the same time}} increase cost-efficiency. The proposal is based on the S-base cash flow tax, where transactions within the corporate sector are not at all <b>taxable</b> and only <b>transactions</b> be-tween shareholders and corporations are subject to tax. In contrast to existing S-base cash flow tax systems, tax deductibility of investments is deferred. Rather, the acquisition costs and capital endowments are compounded at the capital market rate and are set off against fu-ture capital gains. Dividends and withdrawals are fully taxable at the shareholder level. Be-cause of the similarities to the Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) tax our proposal is called Allowance for Shareholder Equity (ASE tax). The ASE tax exhibits the same neutrality properties as the traditional cash flow tax. More-over, the compounded inter-temporal credit method ensures that it is neutral with respect to the decision between domestic and foreign investment. To increase acceptance of the ASE tax, current taxpayers' documentation requirements will be reduced rather than extended. Our proposal is shaped in a way that it could be realized in a single EU country or in all member states of the EU. [...] ...|$|R
