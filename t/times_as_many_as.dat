5|$|The album {{sold over}} 100,000 copies in 1995, over three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> their first album sold. This success ensured that Interscope financed the band's third album, Tragic Kingdom, {{which was a}} massive success, selling 16 million copies {{worldwide}} and attracting extensive interest in the band. The Beacon Street Collection was re-released in 1997 {{as part of the}} band's back catalog.|$|E

Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed {{that a number of}} factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, 100,000 {{copies of}} The Beacon Street Collection had been sold, over three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> their first album, No Doubt. These sales were mostly due to the release of Tragic Kingdom, which was {{released}} seven months after The Beacon Street Collection in October 1995. Tragic Kingdom was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in October 1997, The Beacon Street Collection was re-released on Interscope.|$|E

5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 {{marked the beginning of}} {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City did {{not return}} {{directly}} to Manchester, but instead went to Liverpool, as the club's final league fixture was scheduled for Monday afternoon at Everton. At this point Manchester City were still in contention for the league title. However, a 1–0 defeat at Goodison Park eliminated City from the title race and confirmed The Wednesday as champions. The team arrived in Manchester in that evening, and travelled to the Town Hall to commence a victory parade. From the Town Hall, the parade travelled to Ardwick Conservative Club, via Deansgate, Market Street and Ardwick Green. The number of people lining the route was five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> had attended a recent visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of record}} company support {{frustrated}} {{the band and}} led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing them {{to move away from}} the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> No Doubt sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.|$|E

5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many <b>times</b> (<b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E

25|$|The Southern slavery-based {{societies}} {{had become}} wealthy {{based on their}} cotton and other agricultural commodity production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including textile mills. By 1860, there were four million slaves in the South, nearly eight <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> there were nationwide in 1790. The plantations were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining tobacco regions).|$|E

25|$|In early June 1940, the French {{aviation}} industry {{had reached a}} considerable output, with an estimated reserve of nearly 2,000 aircraft. A chronic lack of spare parts crippled this fleet. Only 29 percent (599) of the aircraft were serviceable, of which 170 were bombers. Low serviceability meant the Germans had a clear numerical superiority in medium bomber aircraft, with six <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> the French. Despite its disadvantages the Armée de l'Air performed far better than expected, destroying 916 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat during the Battle of France, for a kill ratio of 2.35:1, with {{almost a third of}} those kills accomplished by French pilots flying the US built Curtiss Hawk 75, which accounted for 12.6 percent of the French single-seat fighter force.|$|E
25|$|During both {{world wars}} {{the site was}} used as a {{military}} hospital, with up to 200 beds and more than 5000 patients receiving treatment between 1941 and 1945. In 1943, the Board of Education had begun to consider the future of education, following reforms that would inevitably come after the war ended. It was estimated that with the raising of the school leaving age, following the 1944 Education Act, about 70,000 new teachers would be needed annually, almost ten <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> before the war. In 1944 a report was produced by the Board of Education on the emergency recruitment and training of teachers, and it was decided that there were to be several new training colleges set up. These colleges were to be staffed by lecturers seconded from local authorities, with mature students selected from the national service. The City of Manchester was no exception, and a search was undertaken for suitable accommodation for a new emergency training college. In 1945, the theological college, which was no longer required by the Wesleyans, was leased to the Manchester Education Authority, and the new emergency training college was officially opened on 31 January 1946, with Alfred Body as the first principal.|$|E
25|$|Parque Nacionál Amboró {{is one of}} {{the most}} botanically rich {{national}} parks in the world. The current number of documented plant species totals around 3,000, though this is almost certainly an underestimate. By comparison, the much more thoroughly documented and very biologically rich Hawaiian Island archipelago, which covers about six times the total area of Parque Nacional Amboró, has only about 2,800 native plant species, while the British Isles (covering about 65 times the area of Amboró) have only around 2,000. Even the entire California Floristic Province, one of the world's botanical biodiversity hotspots, contains only 8,000 plant species—about 2.5 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> Amboró—though it covers an over 170 times larger. Much of the biodiversity of Amboró is partitioned according to the park's highly dissected topography and the widely varying climatic regimes that accompany the sharp transitions in elevation. Vegetational diversity is equally exceptional within the park, with lowland forests, montane forests, yungas and cloud forest, subpáramo, montane and non-montane scrublands, pampas, cactus forests, palm forests, forests composed almost entirely of treeferns, bromeliad-laden cliffs, epilithic subalpine plant communities, and others. The ecotones between these vegetation types are often sharply delineated according to aspect and elevation, yielding a highly heterogenous landscape that can make traveling in the park a dramatic and surprising experience.|$|E
