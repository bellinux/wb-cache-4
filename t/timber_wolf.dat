5|$|Many other symbols {{have been}} {{proposed}} for addition {{to the list of}} official state symbols but were never officially adopted. Since 1971, the white-tailed deer has been proposed as the state mammal eight times. Other creatures proposed as representations of the state have included the northern leopard frog, the eastern <b>timber</b> <b>wolf,</b> the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, and the Blanding's turtle. In 2007, another proposal, also unsuccessful, was to designate the Tilt-A-Whirl as the state's official amusement ride. It was invented in Faribault in 1926, and debuted at the Minnesota State Fair a year later.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and <b>timber</b> <b>wolf</b> {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>timber</b> <b>wolf</b> being {{a species}} not native to Louisiana, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} {{as to what the}} relocated franchise would be called. Although never officially changed, some of the proposed names included: Rhythm from New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial and Angels from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. After speculation as to where the team would play their home games while a new arena was constructed, Superdome officials notified the league that enough dates would be available to schedule 41 home games at the dome for the 1994–95 season. Prior to this announcement, the team was rumored to play games at the Lakefront Arena, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge or the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi when the Superdome was unavailable.|$|E

25|$|Legion of Super-Heroes was relaunched in September 2011 with issue #1. Simultaneously, DC Comics {{cancelled}} Adventure Comics {{and replaced}} it with a new volume of Legion Lost. While Legion of Super-Heroes continued the adventures of the team from that title's previous volume, Legion Lost featured Wildfire, Dawnstar, <b>Timber</b> <b>Wolf,</b> Tyroc, Tellus, Gates and Chameleon Girl. The Legion Lost characters are stranded on 21st century Earth during a mission to save the future, and they are forced to remain there after contracting a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they returned. The Legion Lost series ended with the time-lost Legionnaires still stranded in the 21st century.|$|E

There are fewer varieties of species as elevation increases which corresponds to the Taiga and Boreal Shield and Cypress Hills Uplands econzones. Mammals which endure the harsh environment in the far north Taiga shield, Boreal Shield and Boreal Plain ecozones are American black bear (Ursus americanus), barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), western moose (Alces alces anderson), hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), American marten (Martes americana), <b>timber</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis lupus), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), mink (Neovison vison), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and red-backed vole (Myodes).|$|E

25|$|After Carnegie's death, an {{electric}} fence was built around Points North Landing's landfill {{to prevent future}} predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone <b>timber</b> <b>wolf</b> attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in Cigar Lake. The worker was on his midnight break when it jumped and mauled him less than one hundred meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him six hundred and seventy-five kilometres {{to a hospital in}} Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing more education to the mining staff members.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1995, a 14-year-old girl {{fell from}} her seat on the coaster and died. The park owner at the time, Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc., and ride manufacturer, Dinn Corporation, said she was {{switching}} seats when the accident occurred. A riding companion claimed that safety restraints (a lap bar and seat belt) had come undone on a sharp turn {{at the top of}} one of the ride's hills. But, Worlds of Fun officials claimed that witnesses had seen her remove her restraints and tried to switch seats and that there had been no malfunction, though her family disputed this. The ride was temporarily closed pending an investigation of its safety features, which resulted in new lap bar installations. Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc. and Dinn Corporation settled with the family for $200,000. This makes the <b>Timber</b> <b>Wolf</b> the only ride so far at Worlds of Fun with a fatality.|$|E

In 2013, Colorado listed rescue dogs and cats as the state pet. California also recently named the [...] "shelter pet" [...] as its state animal, because of all the abandoned shelter pets each year.

500|$|Minnesota {{schoolchildren}} {{have been}} the force behind the successful promotion of four official symbols: the blueberry muffin (1988), the monarch butterfly (2000), the Honeycrisp apple (2006), and ice hockey (2009). The 1918 black-and-white photograph Grace, taken by Eric Enstrom in Bovey and later reproduced as a color painting by his daughter, was named state photograph in 2002. The newest symbol of Minnesota is Lester, declared the state soil in 2012. In addition, many other symbols have been proposed as representations of the state, but for various reasons have been unsuccessful. Suggested animals have included the white-tailed deer, the northern leopard frog, the eastern <b>timber</b> <b>wolf,</b> the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, and the Blanding's turtle. Through the years, the state legislature has also voted on unsuccessful bills to designate the Tilt-A-Whirl as official amusement ride, the works Little House on the Prairie and On the Banks of Plum Creek as state book, [...] "Minnesota Blue" [...] as official poem, {{as well as the}} appointment of a poet laureate position.|$|E
