5|$|Flagstaff {{grew and}} prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} {{started to move}} from the city center, and <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s the {{problems}} with urban sprawl were becoming evident in the United States. When cities improved roads and the transit times were lowered, suburbs developed at ever increasing distances from the city cores, and people moved out of <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>areas.</b> Lacking pollution control systems, the rapid rise in car ownership and the longer trips {{to and from work}} were causing significant air quality problems. Additionally, movement to the suburbs led to a flight of capital from <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>areas,</b> one cause of the rapid urban decay seen in the US.|$|R
5|$|Travel between Haifa and {{the center}} of the country is {{possible}} by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> of the city; the Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> had eased.|$|E
5|$|Despite city {{efforts at}} {{large-scale}} revitalization, {{by the beginning}} of the 21st century <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> consisted largely of the coal export facilities, the shipyard, and municipal offices.

5|$|Interstate 40, the city's major east–west {{thoroughfare}} {{was completed}} entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across {{the center of}} the city. Previously, U.S. Highway 66 was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. to the north of <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan.

I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.|$|E

5|$|The loop {{was created}} in 1974 when I-196 was {{completed}} {{south of the city}} of Holland. From that point, the old route of M-21 inside the cities to US31 was redesignated as a business loop of I-196 with the state taking control of Washington Avenue to <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b> Then from downtown looping back up to Chicago Drive, the business loop used the old M-21. Along Washington Avenue and Chicago Drive between junctions with US31, the highway bore a concurrent Bus. US31 designation. The concurrent trunkline inside <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> of Holland was transferred to the City of Holland in 2005, and BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US31. In 2016, the section of the business loop that runs concurrently with US31 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Resolution [Ordinance] is to foster and {{strengthen}} economic vitality in <b>the</b> local jurisdiction’s <b>downtown</b> core <b>area</b> while respecting and enhancing the special character of the existing development in <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> core <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> <b>downtown</b> core <b>area</b> is a compact assembly of storefront buildings, short walkable blocks, mixed uses, pedestrian amenities, and consolidated on- and off-street parking. <b>The</b> community’s <b>downtown</b> core character is especially vulnerable to intrusion from incompatible uses and physical development practices. <b>The</b> city’s <b>downtown</b> is so important and significant to the city, that it justifies a special set of regulations designed to protect and enhance its character in light of new development. The potential to impact existing development is much less {{in other areas of}} the community than in <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> core <b>area,</b> and hence the regulations outside <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> core <b>area</b> do not merit the same protection. The {{purpose of this}} Resolution [Ordinance] is to establish requirements for building and site design for new developments and for the significant modification of existing developments within <b>the</b> designated <b>downtown</b> core <b>area.</b> This Resolution [Ordinance] is intended to protect the existing character of <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> and encourage orderly development in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the city and with a study and specific plan for <b>the</b> <b>downtown</b> core <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> following principles serve as the foundation for the Downtow...|$|R
