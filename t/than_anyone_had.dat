25|$|A deeper {{investigation}} by the new board found additional problems. Georgine's profits from the stock trade {{were found to be}} far higher <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> guessed—nearly $8.8 million. Georgine and other Ullico executives also received millions of dollars in special bonuses and deferred compensation never approved by the board. O'Sullivan also disclosed that Ullico officers had loaned Georgine $2.2 million to purchase 40,000 shares of low-priced Ullico stock prior to the stock trading scheme, further enlarging his profits, and that Georgine's salary had risen from $900,000 in 1996 to $5.4 million in 2000. Ullico's compensation committee lacked the authority to approve both the loan and the salary increases but did so anyway. O'Sullivan then issued letters to Georgine and the other officers demanding that they refund this money.|$|E
25|$|Charles II {{had become}} king {{following}} the death of his father, Philip IV, in 1665, but he was physically weak and incapable of having children; he was the last male Spanish Habsburg, and he had survived longer <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> expected. When the Treaty of Ryswick (Rijswijk) brought an end to the Nine Years' War (1688–1697), European statesmen turned their attention to resolve the problem of the Spanish Succession before the death of Charles II should actually take place. Ultimately, the main rivals for the Spanish inheritance were the heirs and descendants of the Bourbon King Louis XIV of France, and the Austrian Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, both of whom were sons-in-law to Philip IV of Spain and grandsons of Philip III, and both firmly believed in their claims. However, the inheritance was so vast that its transference would dramatically increase either French or Austrian power, which, due to the implied threat of European hegemony, was of utmost importance to Europe as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} for 137th Brigade {{to capture the}} {{crossings}} and advance {{as far as the}} ‘Brown Line’, after which 138th and 139th brigades would pass through and continue to the ‘Yellow’ and ‘Green Lines’. At 05.50 the Staffords set off, with almost a mile to go before they reached the canal, following a fast-moving rolling barrage of field guns and machine-guns firing overhead. The canal defences had mostly been destroyed by the heavy artillery, which maintained fire until the last possible moment. The Staffords quickly stormed the outposts and the western trench line, and reached the canal bank on time, with few casualties, and having already taken 120 prisoners. There were 1000 German dead in the trenches, mainly from MG bullets. German reports after the battle complained that their ‘SOS barrage’ was late, but in fact it came down only five minutes after Zero – indiscriminately on British and Germans alike – yet the Staffords were advancing faster <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> predicted. The leading parties went over the canal with their improvised kit and by a single plank bridge left by the Germans. The mist protected the attackers from enfilade fire by MGs along the canal, and they seized the Bellenglise tunnel galleries, trapping hundreds of Germans inside.|$|E
25|$|Many Anglo-Saxon {{people needed}} to learn Norman French to {{communicate}} with their rulers, {{but it is clear}} that among themselves they kept speaking Old English, which meant that England was in an interesting tri-lingual situation: Anglo-Saxon for the common people, Latin for the Church, and Norman French for the administrators, the nobility, and the law courts. In this time, and due to the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early Middle English. But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken a lot later than 1066. Research in the early twentieth century, and still continuing today, has shown that a form of Anglo-Saxon was still being spoken, and not merely among uneducated peasants, into the thirteenth century in the West Midlands. This was J.R.R. Tolkien's major scholarly discovery when he studied a group of texts written in early Middle English called the Katherine Group, because they include the Life of St. Katherine (also, the Life of St. Margaret, the Life and the Passion of St. Juliana, Ancrene Wisse, and Hali Meithhad—these last two teaching how to be a good anchoress and arguing for the goodness of virginity). Tolkien noticed that a subtle distinction preserved in these texts indicated that Old English had continued to be spoken far longer <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> supposed. In Old English there is a distinction between two different kinds of verbs.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1990s, The Wiggles {{maintained}} a busy recording and touring schedule, becoming as Field reported and despite his strong dislike of touring, [...] "the hardest-working touring act in the country". [...] They released multiple albums and home videos and, depending upon the word of mouth of their audience, performed to increasingly large audiences in Australia and New Zealand despite having to re-introduce themselves to a new audience of children every three years. [...] They produced a new album and video each year and toured to promote them. [...] By late 1993, they [...] "grew bigger <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> thought", and hundreds attended their concerts; by 1995 they had set records for music and video sales.

500|$|In the [...] "Preface" [...] Hazlitt {{establishes}} {{his focus}} on [...] "characters" [...] by quoting Pope's comment that [...] "every single character in Shakespear, is as much an individual, as those in life itself". After reviewing various other critics of Shakespeare, Hazlitt focuses {{on two of the}} most important, including the influential Dr. Johnson. Hazlitt found the Shakespearean criticism of Johnson, the premier literary critic of the previous era, troubling in several ways. He insufficiently valued the tragedies; he missed the essence of much of the poetry; and he [...] "reduced everything to the common standard of conventional propriety [...] the most exquisite refinement or sublimity produced an effect on his mind, only as they could be translated into the language of measured prose". Johnson also believed that every character in Shakespeare represents a [...] "type" [...] or [...] "species", whereas Hazlitt, siding with Pope, emphasised the individuality of Shakespeare's characters, while discussing them more comprehensively <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> yet done.|$|E

500|$|As English cricket had {{not fully}} {{recovered}} {{from the effects of}} the war, the team which toured Australia was weak in bowling. Confronted by a far better Australian side [...] <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> expected, England lost all five Test matches, an unprecedented result that Wisden regarded as a [...] "disaster". Rhodes now played for Yorkshire as a middle-order batsman and front-line bowler but England's captain Douglas showed uncertainty whether to use Rhodes in this capacity, or to revert to his pre-war role as Hobbs's opening partner. Until the first Test Rhodes batted mainly down the order; after this he returned to opening the batting. On the tour Rhodes scored two centuries, one a double-century, totalling in all 730 runs in all first-class matches at an average of 38.42. Although a leading bowler in England in 1919 and 1920, Rhodes bowled infrequently and with limited success. After taking six for 39 against Victoria in helpful conditions, he rarely bowled, and took only 18 first-class wickets (averaging 26.61) on the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{long road}} from planethood to {{reconsideration}} undergone by Ceres is mirrored {{in the story}} of Pluto, which was named a planet soon after its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto, a tiny and icy world in a region of gas giants with an orbit that carried it high above the ecliptic and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto's largest moon, Charon, which allowed them to determine its mass. Pluto was found to be much tinier <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> expected: only one sixth the mass of Earth's Moon. [...] However, as far as anyone could yet tell, it was unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar to Pluto in composition, size, and orbital characteristics. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised Kuiper belt (sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt), a band of icy debris that is the source for [...] "short-period" [...] comets—those with orbital periods of up to 200 years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of the Antarctic [...] "ozone hole" [...] by British Antarctic Survey scientists Farman, Gardiner and Shanklin (first reported in a paper in Nature in May 1985/NOx interaction |journal=Nature |volume=315 |issue=6016 |pages=207–210 |year=1985 |pmid= |pmc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246650409_Large_losses_of_total_ozone_in_Antarctica_reveal_seasonal_ClOxNOx_interaction| bibcode = 1985Natur.315..207F }}) {{came as a shock}} to the scientific community, because the observed decline in polar ozone was far larger <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> anticipated. Satellite measurements showing massive depletion of ozone around the south pole were becoming available at the same time. However, these were initially rejected as unreasonable by data quality control algorithms (they were filtered out as errors since the values were unexpectedly low); the ozone hole was detected only in satellite data when the raw data was reprocessed following evidence of ozone depletion in in situ observations. When the software was rerun without the flags, the ozone hole was seen as far back as 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Warren was a {{more liberal}} justice <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> anticipated. Warren was able to craft {{a long series of}} {{landmark}} decisions because he built a winning coalition. [...] When Frankfurter retired in 1962 and President John F. Kennedy named labor lawyer Arthur Goldberg to replace him, Warren finally had the fifth liberal vote for his majority. William J. Brennan Jr., a liberal Democrat appointed by Eisenhower in 1956, was the intellectual leader of the activist faction that included Black and Douglas. Brennan complemented Warren's political skills with the strong legal skills Warren lacked and Warren would often have Brennan edit his opinions before they were circulated. Warren and Brennan met before the regular conferences to plan out their strategy. Warren actively sought out lower court cases to overrule precedent, directing his clerks to “keep your eyes peeled for a right to counsel case” as early as 1961.|$|E

2500|$|Modulations, {{changing}} key in {{the course}} of a piece, is another style characteristic where Bach goes beyond what was usual in his time. Baroque instruments vastly limited modulation possibilities: keyboard instruments, prior to a workable system of temperament, limited the keys that could be modulated to, and wind instruments, especially brass instruments such as trumpets and horns, about a century before they were fitted with valves, were tied to the key of their tuning. Bach pushed the limits: he added [...] "strange tones" [...] in his organ playing, confusing the singing, according to an indictment he had to face in Arnstadt, and Louis Marchand, another early experimenter with modulation, seems to have avoided confrontation with Bach because the latter went further <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> done before. In the [...] "Suscepit Israel" [...] of his 1723 Magnificat, he had the trumpets in E-flat play a melody in the enharmonic scale of C minor.|$|E
