5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom was able <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> that Ornitholestes {{was quite different}} from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
