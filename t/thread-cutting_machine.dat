5000|$|On 18th century {{innovation}} in lathe {{was the use}} of a [...] "master screw" [...] in the <b>thread-cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> which seems to have been of French origin. Perrigo explained that [...] "in this lathe there was an arbor upon which threads of different pitches had been cut. These threads were on short sections of the arbor and by its use the different pitches required could be cut. While the exact manner of using this arbor was not described, its probable method of use will readily suggest itself to the mechanic, and was, no doubt, used at an earlier period, and in fact was what led up to the use of a lead screw or arbor with a multiplicity of different pitches. The principle is analogous to that used in the [...] "Fox" [...] brass finishing lathe so well known and extensively used, not only in finishing plain surfaces but in [...] " [...] chasing threads. This machine is shown" [...] in the third image.|$|E
