5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b> <b>In</b> 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E

The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with {{the highest number of}} votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes. The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes. In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple {{for the third time in}} a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, David Ebershoff wrote The Danish Girl, a fictionalized {{account of}} Elbe's life. It was an {{international}} bestseller and {{was translated into}} a dozen languages. In 2015, it {{was made into a}} film, also called The Danish Girl, produced by Gail Mutrux and Neil LaBute and starring Eddie Redmayne as Elbe. The film was well received at the Venice Film Festival in September 2015, although it has been criticized for its casting of a cisgender man to play a transgender woman. Both the novel and the film omitted topics including Gottlieb's sexuality, which is evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> her erotic drawings, and the disintegration of Gottlieb and Elbe's relationship after their annulment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Galician Inflected Infinitive (henceforth II) clauses {{we can get}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> three {{different}} positions: postverbal, preverbal {{or at the very}} end of the clause. The most common unmarked word order obtains when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is either <b>in</b> postverbal position or dropped (Galician is a pro-drop language). I argue that the other two positions are reserved for <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> focus. This paper accounts for all different <b>subject</b> positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> II construction: postverbal (straight in-situ checking), preverbal (by means of a Focus Phrase) and sentence final (by means of p-syntactic movement). The various positions of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> Galician II clauses provide further support for a bifurcation of the syntax into narrow syntax and p-syntax. 1...|$|R

25|$|The half dome of {{the central}} apse has a colossal half-length figure of Christ, with a seated Virgin and Child below; the other apses have {{full-length}} figures of St Peter and St Paul. Inscriptions on each picture explain the subject or saint represented; these are in Latin, except some few which are in Greek. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the nave begin with scenes from the Book of Genesis, illustrating the Old Testament types of Christ and His scheme of redemption, with figures of those who prophesied and prepared for His coming. Around the lower tier and the choir are subjects from the New Testament, chiefly representing Christ's miracles and suffering, with apostles, evangelists and other saints. The design, execution and choice of subjects all appear to be of Byzantine origin, the subjects being selected from the Menologion of Basil II drawn up by the emperor Basil II in the 10th century.|$|E
500|$|Badu's songwriting was {{characterized}} by pointillism, stream of consciousness, and scenic narrative. Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and deeply personal, interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a sense of history and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like {{a laundry list of}} black-community struggles".|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
2500|$|Shahn’s biographer Soby notes [...] "the {{composition}} of the mural at Roosevelt follows the undulant principle Shahn had learned from Diego Rivera: deep recession of space alternating with human and architectural details projected forward." [...] Moreover, the montage effectively intimates the amalgamation of peoples and cultures populating the urban landscape in the early 20th century. Multiple layers and perspectives fuse together to portray a complex industrialized system. Still, the mural maintains a sense of humanity; Shahn gives his figures a monumental quality through volume and scale. The urban architecture does not dwarf the people; instead, they work with the surroundings {{to build their own}} structure. Shahn captured the urgency for activism and reform, by showing gestures and mid-steps and freezing all <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> motion. This pictorial incorporation of [...] "athletic pose and evocative asymmetry of architectural detail" [...] is a Shahn trademark. While exemplifying his visual and social concerns, the mural characterizes the general issues of Shahn's milieu.|$|E
2500|$|Dalek in-universe {{history has}} seen many {{retroactive}} changes, which have caused continuity problems. When the Daleks first appeared, they were presented as {{the descendants of}} the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when their power supply is wrecked. However, when they reappear in The Dalek Invasion of Earth, they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in Genesis of the Daleks, where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which [...] "Daleks" [...] is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros. Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which caused widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> tank-like [...] "travel machines" [...] whose design was based on his own life-support chair.|$|E

2500|$|Hollin's wife, Evalina Knapp was the {{daughter}} of William Knapp, one of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> Waldo and Jewett's painting, The Knapp Children, circa 1834. [...] Evalina inherited the painting and in 1959, it was donated to the Metropolitan Museaum of Art in New York by the wife of Harry's and Evalina's son, John Knapp Hollins, in John's memory. [...] In 2016, amateur East Islip historian Steven Cymbalski had been reviewing a late 19th century photograph of the Hollins family as seated in the dining room of their East Islip mansion and noticed a painting hanging on the wall in the background; further inspection revealed it was Waldo and Jewett's [...] "The Knapp Children". [...] Having known of the painting and realizing the significance of this, Mr. Cymbalski notified the Metropolitan Museum who at that point had not had a photograph of the famed painting hanging in its natural environs and termed the discovery [...] "quite a find." [...] A scan of the photograph has been provided to the museum. [...] The photograph and the story of the painting's discovery in it has been placed in the file on the painting at the Met.|$|E
2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a single-blind test is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but {{is not supposed to}} reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b> <b>In</b> addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing person employed by the company which is producing the challenge, there's always the possibility of a conflict of interest where the marketing person is aware that future income will be {{based on the results of}} the test.|$|E
2500|$|In short, Netscape {{focused on}} {{creating}} software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing {{it to the}} end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with Google, a company that did not at the time focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its [...] "PageRank" [...] algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called [...] "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and Wikipedia: while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the open source software adage [...] "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any [...] "bugs" [...] or other problems. Wikipedia's volunteer editor community produces, edits and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.|$|E
