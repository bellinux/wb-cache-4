5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins <b>totalizing</b> ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics {{might seem to}} make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the <b>totalizing</b> rule of God that informs much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.|$|E
25|$|The {{railway network}} is also extensive, {{especially}} in the north, <b>totalizing</b> 16,862km of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the 12th largest in the world, and is operated by state-owned Ferrovie dello Stato, while the rail tracks and infrastructure are managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana. While a number of private railroads exist and provide mostly commuter-type services, the national railway also provides sophisticated high-speed rail service that joins the major cities. The Florence–Rome high-speed railway was the first high-speed line opened in Europe when {{more than half of}} it opened in 1977. In 1991 the TAV was created for the planning and construction of high-speed rail lines along Italy's most important and saturated transport routes (Milan-Rome-Naples and Turin-Milan-Venice). High-speed trains include ETR-class trains, with the Frecciarossa 1000 reaching 400km/h.|$|E

2500|$|Italy was {{hit hard}} by the Great Recession. The {{national}} real growth shrunk by 4.55% during the period 2012-2013, <b>totalizing</b> seven-quarters of recession. In November 2011 the Italian bond yield was 6.74 percent for 10-year bonds, nearing a 7 percent level where Italy is thought to lose access to financial markets. According to Eurostat, in 2015 the Italian government debt stood at 128% of GDP, ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after Greece (with 175%). However, the biggest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by Italian nationals [...] and relatively high levels of private savings {{and low levels of}} private indebtedness are seen as making it the safest among Europe's struggling economies. As a result of austerity measures, Italy is targeting a public budget deficit of 2.8% in 2015, remaining inside the European Union's 3 percent ceiling.|$|E

2500|$|Gorgias’ {{writings}} {{are intended}} to be both rhetorical (persuasive) and performative. He goes {{to great lengths to}} exhibit his ability of making an absurd, argumentative position appear stronger. [...] Consequently, each of his works defend positions that are unpopular, paradoxical and even absurd. The performative nature of Gorgias’ writings is exemplified by the way that he playfully approaches each argument with stylistic devices such as parody, artificial figuration and theatricality (Consigny 149). [...] Gorgias’ style of argumentation can be described as poetics-minus-the-meter (poiêsis-minus-meter). [...] Gorgias argues that persuasive words have power (dunamis) that is equivalent to that of the gods and as strong as physical force. [...] In the Encomium, Gorgias likens the effect of speech on the soul to the effect of drugs on the body: [...] "Just as different drugs draw forth different humors from the body – some putting a stop to disease, others to life – so too with words: some cause pain, others joy, some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion" [...] (Gorgias 32). The Encomium [...] "argues for the <b>totalizing</b> power of language." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Bakhtin’s life {{work can}} be {{understood}} as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time." [...] True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, <b>totalizing</b> ways." [...] According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience." [...] Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of Clifford Geertz’s theories on culture." [...] Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one’s understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Michel Foucault, in his {{preface to}} Anti-Oedipus, {{writes that the}} book can best be read as an [...] "art", {{in the sense that}} is {{conveyed}} by the term [...] "erotic art." [...] Foucault sees the three [...] "adversaries" [...] of Anti-Oedipus as being the [...] "bureaucrats of the revolution", the [...] "poor technicians of desire" [...] (psychoanalysts and semiologists), and fascism, which Foucault calls [...] "the major enemy". Foucault uses the term [...] "fascism" [...] to refer [...] "not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us." [...] Foucault adds that Anti-Oedipus is [...] "a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time", and that this perhaps its popular success. Foucault suggests that the book could be called Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life. Foucault argues that putting the principles espoused in Anti-Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from [...] "unitary and <b>totalizing</b> paranoia" [...] and withdrawing allegiance [...] "from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality." [...] The psychiatrist David Cooper calls Anti-Oedipus, [...] "a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force", crediting its authors with using [...] "the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors), linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment." [...] The critic Frederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari [...] "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" [...] and [...] "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" [...] in Anti-Oedipus, their [...] "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" [...] and [...] "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris." ...|$|E
