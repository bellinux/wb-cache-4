5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the <b>two</b> <b>complexes,</b> there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Romulus, I-275 begins {{to take on a}} more {{suburban}} character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. There is access to {{the south side of the}} airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I-94. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins to run to the northwest. South of I-94, the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line and north of I-94, it passes a campus of Wayne County Community College and the headquarters of the Visteon Corporation, a major auto parts supplier spun off from Ford Motor Corporation. Near these <b>two</b> <b>complexes,</b> the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac, US12 (Michigan Avenue) and M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit.|$|E

25|$|The least ancient, {{but most}} persuasive, {{evidence}} of domestication comes from sites where horse leg bones and skulls, probably originally attached to hides, were interred with {{the remains of}} chariots in at least 16 graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures. These were located in the steppes southeast of the Ural Mountains, between the upper Ural and upper Tobol Rivers, a region today divided between southern Russia and northern Kazakhstan. Petrovka was a little later than and probably grew out of Sintashta, and the <b>two</b> <b>complexes</b> together spanned about 2100–1700 BCE.

The marriage hall was built by the Hoysalas in the thirteenth century and a wall of the second complex was built by the Vijayanagar kings. Beautiful stone carvings are a popular tourist site and are a source of inspiration for students of art and architecture.|$|E
25|$|The genus has {{a highly}} disjunct {{distribution}} spread across two major groups of tepuis: the western range in Amazonas {{and the eastern}} range in Bolívar. The western range can be further subdivided into <b>two</b> <b>complexes</b> of neighbouring tepuis. The more southerly of these consists of Cerro de la Neblina, Cerro Aracamuni, and Cerro Avispa, and supports four Heliamphora species. The more northerly group of the western range, home to only two species, includes the massive Cerro Duida and neighbouring Cerro Huachamacari and Cerro Marahuaca. The remaining 17–19 species are native to the eastern range, which includes the Aprada Massif, Auyán Massif, Chimantá Massif, Eastern Tepuis chain, Los Testigos chain, {{and a number of}} outlying tepuis. Many of the summits of the eastern range are situated on a vast plateau known as the Gran Sabana. Only two species (H.ciliata and H.heterodoxa) are known with certainty from the Gran Sabana, and only H.ciliata is endemic to this habitat.|$|E
25|$|Residence Life at York University {{is part of}} the Centre for Student Community and Leadership Development (SCLD), {{that manages}} the eight {{residence}} buildings on the Keele campus. These Residences are divided into <b>two</b> <b>complexes</b> on either side of campus: Complex 1 includes Winters Residence, Tatham Hall Residence, Vanier Residence, and Founders Residence; Complex 2 includes Bethune Residence, Calumet Residence, Stong Residence, and Pond Residence (the newest residence, and sometimes referred to as Complex 3 grouped with the York Apartments). Each residence is linked to one of the aforementioned colleges, but since 2007 have been managed through SCLD rather than the Master's Offices of each College. Residence Life works closely in partnership with Student Housing Services, a separate campus office. Residence Life provides and manages the student programming and support, while Housing Services manages the facilities, room placements and application processes. The Residence Life Staff is composed of Residence Life Coordinators, Residence Dons, and Night Porters designated to each building. Residence Life also maintains important partnerships with several campus services, including but not limited to Security Services, Food Services, Sport and Recreation, Centre for Human Rights, Office of Student Conflict Resolution, York Federation of Students, and Colleges and College Councils.|$|E

25|$|Due to the aim {{to design}} photoswitchable {{materials}} that have higher working temperatures than those reported to date (~80 K), along with long-lifetime photoexcited states, another strategy for SCO called Ligand-Driven Light Induced Spin Change (LD-LISC) has been studied. This method consists {{of using a}} ligand that is photosensitive in order to trigger the spin interconversion of the metal ion and exciting this ligand with light. The LD-LISC effect {{is followed by a}} structural change of the photoresponsive ligands in contrast to the SCO process where the structures of the ligands are essentially unaffected. The driving force behind the metal ion SCO in this photochemical transformation is cis-trans photoisomerization. The prerequisite for LD-LISC to be observed is that the <b>two</b> <b>complexes</b> formed with the ligand photoisomers, must exhibit different magnetic behaviors as a function of temperature. Upon successive irradiations of the system at two different wavelengths within a temperature range where the metal ion can either be LS or HS, a spin-state interconversion should occur. In order to achieve this, it is convenient to design a metal environment to where {{at least one of the}} complexes exhibits a thermally induced SCO. The LD-LISC has been observed in several iron(II) and iron(III) complexes.|$|E
500|$|Instead of {{a single}} island {{superstructure}} containing both the ship's navigation bridge and flying control (flyco) centres, the ships will have these operations divided between two structures, with the forward island for navigating the ship and the aft island for controlling flying operations. The primary reason for having twin islands was to space out the funnels, as the ships were designed with redundancy with [...] "duplicated main and secondary machinery in <b>two</b> <b>complexes</b> with independent uptakes and downtakes {{in each of the}} two islands", while the alternative of consolidating all the exhaust trunkings would have reduced hangar space as well as being a flooding vulnerability. There are also additional benefits to having separate islands rather than a single large island, such as easier construction, reduced wind turbulence, and freed up deck space. Using two structures provides separate mountings for the air surveillance radar (forward) from interfering with the medium range radar (aft); furthermore visibility is improved for both navigation and landing operations.|$|E
