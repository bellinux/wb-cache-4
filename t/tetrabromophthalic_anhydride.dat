5000|$|Organobromine {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used as fire-retardants. [...] The most prominent member is tetrabromobisphenol-A (4,4'-(1-methylethylidene)bis-(2,6-di-bromophenol), see figure). It and <b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> are precursors to polymers wherein the backbone features covalent carbon-bromine bonds. Other fire retardants, such as hexabromocyclododecane and the bromodiphenyl ethers, are additives and are not chemically attached to the material they protect. The use of organobromine fire-retardants is growing but is also controversial because they are persistent pollutants.|$|E
40|$|Tetrafunctional cardo {{epoxy resin}} (EBCF) was cured by using 10 wt% maleic {{anhydride}} (MA), pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), phthalic anhydride (PA), tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (THPA), <b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TBPA), and tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA) as hardeners at 120 °C for 40 – 105 min (gel time) and then postcured 1 h at 130 °C. Gel time {{is found to}} depend on the structure of the anhydrides used. Cured samples were found insoluble in common solvents. Cured and uncured EBCF were characterized by FTIR, DSC, and TGA techniques. Cured and uncured resins followed multistep degradation reactions. Kinetic parameters, namely, order of degradation, energy of activation, frequency factor, and entropy change, were determined according to the Anderson-Freeman method and interpreted in light of the nature of hardeners used for curing purpose. The resins followed integral or fractional order degradation kinetics. Complex degradation reactions are due to different types of linkages in cured resins. Both nature and structure of resin and hardeners affected the curing behavior and the resultant thermal properties of the cured resins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Analytical {{method for}} the {{determination}} of six flame retardants (FRs) from two groups was pro-posed. These groups included the brominated flame retardants (BFRs) 3, 3 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 -hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and <b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TBPA) and triester organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) tris(2, 3 -dibromopropyl) phosphate (TBPP), ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP). Reversed phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with a UV detector, different chromatographic columns, different mobile phases and gradient elution programmes were used to obtain the best separations within the shortest possible time. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was examined as a pre-concentration step from distilled water. The columnwith the highest recoveries (the Bond Elut ENV column gave recoveries over 70 % for all compounds) was then tested on 1 -L blank surface water samples. The proposed analytical procedure was applied for {{the determination of}} FRs in surface water samples. The concentrations of FRs found in water samples ranged from 0. 03 (TPhP) to 3. 10 μg L− 1 (HBCD). Method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0. 008 to 0. 518 μg L− 1, and method quan-tification limits (MQLs) ranged from 0. 023 to 1. 555 μg L− 1 for all compounds...|$|E
40|$|With more {{stringent}} legislation on brominated flame retardants, {{it is expected}} that increasing amounts of substitutes would replace polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). Therefore, the development and optimization of analytical methodologies that allow their identification and quantification are of paramount relevance. This work describes the optimization of an analytical procedure to determine pentabromochlorocyclohexane, tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene, 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrabromo-p-xylene, <b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - pentabromotoluene, tris(2, 3 -dibromopropyl) phosphate, decabromodiphenylethane and 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane together with PBDEs in sediments and in suspended particulate matter. This method comprises a pressurized liquid extraction followed by three cleanup steps (gel permeation chromatography and solid phase extraction on Oasis™ HLB and on silica cartridges). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, using electron capture negative chemical ionization, is used for the final analysis. The proposed method provides recoveries > 85 %. The method was applied to sediment and suspended particulate matter samples from different locations in the Western Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the occurrence of the additive flame retardants 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrabromo-p-xylene, 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentabromochlorocyclohexane is reported in the literature. The concentrations of these new flame retardants ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 30 μg/kg dry weight. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) {{are used to}} reduce the {{flammability}} of plastics, textiles, and electronics. BFRs vary in their chemical properties and structures, and {{it is expected that}} these differences alter their biological interactions and toxicity. Zebrafish were used as the model organism for assessing the toxicity of nine structurally-diverse BFRs. In addition to monitoring for overt toxicity, the rate of spontaneous movement, and acetylcholinesterase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were assessed following exposure. The toxicities of BFRs tested can be ranked by LC 50 as tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) < 4, 4 ′-isopropylidenebis[2 -(2, 6 -dibromophenoxyl) ethanol] (TBBPA-OHEE) < Pentabromochlorocyclohexane (PBCH) < 2 -ethylhexyl 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) < hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) < hexabromobenzene (HBB) < <b>Tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (PHT 4). No adverse effect was observed in di(2 -ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH) or dibromoneopentyl glycol (DBNPG) -treated embryos. The rate of spontaneous movement was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner following exposure to four of the nine compounds. GST activity was elevated following treatment with PBCH, TBBPA, HBCD, and HBB. The results indicate that exposure to several BFRs may activate an antioxidant response and alter behavior during early development. Some of the BFRs, such as TBBPA and TBBPA-OHEE, induced adverse effects at concentrations lower than chemicals that are currently banned. These results suggest that zebrafish are sensitive to exposure to BFRs and {{can be used as a}} comparative screening model, as well as to determine alterations in behavior following exposure and probe mechanisms of action...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of the candidate drug molecule and its metabolites in biofluids and tissues is an inevitable step {{in the development of}} new pharmaceuticals. Because of the time-consuming and expensive nature of the current standard technique for quantitative metabolite profiling, i. e., radiolabeling followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with radiodetection, the development of alternative methodologies is of great interest. In this work, a simple, fast, sensitive, and accurate method for the quantitative metabolite profiling of an amino group containing drug (levothyroxine) and its metabolites in human plasma, based on precolumn derivatization followed by HPLC-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), was developed and validated. To introduce a suitable "heteroelement" (defined here as an element that is detectable with ICPMS), an inexpensive and commercially available reagent, <b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TBPA) was used for the derivatization of free NH 2 -groups. The presence of a known number of I atoms in both the drug molecule and its metabolites enabled a cross-validation of the newly developed derivatization procedure and quantification based on monitoring of the introduced Br. The formation of the derivatives was quantitative, providing a 4 : 1 stoichiometric Br/NH 2 ratio. The derivatives were separated via reversed-phase HPLC with gradient elution. Bromine was determined via ICPMS at a mass-to-charge ratio of 79 using H- 2, as a reaction gas to ensure interference-free detection, and iodine was determined at a mass-to-charge ratio of 127 for cross-validation purposes. The method developed shows a fit-for-purpose accuracy (recovery between 85 % and 115 %) and precision (repeatability < 15 % RSD). The limit of quantification (LoQ) for Br was approximately 100 mu g/L...|$|E
40|$|Brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) {{are used}} as {{additives}} in plastics to decrease the rate of combustion of these materials, leading to greater consumer safety. As the use of plastics has increased, the production and use of flame-retardants has also grown. Many BFRs are persistent and have been detected in environmental samples, raising concerns about the biological/toxicological risk associated with their use. Most BFRs appear to be non-toxic, however {{there is still some}} concern that these compounds, or possible contaminants in BFRs mixtures could interact with cellular receptors. In this study we have examined the interaction of decabromodiphenyl ether, Firemaster BP 4 A (tetrabromobisphenol A), Firemaster PHT 4 (<b>tetrabromophthalic</b> <b>anhydride),</b> hexabromobenzene, pentabromotoluene, decabromobiphenyl, Firemaster BP- 6 (2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 5, 5 '-hexabromobiphenyl) and possible contaminants of BFR mixtures with the Ah receptor. Receptor binding and activation was examined using the Gel Retardation Assay and increased expression of dioxin responsive genes was detected using the reporter gene based CALUX assay. The results demonstrate the ability of BFRs to activate the AhR signal transduction pathway at moderate to high concentrations as assessed using both assays. AhR-dependent activation by BFRs may be due in part to contaminants present in commercial/technical mixtures. This was suggested by our comparative analysis of Firemaster BP- 6 versus its primary component 2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 5, 5 '-hexabromobiphenyl. Some technical mixtures of brominated flame-retardants contain brominated biphenyls, dioxins or dibenzofurans as contaminants. When tested in the CALUX assay these compounds were found to be equivalent to, or more active than their chlorinated analogues. Relative effective potency values were determined from dose response curves for these brominated HAHs. (c) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd. status: publishe...|$|E
