40|$|In Arabidopsis, the {{induction}} of a dehydration-responsive gene, rd 22, is mediated by abscisic acid (ABA) and requires protein biosynthesis for ABA-dependent gene expression. Previous experiments established that a 67 -bp DNA fragment of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 22 promoter {{is sufficient for}} dehydration- and ABA-induced gene expression and that this DNA fragment contains two closely located putative recognition sites for the basic helix-loop-helix protein MYC and one putative recognition site for MYB. We have carefully analyzed the 67 -bp region of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 22 promoter in transgenic tobacco plants and found that both the first MYC site and the MYB recognition site function as cis-acting elements in the dehydration-induced expression of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 22 gene. A cDNA encoding a MYC-related DNA binding protein was isolated by DNA-ligand binding screening, using the 67 -bp region as a probe, and designated rd 22 BP 1. <b>The</b> <b>rd</b> 22 BP 1 cDNA encodes a 68 -kD protein that has a typical DNA binding domain of a basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif in MYC-related transcription factors. <b>The</b> <b>rd</b> 22 BP 1 protein binds specifically to the first MYC recognition site in the 67 -bp fragment.

40|$|The {{inherited}} {{retinal degeneration}} of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> mouse {{results in the}} exclusive loss of one cell type, the photoreceptors. We took advantage of this visual-cell loss to devise a strategy for the isolation of photoreceptor-specific cDNAs based {{on the use of}} subtractive and differential hybridizations. The resulting pool of photoreceptor-specific cDNAs was screened for a candidate cDNA for <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> gene, and a putative rd cDNA that maps to mouse chromosome 5, the chromosome to which <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> gene has been assigned, was identified. On Northern blots <b>the</b> candidate <b>rd</b> cDNA hybridizes a 3. 3 -kilobase RNA species from 9 - to 11 -day-old developing normal retina and, much more faintly, a 3. 6 -kb RNA species from age-matched <b>rd</b> retina. <b>The</b> 0. 3 -kilobase difference {{in the size of the}} mRNAs hybridized suggests that a structural alteration in the gene corresponding to <b>the</b> candidate <b>rd</b> cDNA has occurred in <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> mouse.

40|$|Retinal {{degeneration}} in <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> mouse is inherited as an {{autosomal recessive}} trait and {{is caused by}} a defect in the gene encoding the beta subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase.

In this study, genomic DNA mapping and sequence analyses clarify the position of the proviral sequences in relation to <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> gene.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>rd</b> 7 mouse, {{an animal}} model for {{hereditary}} retinal degeneration, has some characteristics similar to human flecked retinal disorders. Here we report {{the identification of}} a deletion in a photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (mPNR) mRNA {{that is responsible for}} hereditary retinal dysplasia and degeneration in <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 7 mouse. mPNR was isolated from a pool of photoreceptor-specific cDNAs originally created by subtractive hybridization of mRNAs from normal and photoreceptorless rd mouse retinas. Localization of the gene corresponding to mPNR to mouse Chr 9 near <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 7 locus made it a candidate for the site of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 7 mutation. Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from rd 7 mouse retinas revealed no detectable signal after hybridization with the mPNR cDNA probe. However, with reverse transcription–PCR, we were able to amplify different fragments of mPNR from rd 7 retinal RNA and to sequence them directly. We found a 380 -nt deletion in the coding region of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 7 mPNR message that creates a frame shift and produces a premature stop codon. This deletion accounts for more than 32 % of the normal protein and eliminates a portion of the DNA-binding domain. In addition, it may result in the rapid degradation of <b>the</b> <b>rd</b> 7 mPNR message by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, preventing the synthesis of the corresponding protein.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>rd</b> 3 mouse {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{identified}} models of early-onset retinal degeneration. Using the positional candidate approach, we have identified a C -> T substitution in a novel gene, Rd 3, that encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein of 195 amino acids. <b>The</b> <b>rd</b> 3 mutation results in a predicted stop codon after residue 106. This change is observed in four rd 3 lines derived from the original collected mice but not in the nine wild-type mouse strains that were examined. Rd 3 is preferentially expressed in the retina and exhibits increasing expression through early postnatal development. In transiently transfected COS- 1 cells, <b>the</b> <b>RD</b> 3 -fusion protein shows subnuclear localization adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia-gene-product bodies. <b>The</b> truncated mutant <b>RD</b> 3 protein is detectable in COS- 1 cells but appears to get degraded rapidly.

In addition to several alterations of uncertain significance, we identified a homozygous alteration in the invariant G nucleotide of <b>the</b> <b>RD</b> 3 exon 2 donor splice site in two siblings with Leber congenital amaurosis.
