When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E

25|$|Through the {{combined}} efforts of two Phoenix philanthropists, Walter Bimson and Lewis Ruskin, Waddell received a commission in 1970 {{to create a}} major work for downtown Phoenix. When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute. Although the piece has been moved from its original location in the Phoenix Civic Plaza <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{in front of the}} Herberger Theater, it remains Waddell’s tour de force in his adopted home of Arizona.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself {{came out on the}} side and could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it to plow the tracks and the section from the tracks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> It remained in operation until 1950.|$|E
25|$|The two {{walked out}} of the library at 11:36a.m., ending the hostage {{situation}} there. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 34 uninjured and 10 injured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north door, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson joined Brian Anderson and the three library staff in the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots. They locked themselves in and remained there until they were freed, at approximately 3:30p.m.|$|E

25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E
500|$|Loughner {{proceeded}} to fire apparently randomly at {{other members of}} the crowd. He reportedly used a 9×19mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol with a 33-round magazine. A nearby store employee said he heard [...] "15 to 20 gunshots". Loughner stopped to reload, but dropped the loaded magazine from his pocket <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> from where bystander Patricia Maisch grabbed it. Another bystander clubbed the back of the assailant's head with a folding chair, injuring his elbow in the process, representing the fourteenth injury. Loughner was tackled to the ground by Bill Badger, a 74-year-old retired United States Army Colonel [...] who had also been shot himself. Loughner was further subdued by Maisch and bystanders Roger Sulzgeber and Joseph Zamudio. Zamudio, a concealed weapon (CCW) permit holder, had a weapon on his person, but arrived after the shooting had stopped and did not draw his firearm. Thirty-one shell casings were found at the scene by investigators.|$|E
500|$|According to The Tombstone Epitaph, [...] "Wyatt Earp {{stood up}} and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit." [...] Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, {{disabling}} his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He {{tried and failed to}} grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. [...] Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, [...] "That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him." [...] Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank. [...] Frank fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{on the east side of}} Fremont Street.|$|E

500|$|The local {{transportation}} company, CTP, manages a tram line {{that runs through}} the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This will bring a number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, long use expectancy and higher transit speed – [...] The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street, between the Chamber of Commerce and the central rail station, a rather problematic area. This dilemma should be solved either with the relocation of the track next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> or through the construction of a suspended tunnel. Another area that will benefit from large-scale changes is [...] "Splaiul Independenței", where the tracks will be pulled back to the Central Park, so that the roadway can host two lanes. In the Mănăștur area, under the bridge, the tracks will be brought closer, while other major works will executed on the traffic circle on Primăverii Street. Given the development of the metropolitan area, further plans feature the creation of a light rail track between Gilău and Jucu that will use these modernised tracks in the city.|$|E
500|$|Two marches were {{organized}} in Portland. The [...] "We the People: Marching in Resistance" [...] rally included groups such as: Oregon's Union Movement, Basic Rights Oregon, Unite Oregon, and the Northwest Oregon Labor Council. The event {{was held at}} Director Park and the groups had a permit to march. Don't Shoot Portland organized a demonstration {{in front of the}} Edith Green – Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, where a small group of protestors faced off with police. This second protest did not have a permit and consisted of a couple of hundred people. The police were in riot gear and pushed the crowd out of the street. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested for blocking traffic. One protester was tackled by the police and then shot with non-lethal projectiles. One man who was reportedly [...] "one step off the curb" [...] in the street was pushed to the ground by police, had his arms pinned to his back, and was then pepper-sprayed in the face; and a woman was shoved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and then shot by police with [...] "pepper balls". A 66-year-old woman was also tackled and hurt by the police when she attempted to shield her 72-year-old friend from being pushed. Several of the people arrested were minors, with six young people including a 14-year-old being cited. The adults were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in the second degree, with one man also being charged with resisting arrest and giving false information to the police.|$|E
