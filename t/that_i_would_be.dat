5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
500|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} to depart. His French connections meant that he was vulnerable to deportation or imprisonment {{under the terms of}} the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson was concerned that the U.S. and France were verging on the brink of war after the XYZ Affair and regarded him as an informal envoy. Kościuszko later wrote, [...] "Jefferson considered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the most effective intermediary in bringing an accord with France, so I accepted the mission even if without any official authorization." ...|$|E
500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label. [...] "They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money. They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox. And I never wanted that. That wasn't what it was about for me. I pretty much had a sense of myself, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an imposter," [...] Lords said.|$|E

500|$|English actor Chris Coxon {{played the}} role of SpongeBob. Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I {{can do a lot of}} the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the {{following}} two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept {{flat on his back}} for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support of his wife and family, as he later confessed, [...] "I often felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better dead." [...] Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile {{for the first time since}} the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were Das Kapital, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler.|$|E
500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry told {{interviewer}} Kimberly Grant, [...] "The {{hard part}} {{for me was}} to try to stay connected to Phillips and Welson." [...] This was because, Grant writes, [...] "she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor." [...] Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut, Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: [...] "That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level , so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the same level as they [...] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{able to make the}} mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E

500|$|Solo {{played in}} 22 WPS matches in 2010 {{for both the}} Athletica and the Beat and was the league-leader in saves with 104. The two-time WPS All-Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts (6), wins (6), and goals against average (1.64). After {{the end of the}} 2010 season, Solo {{underwent}} surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. [...] "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I wanted to make sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> giving my team and my country my best on the field," [...] Solo said of the surgery. [...] "I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so {{it was time to get}} it taken care of." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My Moment" [...] is a self-empowerment {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song [...] "is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, [...] "Friday". Black starts singing the lyrics [...] "Weren't you {{the one who said}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nothing?/ Well, I'm about to prove you wrong/ I'm {{not the only one who}} believes in something/ My one wish is about to come true." [...] As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, [...] "Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't talk to you right now/I'm getting my paper". [...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background. Uses of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on Black's vocals were also noticed.|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record is very nice. I would never have imagined in years <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to obtain it. I am very proud and I hope I can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

500|$|The figure's {{mouth is}} opened wide as if screaming, an {{expression}} Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.

[...] On 1 November, PewDiePie became the first channel to reach 15 million subscribers; the following day, the channel was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight account {{at the top of the}} site's subscriber rankings.

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
