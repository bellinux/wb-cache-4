5|$|Rodis's input in {{developing}} the early character and costume designs was significant. Shatner praised his costume designs as being futuristic but plausible and {{in keeping with the}} continuity established in previous Star Trek films. After being disappointed by <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> designers approached to realize Rodis' ideas, Shatner suggested that Rodis become <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> designer as well. Bennett hired Dodie Shepard as <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> supervisor; Shepard's role was to oversee <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> fabrication and keep track of the clothes during filming. To save on costs, Shepard clothed extras with existing items from Western Costume's warehouses. The constrained budget meant Shatner could not completely redesign the Starfleet uniforms, but Rodis created new brown field uniforms for the film's location scenes as well as the leisure clothes the crew wears during shore leave.|$|E
