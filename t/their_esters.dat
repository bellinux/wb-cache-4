40|$|In honeybees, worker {{policing}} via egg eating enforces functional worker sterility in colonies with a {{queen and}} brood. It {{is thought that}} queens mark their eggs with a chemical signal, indicating that their eggs are queen-laid. Worker-laid eggs lack this signal and are, therefore, eaten by policing workers. Anarchistic worker honeybees have been hypothesized to circumvent worker policing by mimicking the queen egg-marking signal. We investigated this phenomenon by relating chemical profiles of workers and their eggs to egg acceptability. We found that the ability of some workers (anarchistic workers in queenright colonies and deviant workers from a queenless colony) to lay more acceptable eggs is due to them producing significant amounts of queen-like <b>esters</b> from <b>their</b> Dufour’s gland. These esters appear {{to be transferred to}} eggs during laying and increase egg survival. However, these esters cannot be the normal queen egg-marking signal, as they are generally absent from queen-laid eggs and only increase the short-term persistence of worker-laid eggs, because only 7 – 30 % of anarchistic worker-laid eggs persisted to hatching versus 91 – 92 % of queen-laid eggs. All workers can produce some esters, but only workers that greatly increase <b>their</b> <b>ester</b> production lay more acceptable eggs. The production of esters appears to be a flexible response, as anarchistic workers reared in queenless colonies did not increase <b>their</b> <b>ester</b> production, while some deviant workers in queenless colonies did increase <b>their</b> <b>ester</b> production.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the n-alkanes are also unbranched fatty acids with more than four carbon atoms, <b>their</b> <b>esters</b> and unbranched fatty alcohols can migrate into the channels of the crystallized urea and form a clathrate. The initial discovery of the method {{was based on a}} study of the fats in milk. A deviation from the linear molecular geometry, for example, by C=C-double bonds in the molecule, leads to a less stable inclusion compound. Thus stearic acid (C18: 0) forms more stable urea adducts compared to oleic acid (C18: 1 cis -9) or linoleic acid (C18: 2 cis -9, cis -12). A branching in the fatty acid molecule or an autoxidation result in a large deviation from the straight-chain molecular structure, so that these compounds do not form urea adducts. This is used as part of the fatty acid analysis and for the separation or enrichment of specific fatty acids.|$|E
