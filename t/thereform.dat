In 1898 his drafts for smaller country housesand Biedermeier-style furniture were unusually simple and modest for those days.Excentric drafts {{followed in the}} style of Art Nouveau with highly coloured façades,such as the well-known houses in Munich's Schwabing area (see below). Soon Haigerturned away from the Art Nouveau style, freely using elements of the 18th and early19th century architecture, which became characteristic for his later designs. In hisdrafts for large-scale buildings during the Nazi period - modified by Hitler'sinterventions - one finds elements of Troost's new Neoclassicism (fluted pillars,right-angled profiles).|$|E

40|$|In {{academic}} and policy debates {{on how to}} effectively secure land tenure, an uncompromising belief inthe need to formalize and title landownership has increasingly given way to an acknowledgement of thecontributions non-state, ‘customary’ or otherwise local institutions may make in securing tenure. How-ever, the question remains as to how different tenure systems may most effectively complement eachother. This paper argues that the debate needs to give {{more attention to the}} local dynamics and politicsof tenure reform, and how reforms are locally renegotiated as part of local institutional competition. Itreflects on the case of Uganda, where legislation and policies over the last 15 years have promoted formal-izing land titles and modernizing land law in combination with recognizing customary ownership andland governance. Fieldwork in Mbarara District in South-western Uganda shows that, although reformsdelay, they increase institutional multiplicity and fuel contestation among local authorities and aboutthe norms applied. Rather than strengthening local mechanisms to make small customary landownersmore tenure secure, renegotiating of the reforms results in delegitimizing customary authorities and <b>thereforms</b> do not succeed in ‘modernizing’ the customary rules and conventions applied. Moreover, reformsfail to generate confidence in both statutory and customary land governing authorities as protectors ofsmallholders’ claims to land...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of Spain’s {{membership of the}} European Union are not wellreflected in the Constitution. The Autonomous Communities are not mentionedin article 93 of the Constitution, which refers explicitly to Europeanaffairs. The aim {{of this article is}} to examine, in current practice, two of the Europeanissues arising from Spanish membership that are of concern to the AutonomousCommunities, insofar as their political autonomy is significantly affected. Thefirst is the locus standi of the Autonomous Communities in terms of the jurisdictionalinstitutions of the European Union, since they cannot defend theirpowers judicially when affected by an EU regulation as easily as the centralpowers of the State can. This is because they have no legitimate status as partiesin the European appeal process, which in turn makes it very difficult forthem to take issue with measures which are not aimed at them. The otherissue is the responsibility of the Autonomous Communities for non-compliance with EU law at internal level, because it is they who have to deal withthe consequences arising this such non-compliance. The final section considers how these two areas have been regulated in <b>thereforms</b> to the statutes of the Autonomous Communities which are either inforce or in the process of being enacted. Particular reference is made to theCatalan case, in order to determine how far the provisions of the statutescorrespond to the legal regime and practice followed in these two areas...|$|R
40|$|With the Tanzimat era (1839) in Ottoman period, {{the system}} ofeducation which was running in {{religious}} axis, began to includedifferent disciplines that corresponded practical needs {{of daily life}} andhandled secular subjects. Sports and courses that necessitate manipulative skills began {{to take place in}} the programs with thecomprehension that people should also progress physically andspiritually. First of all, music courses that are known with the term„‟Gına‟‟ have an important place among these courses. The first samplesof music courses can be accepted as some „‟ Girls‟ High Schools,Teacher Schools for girls (Darülmuallimat) since 1870 s, „‟Mekatib-iİptidaiye Course Curriculum, prepared in 1914, the sample primaryschools known as „‟Numune Mekatib-i‟‟ of the time and the musiccourses in the infant schools whose opening was adjudged with the lawof Tedrisat-ı İptidaiye that was put into action in 1913. The music courses that we began to learn espacially in the finalstage education programs of Ottoman Empire were expressed by theword “Gına” in the beginning. “Gına” meant “to sing”. Although there isnot much knowledge that is based on document, it is expressed thatmainly hymns and various pieces that tells the flatters to the king wereperformed in these courses. With the innovation movement in education that began with <b>thereforms,</b> we see that education programs have been glamourized withan understanding which appeals to the needs of daily life, which putsthe individual more in the center and which aims to improve thespiritual side of humanbeings mainly with the artistic courses. Thereflection of this understanding on the music courses includes aninevitable but a hard development process. In this parallel, the musiccourses that were defined as „”Gına” {{at the beginning of the}} process,have continued to take their places in the programs by being defined as“Musiki” afterwards. The reflection of innovation movements on the education hascaused a more systematic pedagogic formation understanding that isbased on the opinions of European educators and the preparation of amore appropriate education programs as parallel to the former. In thisperiod when the wars, the pressure of wars, the loss of ground and thepoverty were dense, independence, freedom, the love of nation and othernotions like these were taught to the children with the educationpractices that began to innovate, and these notions became the drivingpower in winning the war and in the establishment of the new country. While the innovation movements in the education system have causedthe addition of courses that are about daily life and practical life apartfrom religious courses and while causing the addition of Gına (Musiki) courses in the programs on one hand, the foundation of seculareducation systems has been laid on the other. The Era of Administrative Reforms has found a correspondancefor itself in the social base as well, in connection with the childeducation of this period, many literary and artistic works for childrenhave been produced and many studies have been made about teachingmusic among these works. That the music courses have begun to take place in the educationprograms has brought about the needs for musical documents that arenecessarry for the music courses and the first “school music” bookshave begun to be produced. As the education programs cannot bethought separate from the social structure in which it was formed, someof the children songs in the piece that was studied, particularly reflects the sense, feelings and the needs of the period. In the children songsthat are in the piece, variety of subjects is given and the subjects havebeen chosen by the fact that they reflect the feelings and the needs ofthe society. Among the music course books that are used in music courses,Zati (Arca) Bey‟s work named Talim-i Kıraat-i Musiki is accepted as thefirst book in the field of school music. Pedagogically, the book hasguided to the books of music education which were produced in therepublican period. The subjects in the children‟s songs which took placein the book that was first written in the year 1899 and whose 1925 edition was analysed in this research has shown the emotions, ideas,feelings and the needs of Turkish people of that time. The great agonyresulted from the loss of the cities, the virtue of helping materially to thearmy that was struggling, the honour of Turkishness and the war ofindependence, and the importance of agricultural progress, productionand being economical are the main topics dealt with in the songs thatare in this book. The subjects that are dealt with in the songs that takeplace in the book are as follows: “Games, organs, days, numbers,seasons, the awareness of economy, the importance of studying, thelove of God, nutrition, the love of nature, the love of father & mother,the importance of education, longing, heroism and love of country. ”When compared to the studies that are about the variety ofsubjects in the songs that were written in the advancing years of theRepublican period, we see that the subjects of the songs that take placein the piece named „‟Talim-i Kıraat-i Musiki‟‟ reflect a real pedagogicunderstanding and we also see that with its this characteristic, itpioneers to the similar music education books that are written after it. Osmanlı Döneminde Tanzimat‟la birlikte (1839), o zamana kadardini eksende işleyen eğitim sistemi, artık dünyevi konuları ele alan,günlük hayatın pratik ihtiyaçlarına cevap veren farklı disiplinleri dekapsamaya başlamıştır.
