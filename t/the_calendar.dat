5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of <b>the</b> <b>Calendar</b> Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in <b>the</b> <b>calendar,</b> specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused <b>the</b> <b>calendar</b> to become neglected. <b>The</b> <b>calendar</b> required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the misalignment of <b>the</b> <b>calendar,</b> an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E
25|$|To the {{objection}} that <b>the</b> new <b>calendar</b> has created problems by adjusting only <b>the</b> fixed <b>calendar,</b> while leaving {{all of the}} commemorations in the moveable cycle on <b>the</b> original Julian <b>calendar,</b> <b>the</b> obvious answer, of course, is that the 1923 Synod, which adopted <b>the</b> new <b>calendar,</b> did in fact change <b>the</b> moveable <b>calendar</b> as well, and that calendar problems introduced {{as a result of}} the adoption of <b>the</b> (fixed) new <b>calendar</b> alone, would not have existed had the corrections to <b>the</b> moveable <b>calendar</b> also been implemented.|$|R
2500|$|Eastern Christianity bases its {{calculations}} on <b>the</b> Julian <b>Calendar.</b> Because of <b>the</b> 13-day {{difference between}} <b>the</b> <b>calendars</b> between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>Calendar.</b> Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May on <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>calendar</b> (<b>the</b> Julian <b>calendar</b> {{is no longer}} used as <b>the</b> civil <b>calendar</b> of <b>the</b> countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate).
