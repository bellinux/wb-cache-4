5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
25|$|Detection {{of crimes}} was much {{improved}} when Edward Henry, the Commissioner from 1903–18, {{set up a}} Fingerprint Bureau at Scotland Yard in 1901. A landmark case for the Met in forensic investigation was the Stratton Brothers case of 1905, concerning a double murder in Deptford, committed by Alfred and Albert Stratton, in which, for the first time, fingerprint evidence secured the conviction. Another important investigation of this period was <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen in 1910.|$|E

25|$|The formal Board of Trade {{investigation}} into the sinking was presided over by Wreck Commissioner Lord Mersey and {{took place in the}} Westminster Central Hall from 15–18 June 1915 with further sessions at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 1 July and Caxton Hall on 17 July. Lord Mersey had a background in commercial rather than maritime law but had presided over a number of important maritime investigations, including <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> loss of the Titanic. He was assisted by four assessors, Admiral Sir Frederick Samuel Inglefield, Lieutenant Commander Hearn and two merchant navy captains, D. Davies and J. Spedding. The Attorney General, Sir Edward Carson, represented the Board of Trade, assisted by the Solicitor General, F. E. Smith. Butler Aspinall, who had previously represented the Board of Trade at the Titanic inquiry, was retained to represent Cunard. A total of 36 witnesses were called, Lord Mersey querying why more of the survivors would not be giving evidence. Most of the sessions were public but two on 15 and 18 June were held in camera when evidence regarding navigation of the ship was presented.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{new discoveries}} and {{theories}} {{in the field}} of paleontology, the portrayal of several dinosaurs differed from that of the previous films. Discoveries suggesting that Velociraptor were feathered prompted the addition of quill-like structures on the head and neck of the males in the film. [...] "We've found evidence that Velociraptors had feathers, or feather-like structures, and we've incorporated <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new look of the raptor", said paleontologist Jack Horner, the film's technical adviser.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} have one person fully {{understand}} and develop their own character, as well as later be able to impart that to the crew, the film's directors and producers decided to have character leads and supervising animators on specific characters. First-time character lead Becky Bresee serves as the supervising animator for Anna. She described her job as [...] "making the character more believable". To achieve this, she had to act out part of a sequence in the movie between Anna and Kristoff {{for a number of}} times, each of them emphasizing the character's gestures differently. [...] "Anna's a little bit nervous and uncomfortable, and I {{had to find a way}} to put <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> animation," [...] explained Bresee.|$|E

The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer." [...] Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is [...] "a single-player studio".|$|E
500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. [...] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had {{included}} the Quidditch subplot {{would have been a}} lesser film", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, we tried to get <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been [...] "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".|$|E
500|$|New Media {{consultants}} and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided {{in the production}} of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E

Suitable for readers age ten {{to one hundred}} and ten, Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha #1: Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere". Its sequel, Escape from the Forest, was also well reviewed: a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his [...] "growing violence". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that [...] "Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing each moment of fear, anxiety, contentment and joy. The cat's-eye perspective {{of many of the}} panels, in addition, add [...] a dramatic, energizing element to the book". The reviewer also wrote that [...] "a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha's saga", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world. Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that [...] "though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style".|$|E

Stewart top-scored with 78, and all the specialist batsmen made starts.

Fontana replied, [...] "In answer to your question, NO — there were no homosexual double-entendres in the script — at least none that were deliberate. If some viewers chose to read <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of-control situation. It also was a peek into the Vulcan culture {{that no one had}} seen before. That's ALL we were doing. I've heard this nonsense (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it.

2500|$|Kevin Boyle's exhaustively {{researched}} and lucidly written study of post-World War II labor liberalism {{is a major}} contribution to labor and political history. Highlighting the social democratic perspective of UAW president Walter Reuther, it challenges the prevailing view among labor historians that the ouster of pro-Soviet unions from the CIO in 1949 and 1950 sent organized labor into an irremediable tailspin. ... he insists <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1960s the Reuther-led Auto Workers remained a vigorous and principled advocate of structural change in the political economy. Indeed, Boyle sees the mid-1960s rather than the immediate postwar years as the period of social democracy's greatest promise and accomplishment. The book also describes and analyzes {{the impact of the}} Vietnam War on the United Automobile Workers. [...] Boyle concludes that the union was not nearly as hawkish as most observers have concluded, and that fierce fights were waged within the AFL-CIO over support for the war.|$|E
2500|$|The {{team had}} two effects with {{vehicles}} {{that did not}} perform as originally planned. The first, in [...] "Rush", involved a scene where Pete and Chloe intentionally drive their car off a cliff and Clark speeds in to catch it before it hits the ground. To attain the shot of Clark catching Pete’s car required the crew to suspend the car from a crane with Sam Jones III and Allison Mack inside the car. The scene was filmed in a rock quarry, as {{there are not many}} cliffs in the Vancouver area, with segments of the scene created digitally. The car was then filmed as it was being pulled into the air backwards—the footage was then reverse {{to give the impression that}} it was falling. Initially, Mike Walls and his crew tried to pull the car straight up, but it was not working. The movement of the car had to be tweaked to give a sense of reality. In the season finale, Jonathan and Martha crash their truck on their way home after an EMP blast, which Clark caused, sends a shock wave out that downs a telephone pole and their truck hits it. In order to get the Kent truck to roll for the moment where Jonathan and Martha encounter the wave of EMP, two stunt drivers drove the truck toward a collapsed telephone pole, skidding into it. Then, with mannequins in the truck for safety, the effects team wrapped some cables around the truck and launched it off a ratchet to make it roll. Unfortunately, this did not go as smoothly as planned the first time, as the telephone pole did not fall when they set off the explosive charge to break it. Since it would be too hard to strap John Schneider and Annette O'Toole into the truck while it is upside down, and too dangerous to flip the truck with them already in it, Mike Walls and his team built a rotating truck seat, which allowed them to strap Schneider and O’Toole in, then rotate the seat so that they are upside down and slide <b>that</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> overturned truck.|$|E
