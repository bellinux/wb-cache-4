Unlike the bottom up approaches reported thus far, the approach described in this paper {{is similar to the}} way a <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> would be constructed in a CAD system. The underlying four sided patch is first identified and constructed from the point data and then trimmed with the boundary curves to obtain the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> patch.

40|$|In {{the shape}} {{modeling}} with 3 D CAD systems, the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> is quite popular. For instance, Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) models contain {{a lot of}} notches, expressed using trimmed surfaces. Since trimmed surfaces are directly modified in direct modeling, it has a big restriction in the shape modification. It is effective to apply a new free-form surface to a closed region composed of the modified edges because the consistency of a <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> can be maintained. This paper proposes the method of fitting a free-form surface by using the offset curve. To be more concrete, an offset curve is generated according to the tangent planes and a point cloud is generated. After that, a B-spline surface is generated using the generated point clouds and the boundary curves, so that a new <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> is generated. Our method is effective for direct modeling that directly modifies the boundary edges of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> representing a notch shape...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{methodology}} for trimming 3 D solid finite element meshes using a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces representation. The algorithms applied {{in the identification of}} the spatial position of the finite element (FE) nodes and elements relative to the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface</b> are described, as well as, the explanation of the correction methods adopted to geometrically rearrange the trimmed elements. Three different strategies are proposed to adjust, with greater or lesser accuracy, the trimmed FE mesh to the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface.</b> The first consists only of an element elimination strategy, while the other two are based on a nodal stretching strategy, aiming for more accurate adjustment of the finite elements boundary to the <b>trimming</b> <b>surface.</b> Finally, to highlight the capabilities of the developed program, a mesh generation example is given by trimming a mesh with the shape of a blank automotive panel.

40|$|In {{the process}} of CAD/CAM, {{predefined}} parametric surfaces are often subject to the operation of trimming or extending. In such a case, the original iso-parametric curves are no longer boundary-conformed. Consequently, they are not anymore suitable for being used as natural CNC toolpaths. In this paper a method to regenerate boundary-conformed iso-parametric toolpaths on altered free-form surfaces is presented. The main idea of this method is to fit the 2 D parametric domain of the given <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> with a 2 D Coons patch. Then boundary-conformed toolpaths on the altered surface can be regenerated naturally via the iso-parametric curves of the Coons patch via a two-step mapping. The application of this method is successfully illustrated on a typical <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface,</b> a turbine blade. The applicability and limitations of this method are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Geometric {{modeling}} of complex objects {{is a difficult}} task. Free-form deformation (FFD) is {{a powerful tool for}} modeling complex objects. However, using FFD is sometimes difficult. In this thesis, FFD for parametric trimmed surfaces is presented. This method uses NURBS FFD to modify the shape of parametric trimmed surfaces. A feature-based FFD method is presented for 3 D Garment CAD application. <b>Trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> development is primarily used for flattening a 3 D surface into a corresponding 2 D pattern or surface. This thesis presents a general method for parametric <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> development. This method can be applied in computer aided design, texture mapping, ship building, etc. First, the surface is triangulated and mapped onto a plane. This initial planar mapping has the same topology as its original surface. Then, a spring-mass system is applied to deform the initial planar mapping. The resulting surface elastic deformation energy distribution is indicated by a color graph, which determines a surface cutting line. The method presented in this thesis can efficiently solve development problems for complex trimmed surfaces. Accuracy of a developed surface can easily be controlled locally. Thus, compared to earlier methods, this method provides more flexibility for solving CAD and CAM surface problems. As a prior step to surface free-form deformation and surface development, an improved <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> triangulation method is also presented. The algorithm first constructs triangles in parametric space, then adjusts the shapes of triangles in model space. As a result, the algorithm guarantees a good triangular mesh in model space...|$|E
40|$|Topologically {{consistent}} algorithms for {{the intersection}} and trimming of free-form parametric surfaces are of fundamental importance in computer-aided design, analysis, and manufacturing. Since {{the intersection of}} (for example) two bicubic tensor-product surface patches is not a rational curve, it is usually described by approximations in the parameter domain of each surface. If these approximations are employed as “trim curves”, their images in R 3 do not agree precisely, and the resulting <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> may exhibit “gaps ” and “overlaps ” along their common edge, an artifact that often incurs failure of downstream applications. We present a direct and simple approach to the problem, wherein the intersection curve is described explicitly by the sides of a sequence of triangular Bézier patches. Instead of representing <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> by <b>trim</b> curves in the surface parameter domain, together with appropriate control point perturbations to guarantee consistency, we use triangular patches to directly approximate the intersection curve and the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> it defines. The triangular patches are constructed so as to maintain smooth (i. e., tangent-plane continuous) connections to untrimmed patches of the original surface. We assume that the original intersecting surfaces are subject t...|$|R

40|$|A new spiral {{tool path}} {{generation}} algorithm for 5 -axis high speed machining is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the voltage contours are calculated {{to satisfy the}} machining parameters in the mapping parametric domain {{by means of the}} electrostatic field model of partial differential equations. Secondly, the mapping rules are constructed and the machining trajectory is planned out in the standard parametric domain in order to map and generate the spiral trajectory in the corresponding parametric domain. Finally, this trajectory is mapped onto the parametric surface for the obtainment of the spiral tool path. This spiral tool path can realize the machining of complicated parametric surface and <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> without tool retractions. The above-mentioned algorithm has been implemented in several simulations and validated successfully through the actual machining of a complicated cavity. The results indicate that this method is superior to the existing machining methods to realize the high speed machining of the complicate-shaped cavity based on parametric surface and <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface.</b> This research was supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (973 Program) under Grant No. 2011 CB 302400 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant Nos. 50975274 and 51175479...|$|E

30|$|Since the {{numerical}} integration of <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> and along common edges {{is not a}} trivial task, it can be useful to outsource this task into a separate specialized library the CAD-Geometry Utilities and to hand over just the required data for the IBRA element formulations.

40|$|Most {{existing}} meshing algorithms for a 2 D or shell figure {{requires the}} figure to have exactly four sides. Generating structured grids in the n-sided parametric region of a <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> thus usually requires to first partition the region into four-sided sub-regions. We address the automatic structured grid generation problem in an n-sided region by fitting a planar Gregory patch {{so that the}} partition requirement is naturally avoided. However, self-overlapping may occur in some portions of the algebraically generated Grid: this severely limits its usage in most of engineering and scientific applications where a grid system with no self-intersecting is strictly required. To solve the problem, we use a functional optimization approach to move grid nodes in the u-v domain of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> to eliminate the self-overlapping. The derivatives of a Gregory patch, which are extremely difficult to compute analytically, are not required in our method. Thus, our optimization algorithm compares favourably {{at least in terms}} of speed with some other mesh optimization algorithms, such as the elliptic PDE method. In addition, to overcome the difficulty of guessing a good initial position of every grid node for the conjugate gradient method, a progressive optimization algorithm is incorporated in our optimization. Experiment results are given to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the presented method. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Using a Coons patch mapping to {{generate}} a structured grid in the parametric region of a <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> can avoid the singularity of elliptic PDE methods when only C- 1 continuous boundary is given; the error of converting generic parametric C- 1 boundary curves into a specified representation form is also avoided. However, overlap may happen on some portions of the algebraically generated grid when a linear or native cubic blending function {{is used in the}} mapping; this severely limits its usage in most of engineering and scientific applications where a grid system of non-self-overlapping is strictly required. To solve the problem, non-trivial blending functions in a Coons patch mapping should be determined adaptively by the given boundary so that self-overlapping can be averted. We address the adaptive determination problem by a functional optimization method. The governing equation of the optimization is derived by adding a virtual dimension in the parametric space of the given <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface.</b> Both one- and two-parameter blending functions are studied. To resolve the difficulty of guessing good initial blending functions for the conjugate gradient method used, a progressive optimization algorithm is then proposed which {{has been shown to be}} very effective in a variety of practical examples. Also, an extension is added to the objective function to control the element shape. Finally, experiment results are shown to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the presented method.

40|$|Generating optimal NC code {{to drive}} milling {{machines}} for models defined by freeform <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is a difficult}} problem. In practice, Two main approaches are used to generate toolpaths for surfaces, neither of which is optimal, in general. The first exploits the parametric representation and generates isocurves that are uniformly distributed across the parametric domain. This approach is not optimal if the surface mapping into Euclidean space is not isometric. The second approach contours the models by intersecting the surfaces with planes equally spaced in Euclidean space, resulting in a piecewise linear toolpath approximation which is nonadaptive to the local surface geometry. Furthermore, the toolpath generated by contouring is suitable for 3 axis milling but is inappropriate for 5 axis milling.
