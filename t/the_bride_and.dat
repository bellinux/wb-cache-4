5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> <b>and</b> they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} the {{marriage}} songs is mostly related to the selection of groom and the girl's wishes regarding it.

5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> groom (including the {{speaking of the}} name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage. More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown {{seated on the}} ground in the {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> groom go around the fire seven times.|$|E
50|$|The {{first meeting}} usually takes place between <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> groom, <b>and</b> their {{respective}} mothers.

Nowadays, the man might suggest to his family who he would like them to consider, and it may be that the man and the woman already know each other. It is also nowadays common in urban families for a <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> groom to agree to marry before the groom approaches <b>the</b> <b>bride's</b> family for their permission.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{long list}} of {{preparations}} usually awaits soon-to-be <b>brides</b> <b>and</b> grooms before their auspicious wedding ceremony. The most common hassles <b>the</b> <b>brides</b> <b>and</b> grooms face includes registration of marriage, wedding photographs, location for the occasion, dinner ceremony, guest lists, seat placements and the list goes on. Without guidance <b>and</b> recommendations, these <b>brides</b> <b>and</b> grooms face <b>the</b> unpleasantness of hunting for the suitable bridal products and services. The ideal world for any couple {{is to be able}} to retrieve information on the available products and services, such as types of services and price lists, in the shortest possible time. However, the ideal world is a very lowly part of reality. A web based wedding planner that lessens the hassles and progressively shortened the time consuming process is a step towards the ideal world. It would be desirable if <b>the</b> <b>brides</b> <b>and</b> grooms are able to acquire the information online or within the same location and subscribe to a service that is able to assist them in the preparations. Wedding Arch is a web based comparative analysis decision support system that assists <b>the</b> <b>brides</b> <b>and</b> grooms in <b>the</b> process of planning their wedding.

5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E
5|$|Weeks {{after his}} {{successful}} tour of England, Ganguly eloped with childhood sweetheart Dona Roy. <b>The</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> groom's family were sworn enemies {{at that point}} and this news caused an uproar between them.

Later that year, he won four consecutive man of the match awards, in the Sahara Cup with Pakistan; the second of these was won after he took five wickets for 16 runs off 10 overs, his best bowling in an ODI.

5|$|Konkani {{pop music}} became popular after Indian Independence in 1947. Henry D'Souza and Helen D'Cruz {{are known for}} the Konkani love duet Kathrina in 1971 and the love Ballad Garacho Divo (Lamp of the House) in the 1970s, while Wilfy Rebimbus' sonnet Mog Tuzo Kithlo Axelom (How I Have Loved Thee) from 1977 is popular. Konkani plays, {{especially}} religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro. The Ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has {{the form of an}} earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some wild animal, and the other is left open. The traditional theatre form is called Gumat, and is performed {{on the eve of the}} marriage or in connection with the marriage celebrations in the decorated pandal (stage). The play is conducted by males belonging to both the brides' and bridegrooms' parties, and usually takes place for two or three nights. The plays performed are usually those of Biblical stories, and their morals are presented with the purpose of educating <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> <b>and</b> bridegroom. This tradition has almost completely died out among the present generation.|$|E
