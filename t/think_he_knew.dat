500|$|During his monologue, host Rock joked, [...] "Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|On race day, {{the track}} was fast, {{and the weather}} was warm and sunny. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him. The two ran the first quarter in a quick :23 and the next quarter in a swift :22, {{completing}} the fastest opening half mile {{in the history of}} the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte said, [...] "This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he was going [...] miles, I never pushed him." [...] In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost [...] of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was devastated}} by the trial results, later saying, [...] "It was the most empty feeling in the world." [...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the pain I was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling, because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I believe there is a God who created this, and it ain't no accident. [...] He's got a plan... maybe it just wasn't the right thing for you." [...] Soon after, Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville. After several [...] "really tough conversions" [...] with Banister, Tarwater decided to [...] " [...] life to Christ and basically relinquished control." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1941, deHavilland was {{reunited with}} Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh's epic They Died with Their Boots On. The film is {{loosely based on}} the {{courtship}} and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth [...] "Libbie" [...] Bacon. Flynn and deHavilland had a falling out the previous yearmainly over the roles she was being givenand she {{did not intend to}} work with him again. Even Flynn acknowledged, [...] "She was sick to death of playing 'the girl' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress." [...] After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, deHavilland accepted. Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes, and improve the overall dialogue. The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together. Their last appearance on screen is Custer's farewell to his wife. [...] "Errol was quite sensitive," [...] deHavilland would later remember, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it would be the last time we worked together." [...] Flynn's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: [...] "Walking through life with you, ma'am, has been a very gracious thing." [...] They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film's historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting. Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found deHavilland [...] "altogether captivating". The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (...) , Warner Bros' second-biggest money-maker of that year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in CounterPunch, author Tariq Ali said, [...] "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what he was saying and why. In a neo-liberal world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of Mike Davis), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith. The reaction in the Muslim world was predictable, but depressingly insufficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her name {{appeared}} {{extensively in}} the international press following the murder of Terre'Blanche on 3 April 2010. In {{an exclusive interview with}} the Daily Mail she revealed [...] "I suppose at some level I always thought he would come to a very violent end. He lived a violent existence and I knew he wasn't going to die peacefully in bed. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it too." [...] She also told the newspaper that she believed his murder was politically orchestrated. In 2012, Terre'Blanche's widow, Martie denied allegations of an affair between her late husband and Allan. Allan also reasserted that she believed affair allegations were orchestrated by South African intelligence services. Despite defending affair claims she made, Linda Shaw also agreed with Allan's assertion that intelligence services used the story to discredit Terre'Blanche and the far-right movement.|$|E
