The operational vibration of diesel <b>electric</b> <b>generator</b> influences building cost, efficiency, performance and effectiveness. Building mechanical power and plumbing system contribute to building noise and vibration, which affect building occupant, sensitive installation and functional use. This paper review the {{theoretical and practical}} aspect associated with one particular vibration control technology, namely passive vibration isolation. It discusses the selection of elastomeric isolator for single degree freedom of diesel <b>electric</b> <b>generator</b> assembly by using MAT LAB...|$|R

40|$|Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) can {{be applied}} to {{investigate}} complex infrastructure interdependencies including those between the electric power and natural gas markets. The electric power and natural gas markets are undergoing fundamental transformations. These transformations include major changes in <b>electric</b> <b>generator</b> fuel sources. <b>Electric</b> <b>generators</b> that use natural gas as a fuel source are rapidly gaining market share. <b>Electric</b> <b>generators</b> using natural gas introduce direct interdependency between the electric power and natural gas markets. The interdependencies between the electric power and natural gas markets introduced by these generators can be investigated using the emergent behavior of CAS model agents...|$|R

Wind <b>electric</b> <b>generators</b> in this range are not commercially available in this country at present. The paper describes a wind <b>electric</b> <b>generator</b> designed in the Laboratory for this purpose.
