5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone clarinet, with <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> bores of {{slightly}} different lengths whose tone holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and a valve to switch from one bore to the other.|$|E
5|$|In Saginaw, the <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> streets {{continue}} {{east and}} meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{through the}} village has been so heavy on {{weekends}} during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one-way, carrying traffic only to the west, while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> streets.

5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|For the {{introduction}} of London Underground services, the original station was completely demolished and rebuilt. The station was provided with two additional platforms, giving four in total. The platforms comprise <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> islands with tracks on both sides. This was necessary as {{the intention of the}} Northern Heights project was that trains would be able to run south from East Finchley to Highgate via both the surface and the underground routes. The inner pair of tracks served the surface route, whilst the outer pair serve the tunnel route.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> routes: {{cell-free}} spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> generations of Commodores {{until the new}} station wagon and utility body styles were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore wheelbase instead of the extended wheelbase of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Khrushchev divided oblast (province) level Party {{committees}} into <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> structures, one {{for industry}} {{and one for}} agriculture. This was unpopular among Party apparatchiks, and led to confusions {{in the chain of}} command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each oblast, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system. Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.|$|E

5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. <b>Two</b> <b>parallel</b> rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E
5|$|More {{numerous}} than new-build forts {{were old}} forts upgraded to higher defensive specifications. Thus the <b>two</b> <b>parallel</b> ditches common around earlier forts could {{be joined by}} excavating the ground between them. Projecting towers were added. Gates were either rebuilt with projecting towers or sealed off by constructing a large rectangular bastion. The walls were strengthened by doubling the old thickness. Upgraded forts were generally much larger than new-build. New forts were rarely over one hectare in size and were normally placed to fill gaps between old forts and towns. However, {{not all of the}} old forts that continued {{to be used in the}} 4th century were upgraded e.g. the forts on Hadrian's Wall and some other forts in Britannia were not significantly modified.|$|E
