5|$|Because Jacob {{mentioned}} {{hearing a}} plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an FBI agent, Neil Baxter, {{in a search for}} the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a handgun from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities. Jacob however announces that {{he does not want to}} live with <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> memories; he threatens to shoot himself to end it. He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.|$|E

25|$|From 1986 until 2003, Amtrak {{managed the}} {{entirety}} of Boston's commuter rail. It did decently, though at times had strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, numbers of conductors per train, and who took responsibility when trains are late. Because of <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> relations and Amtrak's repeated announcements that the contract was unreasonable, few people were surprised at Amtrak's decision not to bid again for the commuter rail contract when it came up for renewal in 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Mars Volta wrote their album Bedlam in Goliath (2008) {{based on}} their alleged {{experiences}} with a Ouija board. According to their story (written for them by a fiction author, Jeremy Robert Johnson), Omar Rodriguez Lopez purchased one while traveling in Jerusalem. At first the board provided a story which became the theme for the album. Strange events allegedly related to this activity occurred during the recording of the album: the studio flooded, one of the album's main engineers had a nervous breakdown, equipment began to malfunction, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala's foot was injured. Following <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> experiences the band buried the Ouija board.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Buenaventura became central bank governor, over fifteen {{percent of the}} total loan {{portfolio}} of the entire banking sector was considered non-performing loans. Within the next year, this peaked at seventeen percent. The need to unload <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> loans before they collapsed the industry spurred the BSP-led lobby for the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, a law that would allow banks to sell their bad loans at a discount to companies that specialized in taking over bad loans and turning them around. Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E
25|$|Dressed up as a stereotypical nerd in his basement, the Nerd {{reviews the}} game with his {{trademark}} eyeglasses and white collared shirt with a pocket full of pens, high khaki pants and white socks and loafers, while sometimes being bombarded by guest characters from video games and popular culture as well. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games, mock the Nerd's anguish, and act as parodies of the characters from {{which they had been}} derived. In response to them and to the games, the Nerd derives comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios, anger, and consumption of Rolling Rock (in addition to Yuengling in later videos) while reviewing video games. His anger and profanity over <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> games would sometimes climax in him destroying whole game cartridges, simulating defacation on, burning, and sometimes even crushing entire video game consoles.|$|E

40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the “global public goods ” generated by foreign interventions. Global public goods have traditional public good characteristics, but their benefits extend across societies and regions. We analyze how well-intentioned foreign interventions to provide global public goods can also result in global public <b>bads.</b> <b>These</b> <b>bads</b> emerge through the dynamics of unintended consequences resulting from knowledge constraints on policymakers designing interventions. Case studies of foreign interventions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Pakistan are provided as evidence. The main conclusion is one of humility regarding foreign interventions to provide global public goods...|$|R

500|$|As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a {{by-product}} of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's bad decisions, and Lex's [...] "basest instincts" [...] that make Lana the [...] "receptacle of all of <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> decisions", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a [...] "wimpy, whiny kind of girl"; with Lex, Lana is [...] "strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? What does he think? Does he love me? I don't know where I stand.'" [...] To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness {{that had not been}} seen in the character. This is evident in [...] "Nemesis" [...] when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the underground tunnels. As Gough explains, {{by the end of the}} sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games.|$|E

Gelu Ionescu thus notes that the text on patriotism was circumstantial and not, like some by his fellow writers, [...] "a homage to Nicolae Ceauşescu." [...] Călinescu also noted (emphasis in the original): [...] "the bad things [...] caused by giving in reflected only on himself (he never signed any deal with the devil; he never, and in no way, implicated anyone else into anything) and [...] <b>these</b> <b>bad</b> things were not irreparable." ...|$|E
