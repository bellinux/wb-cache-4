5|$|On several occasions, the M3 {{was mounted}} on PT boats to {{increase}} their firepower. One of these boats was John F. Kennedy's PT-109. The gun with its wheels removed was mounted on wooden planks nailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were {{fitted in}} two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> below the {{platform}} for the 4-inch guns. Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. Sydney was fitted with a single depth charge rail at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns. These were removed during the August 1940 refit.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Roksan {{introduced}} the Artaxerxes phono stage – a moving coil phono pre-amplifier designed to sit inside the turntable. Roksan also marketed a three-legged table dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> In 1987 Roksan launched the Shiraz moving coil phono cartridge. In 1989, Roksan launched the budget Radius record player, Tabriz arm and Corus moving magnet cartridge.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Manahawkin Bay Bridge was {{dedicated}} the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge {{in honor of}} Dorland J. Henderson, {{who was one of}} NJDOT’s top engineers that designed the lighting system for the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This project, completed in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge is to undergo a rehabilitation project and a parallel bridge will be built to the south. Construction began on May 3, 2013 with completion expected in 2019.|$|E

50|$|As a funny aside, a usual prank {{goes like}} this: the pie, the dealer, might be talking and {{laughing}} while shuffling <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> Then he might put the cards down beside the mano, <b>the</b> player <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right of the pie. The mano might think he is <b>the</b> one <b>to</b> cut <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> because <b>the</b> pie gave him the cards, but in fact, he is not <b>the</b> one <b>to</b> cut <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> When <b>the</b> mano then reaches towards the cards, the pie will hit his hand as a punishment for being tricked into thinking he was <b>the</b> one <b>to</b> cut <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> This of course {{has no effect on}} gameplay.|$|R
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> or quayside.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E

5|$|At 03:13, U-156 {{attacked}} the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach {{next to the}} Arend/Eagle Refinery. Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties. Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men to take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel, so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire, the gun blew up. Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> Before the sailor could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{between the}} ships was fiercely contested, but the {{smaller and more}} lightly armed Boston seemed to be taking the more serious damage when at 6:20 Captain Courtenay was thrown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> What happened next has been subject to debate, with the second-in-command, Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time. However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him, a story that his family credited and was later {{taken up by the}} contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton, although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards' actions. With Courtenay gone, Boston continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07:00, when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape. Although Bompart pursued, by 08:00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back. After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River, Boston eventually escaped to St John's, Newfoundland while Embuscade refitted in New York.|$|E

50|$|A false cut is a move used {{either in}} magic, or for {{cheating}} when playing card games. It {{appears to be}} a real cut, but leaves <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> in <b>the</b> same order as when it began. More sophisticated versions may make specific desired changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck's</b> order, while still appearing to be an innocuous normal cut.|$|R
50|$|To load {{vehicles}} on <b>the</b> top <b>deck</b> of a double-decker commercial trailer, the rear half of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> can tilt and be lowered hydraulically, forming a drive-up ramp <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> top <b>deck</b> is usually loaded first and off-loaded last, since {{the presence of}} cars on <b>the</b> lower <b>deck</b> can make it impossible <b>to</b> lower <b>the</b> top <b>deck</b> ramp.|$|R
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. Cord and Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. They {{take care of the}} guards, and hear messages about problems with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only one}} minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E

Six crewmen attempted to launch the lifeboat but {{the magnitude of the}} list made this impossible. Those crew able to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> then gathered on the high starboard rail as the list continued to increase, until they all leapt into the water, followed shortly after by Captain Bell jumping from the bridge with capsize imminent. Within two minutes the Bombo had rolled over and sunk bow-first.|$|E
