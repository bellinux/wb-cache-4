5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

5|$|Christian Collett (1771–1833), a {{graduate}} of the Mining Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner Niels Aall. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central cupola, and a classical colonnade.

This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E

In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Several studies have attempted to explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
