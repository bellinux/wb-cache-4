5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within <b>that</b> <b>tree,</b> forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E

5|$|In recent times, local bodies {{such as the}} {{municipality}} of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the Catalan National Assembly, have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched pine tree or sapling {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the Castle of Gallifa in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a sapling of the Tree of Guernica). The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 presentation of a young tree to the town of Folgueroles, to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> has since been vandalised. Subsequent 2014 recipients have included Andorra la Vella, Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà, and Saldes. The Forest Museum in Sant Celoni also claims to have five descendants of Pi de les Tres Branques in its grounds.|$|E

25|$|Slash {{and burn}} agriculture, {{associated}} with lower populations than the Roman period, can {{be at least as}} responsible for deforestation and soil erosion as Roman agriculture. Coastal marshes can be caused by sea level changes quite as much as soil erosion.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} A-cordial graphs, for an {{abelian group}} A. (If A = Zk {{we call them}} k-cordial graphs.) These generalize harmonious, elegant, and cordial graphs. They also provide a graph-theoretic realization of the function υγ studied by Graham and Sloane (1980). We show <b>that</b> <b>trees</b> are 3, 4 and 5 -cordial and provide a finite (though long) test that, if passed, guarantees <b>that</b> all <b>trees</b> are A-cordial. We conjecture <b>that</b> <b>trees</b> are k-cordial for all k. We provide a partial classification of which cycles and complete graphs are k-cordial, and we show that for k even and &# 62; 4, most graphs are not k-cordial...|$|R

25|$|Oktar {{posits that}} it is God's mind that {{contains}} and captures all events within itself for all eternity, therefore, Oktar believes that no events or information are ever lost. According to Oktar, if a tree falls in a forest {{and there is no}} one there to hear it: <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> makes a sound, i.e. that event and occurrence is known to and captured by God, and that event remains at that point in time, and at that point in space for all eternity, preserved within God's book.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} classes of method for ancestral reconstruction. In chronological order of discovery, these are maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian Inference. Maximum parsimony considers all evolutionary events equally likely; maximum likelihood {{accounts for the}} differing likelihood of certain classes of event; and Bayeisan inference relates the conditional probability of an event to {{the likelihood of the}} tree, as well as the amount of uncertainty that is associated with <b>that</b> <b>tree.</b> Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood yield a single most probable outcome, whereas Bayesian inference accounts for uncertainties in the data and yields a sample of possible trees.|$|E
25|$|The Henninger Flats nursery {{was closed}} by the Forest Service in 1908 {{and moved to}} Lytle Creek. In a 'doleful' report written in 1912, the tree {{planting}} efforts on the national forest lands were deemed a failure by Assistant Chief of Silviculture T.D. Woodbury. The Forest Service's determined efforts to convert indigenous chaparral into forests fell short due to rabbits, rodents and a baking-hot sun and the project was eventually abandoned. Woodbury's report also suggested <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> planting become a research subject and recommended it be assigned to the newly established Feather River Experiment Station, located in the Plumas National Forest.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, it is {{also said}} that the Cruz de la Victoria was at first carved in an oak's log by a {{lightning}} strike. The core of this story contains two elements of major importance in the Asturian folklore: On one hand, lightning was the ancient symbol of the Astur god Taranis, and in Asturian mythology was thought to be forged by the Nuberu, lord of clouds, rain and wind. On the other hand, the oak tree is the symbol of the Asturian royalty and in reliefs of the Abamia Church (where Pelayo was buried) leaves of <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> are shown.|$|E
25|$|The {{representations}} in (a–d) are trees, {{whereby the}} specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are dependency edges and lightly dotted lines are projection lines. The {{only difference between}} tree (a) and tree (b) is <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels. Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order. The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by Word Grammar. The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words. Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.|$|E
25|$|Several {{contrary}} {{claims have}} been made against that the flight capabilities of Confuciusornis. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter's {{of the position of}} the shoulder joint, a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that {{due to the lack of}} a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the Musculus pectoralis minor could not serve as a M. supracoracoideus lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a foramen triosseum. This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that Confuciusornis used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel. Daniel Hembree however, while acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that Confuciusornis climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees Confuciusornis as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.|$|E

500|$|Ficus aurea is a {{strangler}} fig—it {{tends to}} establish {{on a host}} tree which it gradually encircles and [...] "strangles", eventually taking the place of <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> in the forest canopy. While this makes F. aurea an agent in the mortality of other trees, {{there is little to}} indicate that its choice of hosts is species specific. However, in dry forests on Great Exuma in The Bahamas, F. aurea establishes exclusively on palms, in spite of the presence of several other large trees that should provide suitable hosts. Eric Swagel and colleagues attributed this to the fact that humus accumulates on the leaf bases of these palms and provides a relatively moist microclimate in a dry environment, facilitating seedling survival.|$|E
500|$|Another {{instance}} of murder occurred on October 3, 1880, when Thomas Forrest stabbed Michael Carbis. Carbis, the foreman of the California mine, had fired Forrest {{the day before}} {{on account of his}} violent nature. The murder occurred near the Buckeye boarding house. Forrest initially had a pistol, but he put it away and drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of Carbis. Carbis died soon after the stab wound was inflicted. Silver Reef's residents were angered by the murder and soon lynch threats were delivered. Forrest, who had been arrested soon after the murder had been committed, was transferred to the jail in St. George for his own safety. Prior to the moving of Forrest, a lynch mob gathered and followed the sheriff's escort to the St. George jail. Once there, they overpowered the sheriff, took Forrest out of his cell, and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole. When the pole broke, they took him to a cottonwood tree and hung him there. The residents of St. George were shocked at the sight of Forrest's hanging, and one man was reputed to have said, [...] "I have observed <b>that</b> <b>tree</b> growing there for the last 25 years. This is the first time I have ever seen it bearing fruit." ...|$|E
