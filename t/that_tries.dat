5|$|Q*bert Rebooted {{contains}} a port {{of the classic}} arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, {{increasing the number of}} possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the 'Rebooted' mode features new enemy types, including a boxing glove that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round and have to be completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded with stars that enable access to more levels.|$|E
5|$|The Gun Court is {{the branch}} of the Jamaican {{judicial}} system <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> criminal cases involving firearms. The Court was established by Parliament in 1974 to combat rising gun violence, and empowered to try suspects in camera, without a jury. The Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and Resident Magistrate's Courts function as Gun Courts whenever they hear firearms cases. There is also a Western Regional Gun Court in Montego Bay. Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A Good Day to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Zane's {{signal leads}} Alan to a sawmill, {{but as he}} explores it, he finds himself back in a setting of his city apartment. Zane appears, and tells Alan that it is himself—the maniacal figure on the televisions—that is keeping him in the Dark Place. Alan refuses {{to believe that he}} is {{trapping}} himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.|$|E

25|$|Evidence-based {{practice}} is an approach <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> {{to specify the}} way in which professionals or other decision-makers should make decisions by identifying such evidence that there may be for a practice and rating it according to how scientifically sound it may be. Its goal is to eliminate unsound or excessively risky practices in favor of those that have better outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art {{is often}} {{utilized}} {{as a form}} of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Spain saw {{the release}} of the film All'Ombra Della Croce (A la Sombra de la Cruz) {{directed}} by the Italian filmmaker Alessandro Pugno. The film tells the secret story of the children of the chorus who sing every day in the mass. They live in a boarding school inside the monument and receive an education <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to resist the drift towards secularism and scientism of contemporary Spain and of global society. The film has been awarded with the first prize for the best documentary at Festival de Málaga de Cine Español.|$|E

25|$|The Grant's gazelle is a gregarious, territorial, and migratory species. The home {{ranges of}} does overlap {{with those of}} the bucks. Only male gazelles are territorial. Male gazelles will herd all females that cross their territories. When the females are in estrus, they are {{strongly}} guarded by the dominant male, which prevents other males from mating with them. Any doe <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to leave is aggressively herded back. Most of the time, the buck’s simple stance in relation to her is enough to keep the female from leaving.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{resource}} management is often solved by scalarization; that is, {{selection of a}} network utility function <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem. For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an NP-hard problem with a complexity that scales exponentially {{with the number of}} users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.|$|E
25|$|Classical morphology, {{continuum}} morphology, {{and process}} morphology are highly relevant to plant evolution, especially {{the field of}} plant evolutionary biology (plant evo-devo) <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to integrate plant morphology and plant molecular genetics. In a detailed case study on unusual morphologies, Rutishauser (2016) illustrated and discussed various topics of plant evo-devo such as the fuzziness (continuity) of morphological concepts, {{the lack of a}} one-to-one correspondence between structural categories and gene expression, the notion of morphospace, the adaptive value of bauplan features versus patio ludens, physiological adaptations, hopeful monsters and saltational evolution, the significance and limits of developmental robustness, etc.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to {{the stage of the}} emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion, some researchers have suggested that {{there is a difference between}} strategies <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.|$|R

25|$|Functional assays, i.e. an assay <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to {{quantify}} functioning {{of an active}} substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding exogenous formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) & VWF (usually endogenous).|$|E
25|$|In recent physics literature, a large {{majority}} of the electronic structures and band plots are calculated using density-functional theory (DFT), which is not a model but rather a theory, i.e., a microscopic first-principles theory of condensed matter physics <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to cope with the electron-electron many-body problem via the introduction of an exchange-correlation term in the functional of the electronic density. DFT-calculated bands are in many cases found to be in agreement with experimentally measured bands, for example by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In particular, the band shape is typically well reproduced by DFT. But there are also systematic errors in DFT bands when compared to experiment results. In particular, DFT seems to systematically underestimate by about 30-40% the band gap in insulators and semiconductors.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} {{schools of thought}} in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories {{are the result of}} generalizations from such observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position <b>that</b> <b>tries</b> to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.|$|E
