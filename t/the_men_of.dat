50|$|Superman: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> Tomorrow (MOT) is {{the title}} of a comic book series {{published}} by DC Comics that ran for 16 issues from 1995 to 1999, featuring the adventures of Superman.

5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> service units, themselves replaced by <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> the 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units {{was a matter of}} intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E
5|$|From the Second Age on, Quenya {{was also}} used ceremonially by <b>the</b> <b>Men</b> <b>of</b> Númenór and their {{descendants}} in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens; this practice was resumed by Aragorn {{when he took the}} crown as Elessar Telcontar.
