2500|$|Gary Moore {{created his}} own {{signature}} Les Paul {{in the early}} 2000s, characterised by a yellow flame top, no binding and signature <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover. It featured two open-topped humbucker pickups, one with [...] "zebra coils" [...] (one white and one black bobbin). In 2009, Gibson released another Gary Moore signature guitar, the Gibson Gary Moore BFG Les Paul. The Gary Moore BFG is much like their previous Les Paul BFG series, with the added styling of Moore's various 1950s Les Paul Standards.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson used {{hundreds}} {{of photographs of}} the late blues guitarist's instrument to produce the limited-edition Bloomfield signature. The company produced one hundred Bloomfield models with custom-aged finishes and two hundred more with the company's VOS finishing in 2009. They reproduced the tailpiece crack on the aged version, plus the mismatched volume and tone control knobs and the [...] "Les Paul"-engraved <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover on both versions, while including a toggle switch cover. The headstock was characterized by the kidney-shaped Grover tuning keys installed on the guitar before Bloomfield traded for it.|$|E
2500|$|Music Man's latest {{addition}} was the Bass Player Live Deluxe Classic Collection, {{which combines}} {{the elements of}} the first Music Man basses - such as a 2-band EQ, a chrome <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> wheel, vintage skinny fret-wire and nut, a chrome plated, hardened steel bridge plate with [...] "Classic" [...] stainless steel saddles and adjustable mute pads, as well as a 7.5" [...] radius urethane finished figured maple neck - with modern features such as a 6-bolt neck fixing and graphite acrylic resin coated body cavity and aluminum control cover. Models include the StingRay, StingRay 5 and Sterling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Truss</b> <b>rods</b> are {{frequently}} {{made out of}} steel, though graphite and other materials are sometimes used.|$|R
5000|$|Custom {{comes with}} a 34" [...] scale, two Seymour Duncan ASB4 Bassline pickups, a Seymour Duncan SCT3a active pre-amp, and two <b>truss</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Era: No top, 34" [...] scale, two <b>truss</b> <b>rods,</b> bolt on neck, Traben SB Combo pickups, double soapbar setup, and Traben T3 active pre-amp.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes {{developed}} a six-string {{version of the}} banjo, with the 6th string [...] "tunnelled" [...] through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor influenced development and perfection of the zither banjo and created the open-back banjo along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the modern non-solid attached resonator. (Gibson claims credit for this modification on the American Continent.) Windsor claimed he created the hollow neck banjo with a <b>truss</b> <b>rod,</b> and buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head {{rather than in the}} neck. Gibson claims credit for perfecting the tone ring.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Paradise Guitars {{worked with}} Becker {{to design a}} Jason Becker {{signature}} guitar. The design {{is based on the}} Peavey with colored number fret inlays. Features include an alder body, maple neck with steel 2-way <b>truss</b> <b>rod,</b> maple 16" [...] radius fingerboard, 24 jumbo thin frets with colored number fret marker inlays, black Floyd Rose Pro Style floating Tremolo with Floyd Rose Tremolo stop, Sperzel red satin tuners, 14-degree tilt-back headstock with black Paradise logo and matching tremolo and electronics plates. The pickups are DiMarzio pickups; a PAF Pro-Custom in the neck colored yellow and red, a DP116 HS-2 in the middle colored green, and a Tone Zone-Custom in the bridge colored pink and blue. These colored pickups complement the colored inlays and seem to give the guitar a rainbow effect. There is also a red 5-way switch and purple 1–11 volume knob.|$|E
50|$|To provide {{adjustable}} relief, most guitars have {{an adjustable}} <b>truss</b> <b>rod.</b> Some guitars, such as certain older Guild 12-strings, have two parallel truss rods. Turning the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> screw changes {{the tension of}} the <b>truss</b> <b>rod,</b> and thus the relief. Novice players should not attempt this, as the guitar neck can easily be damaged or broken.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s the {{automatic}} coupler project saw the underframes replaced. The new design was all-steel, reinforced with centre sills {{in lieu of}} the <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> and heavier bracing on the ends, and the brake equipment on the first 201 wagons was upgraded from the previous combined brake cylinder and auxiliary reservoir to a larger brake cylinder and a separate auxiliary reservoir. When the buffers and <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> were removed in the 1950s, the wagon capacity was boosted a further ton.|$|R
5000|$|Limited has a 34" [...] {{scale and}} spalted maple, zebrawood, or bird's eye maple top. Two <b>truss</b> <b>rods.</b> Comes with Traben SB combo pickups, double soapbar setup.|$|R
50|$|Some guitars (notably Rickenbackers) {{come with}} dual <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> {{that are more}} stable and not {{affected}} by seasonal climate changes. They are regarded as being more difficult to adjust.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> is loosened, {{the neck}} bends {{slightly}} {{in response to}} the tension of the strings. Similarly, when tightened the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> straightens the neck by resisting string tension.|$|E
50|$|A wood <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> caboose and a wood <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> {{maintenance}} {{flat car}} {{reside in the}} original passenger coach shed adjacent to the enginehouse. Neither car {{have been used in}} many years.|$|E
50|$|They {{headstock}} {{is that of}} {{a traditional}} Explorer with the Gibsonlogo printed on in gold. The <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover is a white bell hot with Lzzy’ssignature stamped on in gold. Hale's personal model has a gold <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover in contrast.|$|E
5000|$|On older Fender-style {{electric}} guitars with bolt-on necks (and vintage re-issues) [...] - [...] on {{the heel}} of the neck. Adjustment of such <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> {{can be done by}} a Phillips screwdriver and requires prior removal of the guitar's pickguard or neck.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1900 to 1920 days of wood frame {{freight car}} construction, steel <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> {{were used to}} support the {{underside}} of the car in order to provide it with the strength to carry heavy loads. There could be four or more of these <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> under the car floor running the length of the car, and hobos would [...] "Ride the Rods." [...] Some would carry a board to place across the rods to lie on. Others would lie on just one rod and hold on tightly. Riding the rods was very dangerous. When a train moved at high speed, the cars could bounce and rock violently if the track was rough, and rock ballast might be tossed up which could strike a rider.|$|R
50|$|Through {{at least}} the late 1930s, D’Angelico’s guitar necks had {{non-adjustable}} steel reinforcement. Later models had functional <b>truss</b> <b>rods.</b> By the late 40s, D'Angelico was building only the Excel and the New Yorker. All New Yorker models featured pearl inlays in the headstock and fingerboards, as well as quadruple bindings.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> through peghead through 1977.|$|E
50|$|The {{action on}} a guitar is also {{slightly}} {{affected by the}} adjustment of the <b>truss</b> <b>rod.</b> Tightening the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> gives the neck a backward bow and tends to lower the action, and loosening the rod gives the neck a forward bow, giving a higher action.|$|E
50|$|Modern designs {{also include}} {{adjustment}} {{from the side}} of the heel of a bolt-on neck. When looking from the body of the guitar to the head, counterclockwise adjustment decreases the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> tension (correct an underbow) and clockwise adjustment increases the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> tension (correct an overbow).|$|E
50|$|The guitar - {{particularly}} the electric guitar - became the new bestseller. Sales increased enormously {{due to the}} popularity {{of rock and roll}} music {{at the end of the}} 1950s. Because of this development, several technologic advances were introduced (such as putting <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> in guitar necks), and a second factory was built in Pretzfeld, 25 km north of Bubenreuth in the Franconian Switzerland, in 1966. Framus became the largest guitar producer in Europe, employing around 300 workers by the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The guitars {{also had}} {{features}} that were uncommon for the time, but are now {{used by many}} guitar companies, such as 24-fret necks, neck-through construction, {{as well as his}} high-gain, low-noise pickups and stainless steel bridges. His <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> went into a tube-like channel, and steel rods went down to the seventh fret for extra security from headstock breakage, though this made them somewhat neck-heavy. The guitars were also made of solid rock maple, which gave the guitars great sustain and durability.|$|R
50|$|Wood body {{cars had}} steel frames, I-beams on cars 10-310 and steel girders in the sides on cars 311-321. In the first 10 years there were {{problems}} with the bodies flexing but reinforcing the bodies worked. Most wood body cars continued in service {{until the end of}} service in 1957. Spotting features included arched end windows, arched upper sash windows (which were covered up over time during modernization work), and <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> under the frame, necessary to maintain the body's structural rigidity.|$|R
50|$|DR-7 Dreadnought. DR-7 Dreadnought. Laminate spruce top. Laminated {{rosewood}} {{back and}} sides. White binding on body (w/b/w/b/w.) Rosewood overlay on peghead. Peghead bound in white. Adjustable <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> through peghead from 1970 through 1979. Rosewood Bridge and fingerboard. Adjustable Rosewood Bridge on the earliest models. Pearl/pearloid inlay position markers on fingerboard. Chrome closed back tuners (11:1 ratio.) The first year {{is known to}} have a zero fret. High gloss lacquer finish. <b>Truss</b> <b>rod</b> adjustment location is on peg head at nut until 1980. After 1980 <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> adjustment is located internally and is accessed from soundhole.|$|E

50|$|The first vehicle entered {{service in}} March 1889, and was deemed successful. From July 1890 through May 1892, 150 wagons were {{constructed}} by Wright & Edwards at their Braybrook workshops {{on behalf of}} the Victorian Railways, followed by QR152-201 in 1892 constructed by the Railways, rather than being contracted out. These initial wagons were built with swing-motion, diamond-frame bogies; the underframe used both steel and wooden components, and was reinforced with <b>truss</b> <b>rods.</b> The final result provided a wagon with capacity of 26 lt 0 Lcwt 0 qtr t.|$|R
5000|$|The iconic upper bout and {{headstock}} {{silhouettes of}} the Rickenbacker 4001 {{are the most}} salient characteristics of the [...] "crested-wave" [...] body shape designed by luthier Roger Rossmeisl for Rickenbacker's model 4000. The 4001 model features a neck-through construction, a full-wood body, fretboard with metal strings (originally flat-wound, though many players replaced them with round-wounds), twin <b>truss</b> <b>rods,</b> triangle inlays, two pickups, two volume and two tone dials, selector switch, and wiring for Rick-O-Sound (standard in models post-1971). Rickenbacker also produced six-string and 12 string guitars and a short-scale bass, the 3000 model.|$|R
5000|$|The Rickenbacker 360 is an electric, semi-acoustic guitar made by Rickenbacker, {{and part}} of the Rickenbacker 300 Series. The {{instrument}} incorporates many features standard on Rickenbacker guitars, including a three-ply maple/walnut neck, shallow headstock angle, a thick rosewood fretboard finished with clear conversion varnish, and double <b>truss</b> <b>rods.</b> The 360 also features stereo or mono output, a body with Rickenbacker's [...] "crescent moon" [...] cutaway shape and rounded top edge and bound back, and an [...] "R"-shaped trapeze tailpiece. A twelve-string version of the 360 (Rickenbacker 360/12) is available. A three-pickup version of this model is also available, the 370.|$|R
5000|$|On set-neck {{electrics}} [...] - [...] under a cover-plate {{behind the}} nut. Gibson & Epiphone guitars have their <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> bolt {{covered with a}} signature bell-shaped plate. Most Gibson electrics have a 5/16” (8 mm) or a 1/4" [...] (6 mm) hex adjustable <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> nut that can be adjusted with a hex box spanner wrench.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{selling price}} in Japanese yen is often {{included in the}} model number—for example TLS-100 = 100,000 Japanese yen. The higher priced Tokai Gibson replicas have nitrocellulose finishes and long tenon neck joints. Tokai guitars {{have been made in}} Japan, Korea and China. Korean production started around the mid-1990s. Tokai guitars made in Korea (MIK) are lower priced guitars, similar to the Korean Epiphone guitars. The MIK (Made in Korea) guitars can be differentiated by the <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover. Japanese guitars have a two-screw <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover whereas the Korean guitars have a three-screw <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> cover (although some early Korean guitars also have two-screw <b>truss</b> <b>rod</b> covers). The MIK guitars usually have a different Nashville style bridge instead of the usual ABR-1 bridge. Furthermore, MIK Gibson replica guitars usually have a neck made from maple, and the body wood is usually made from either alder, agathis or nato.|$|E

5000|$|Most Murray {{bicycles}} {{were for}} the youth market, often featuring one-piece steel Ashtabula cranksets and internally brazed frames using inexpensive seamed or straight-gauge steel tubing. These low-cost parts and materials undercut the prices of Murray's competition, selling millions of bicycles (often with retailer names) to department stores, hardware stores, and general retailers. Schrekengost styled more than 100 mostly youth bicycles for Sears, Western Auto, Firestone Tire, and other retailers, including the Spaceliner, Western Flyer, and Firestone. By modifying chain guards, luggage carriers, lighting, handlebars, and <b>truss</b> <b>rods,</b> Schrekengost gave each bicycle a distinctive look while retaining the same welded tube frame design.|$|R
5000|$|The Megatar is a fretted {{instrument}} with 12 strings, {{divided in}} two sections of six, where {{one set of}} strings is for bass {{and the other for}} melody. Both sides are normally tuned in fourths intervals. Other tunings and setups are common. The scale length is similar to an electric bass guitar. It uses electronic pickups that should be connected to an amplifier to produce sound. The instruments have two embedded, dual-action <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> and a stereo 1/4" [...] output. The Megatars are usually made with bolt-on necks. However, from 2007 all new instruments are exclusively [...] "neck-through". All models are either built from light-colored maple and alder or premium dark woods like mahogany, sapele, wenge and rosewood.|$|R
50|$|The {{finished}} Greek Revival-style {{building was}} one of the largest west of the Mississippi River for that time period. The framework of the courthouse was constructed of native oak from the area as well as locally manufactured brick for the exterior. Iron <b>truss</b> <b>rods</b> were installed in the building to provide further strength. he exterior walls are 22 inches (55.88 cm) thick on the first floor and 18 inches (45.72 cm) on the second floor. Locally harvested walnut completed most of the interior, trim, and two circular staircases. Originally the courthouse included a ten-foot square tower rising another sixteen feet above the second floor however it was removed in the mid-1800s. The circular walnut staircases were also removed and replaced by the single one presently in use.|$|R
