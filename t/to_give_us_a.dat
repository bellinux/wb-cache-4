25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because of the {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E
500|$|Several {{concepts}} and items of imagery {{have been used}} in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth {{is in the form of}} a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, [...] "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> child," [...] which was compared to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
500|$|Darwaza {{continued}} his political activity, representing Nablus in the Fourth Palestinian Congress in May 1921 and the Seventh Palestinian Congress in June 1928. From 1922 to 1927, {{he served as}} {{the principal of the}} an-Najah National School (later to become an-Najah National University) where he initiated and nurtured an Arab nationalist political educational process. Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zu'aiter, wrote that Darwaza [...] "used <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> weekly lesson on the principles of Nationalism and [...] society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons." [...] Zuaiter also recalls that Darwaza wrote up nationalist and historical plays that his students would perform in.|$|E

500|$|Hurlbut {{worked on}} the 2006 film Waist Deep with {{director}} Vondie Curtis-Hall, and Tom Keogh of The Seattle Times described their work on shots prior to a kidnapping scene in the film as [...] "close to breathtaking". Hurlbut worked as cinematographer on the 2008 film Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell, and Steven Boone of The Star-Ledger noted: [...] "...Shane Hurlbut's widescreen sports cinematography does conspire with two notorious disco covers of classical music <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> thrill along with the cheap laughs." [...] Hurlbut collaborated with director McG as director of photography on the 2006 film We Are Marshall. Hurlbut and McG decided to use vintage lenses and film stock from the time period to evoke a feeling of the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more {{critical}} review, describing the opening as [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and early {{events in the}} novel as [...] "soap-opera-ish". Despite these objections, she concluded, [...] "Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, he is able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> sense of what daily life was like in Kabul — both {{before and during the}} harsh reign of the Taliban." [...] Similarly, Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that A Thousand Splendid Suns was ultimately [...] "a little shaky as a work of literature".|$|E
500|$|... "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] {{was named}} as one the two worst songs on The New Classic by Devone Jones of PopMatters who criticized Azalea for [...] "literally preaching—to youths, rather than [...] to them". AbsolutePunk's Jake Jenkins called it [...] "a muddled mess of a narrative", and added, [...] " [...] does nothing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> clear picture, or any picture at all really, of what [...] been through". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{said that the}} song was [...] "sort of blandly inspirational" [...] and [...] "as numbing" [...] as {{material}} by T.I.. While Troy L. Smith of The Plain Dealer felt Azalea [...] " [...] promise" [...] with the song; he dismissed the production as [...] "leftovers from one of Eminem's recent albums".|$|E

500|$|Frise and Clark {{had grown}} {{concerned}} with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. [...] Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. [...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't you going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to bid?" [...] Frise told him, [...] "Mr Hindmarsh, you have nothing to bid with." [...] The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after taking}} a job at Columbia University, nuclear {{physicist}} Đàm Thanh Sơn {{paid a visit to}} Andrei Starinets, a friend from Sơn's undergraduate days who happened to be doing a Ph.D. in string theory at New York University. Although the two men had no intention of collaborating, Sơn soon realized that the AdS/CFT calculations Starinets was doing could shed light on some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic state of matter produced when heavy ions are collided at high energies. In collaboration with Starinets and Pavel Kovtun, Sơn was able to use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate a key parameter of the plasma. As Sơn later recalled, [...] "We turned the calculation on its head <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> prediction for the value of the shear viscosity of a plasma... A friend of mine in nuclear physics joked that ours was the first useful paper to come out of string theory." ...|$|E

500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E
500|$|As an Irishwoman, Streep acted {{opposite}} Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), {{which was}} {{entered into the}} Venice Film Festival in its year of release. [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that [...] "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze". Later that year, Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing. The film gained positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared: [...] "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she's able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable." [...] Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role [...] "is {{one of the least}} self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career" [...] but that she [...] "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [...] one of her most moving".|$|E

The memory of Campo angling across field and bomboozling Mark Carter, Sean Fitzpatrick and John Kirwan will remain forever.
