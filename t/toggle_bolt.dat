2500|$|Mayo, {{a diving}} platform, was {{equipped}} with dive chambers to accommodate the dive teams. They worked in six hour shifts, and [...] when they weren't in the water remained in the saturation chambers for the entire 28 days the operation took. The divers used hydraulic abrasive water jets to cut 26 holes through both the outer and inner hulls. [...] The salvage divers mounted custom guidance rings around {{the holes in the}} sub and lowered guide cables to each through the holes in Giant 4. The team then used the four guide cables to lower a custom-made giant gripper, similar to a <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt,</b> which were custom designed to fit each hole, and the divers maneuvered them through the guidance ring.|$|E
50|$|A <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{also known}} as a {{butterfly}} anchor, is a fastener for hanging things on hollow walls such as drywall.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{varieties}} of wall plug are mechanical anchors for heavy duty loads and hollow wall fixings for fixing to plasterboard. The first mechanical anchor, the Rawlbolt, was designed in 1930sâ€™ by the Rawlplug {{company and the}} first fixing for hollow walls was the <b>Toggle</b> <b>Bolt,</b> which was also designed by Rawlplug in 1941.|$|E
50|$|<b>Toggle</b> <b>bolts</b> have wings {{that open}} inside a hollow wall, bracing against it {{to hold the}} {{fastener}} securely.|$|R
5000|$|Anchors {{designed}} {{especially for}} fastening to hollow walls, include <b>toggle</b> <b>bolts</b> and molly bolts.These wall anchors are also known by other names, such as, [...] "tacos", drywall hangers, expansion nuts, etc.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to follow the provided instructions when using a sex swing. Secure mounting is vital to avoid injury to the suspended partner from falling. The use of <b>toggle</b> <b>bolts,</b> such as {{would be used to}} hang a dreamcatcher, is not appropriate. Installing springs, if supplied, {{is important}} to reduce physical shock to the suspended partner caused by rapid deceleration when bouncing in a sex swing.|$|R
50|$|Hanging crafts can project {{abstract}} shapes {{fashioned from}} sheet metal, wood, paper or plastic materials, connected by wire or chord, whose individual elements {{are capable of}} moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Heavy hangings are hung with a lag bolt with deep grooves in the threads for maximum grip, or with a <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt</b> that uses a large collapsible nut to increase clamping pressure of the bolt.|$|E
50|$|While {{the short}} recoil design is {{most common in}} pistols, the very first short-recoil-operated firearm {{was also the first}} machine gun, the Maxim gun. It used a <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt</b> similar to the one Borchardt later adapted to pistols. Vladimirov also used the short recoil {{principle}} in the Soviet KPV-14.5 heavy machine gun which has been in service with the Russian military and Middle Eastern armed forces since 1949. Melvin Johnson also used the short recoil principle in his M1941 rifle and M1941 Johnson machine gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} locking and {{unlocking}} the barrel differentiates the {{wide array of}} short recoil designs. Most common are the John Browning tilting barrel designs based on either the swinging link and locking lugs as used in the M1911 pistol or the linkless cam design used in the Hi Power and CZ 75. Other designs are the locking block design found in the Walther P38 and Beretta 92, rollers in the MG42, or a rotating barrel used in the Beretta 8000 and others. An unusual variant is the <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt</b> design of the Borchardt C-93 and its descendant, the Luger pistol.|$|E
50|$|Oscar rivets {{are similar}} to blind rivets in {{appearance}} and installation, but have splits (typically three) along the hollow shaft. These splits cause the shaft to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a <b>toggle</b> <b>bolt's</b> nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet. This flare (or flange) provides a wide bearing surface that reduces the chance of rivet pull-out. This design is ideal for high vibration applications where the back surface is inaccessible.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical Plastics Corp. is {{a company}} based in Norwalk, Connecticut that [...] "produces screw anchors and <b>toggle</b> <b>bolts</b> used in the {{construction}} industry." [...] These anchors, which range from light-duty to heavy-duty, are [...] "used to fasten objects to walls, ceilings, and floors made of concrete, brick, cement block, drywall, and fiberglass". Mechanical Plastics Corp. currently contains two main divisions, TOGGLER and Wej-It. According to The New York Times, Mechanical Plastics currently distributes its products to twenty-four countries internationally, and these products are then sold at retail stores such as Lowe's. TOGGLER anchor system, whose patents are owned by Mechanical Plastics Corp., {{is used in the}} area of home improvement, when driving [...] "a screw or nail directly into a framing member behind the wall surface" [...] is not possible and it is necessary to choose a fastener that is [...] "specifically designed for gripping in the hollow spaces between the studs and joists." [...] The Popular Mechanics journal, states that [...] "The basic Toggler is the screw anchor which can work in both solid-wall and hollow-wall applications. It consists of a polypropylene anchor and a small plastic setting key. All you do is drill a hole in your wall and slide the anchor in place. For solid walls, the anchor is just wedged into the hole, like a normal plastic anchor. If the wall is hollow, you simply slide the key setting pin into the anchor and push." [...] As such, these <b>Toggle</b> <b>bolts</b> are used to [...] "support items like mirrors, framed artwork, and towel racks." [...] Mechanical Plastics Corp. also manufactures the Wej-It expansion bolt, which [...] "is a one-piece all-steel anchor for attaching anything to concrete, brick, or stone." ...|$|R
5000|$|The KV3 was {{produced}} in 1998-2001 in Japan. Features Duncan Designed pickups, Jackson JT580LP Tremolo, 22 frets, 1x volume, 1x tone, 1x 3way <b>toggle,</b> sharktooth inlays, <b>bolt</b> on maple neck, poplar body. Mother of pearl inlaid rosewood fret board. The jack output was situated upon the upper wing, just like in more expensive series. No longer in production.|$|R
