40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} numerically explores the {{limiting}} two {{degrees of freedom}} (streamwise and transverse) free oscillation response of three circular cylinders, placed in an in-line configuration subjected to a uniform cross flow at low Reynolds numbers. Three identical cylinders with a low mass ratio (m⁎= 4 /πm⁎= 4 /π) and zero damping are considered. The spacing between the cylinders L/DL/D is equal to 4. The reduced velocity Ur is varied from 2 to 13 for two values of the Reynolds number (Re= 100 Re= 100 and Re= 150 Re= 150). For comparison purposes, the free oscillation responses of an isolated cylinder and a <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> pair under the same conditions are also evaluated. The results show that the dynamic behaviors of three in-line cylinders are significantly {{different from those of the}} <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> pair. While the maximum transverse oscillation amplitude increases by about 25 %, there is now a very large streamwise oscillation amplitude (AX/D≈ 1. 3 AX/D≈ 1. 3), comparable to those in the transverse direction. They appear at Ur> 9 Ur> 9. The frequency responses of the triple cylinder case are much richer; in particular, at higher Ur. There is a clear low frequency component which is most evident in the streamwise direction. Many of the displacement trajectories of the triple cylinder case can almost be described as “bounded random movements”. The associated phase portraits and the Poincaré maps show that the dynamical characteristics of the triple cylinder configuration are considerably richer than those of the <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> pair. Even at such low Re, the free oscillations of three in-line cylinders already seem to approach a chaotic response. In particular, there is evidence that the fluid–structure system approaches to chaos via the quasi-periodic route. Due to such much more complex dynamical characteristics, it is therefore highly risky to predict the free oscillation behaviors of multiple in-line cylinders by extrapolating those of the <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> pair...|$|E

Then, these conclusions are extended to various situations which are more representative of the usual airframe noise tests that are typically conducted in the QFF. In particular, this provides an opportunity to compare the refraction/convection effects of the QFF jet flow to the reflection/diffraction induced by the experimental apparatus.

Two-dimensional, unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes ow simulations were performed using the OpenFOAM open source code.

A Reynolds number of 100, based on cylinder diameter, was used {{to ensure that the}} flow remained laminar. The validity of the code was tested through comparisons with benchmark solutions for flow in a lid-friven cavity and flow around a single cylinder. For the <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> flow, also mesh convergence was demonstrated, to within a couple of percent for the RMS lift coefficient. The mean and fluctuating lift and drag coefficients were recorded for centre-to-centre cylinder spacings between 2 and 10 diameters. A critical cylinder spacing was found between 3. 75 and 4 diameters. The fluctuating forces jumped appreciably at the critical spacing. It was found that there exists only one reattachment and one separation point on the downstream cylinder for spacings greater than the critical spacing.

40|$|In {{order to}} model the {{turbulent}} flow around cylindrical structures in various configurations, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) {{are used in the}} present work. LES utilize a highly accurate model at reasonable time-consumption, offering an insight into the details of a complex flow. Standard Smagorinsky subgrid scale model is used to include the effects of the subgrid scale motions. Three configurations of cylindrical structures are chosen in this study, inspired by the arrangements of the subsea pipelines in the marine environment. The simplest and most extensive studied arrangement is the flow around a single, smooth circular cylinder in a uniform current. Hence, this configuration is used for the assessment of the numerical tools’ performance. The second configuration, a circular cylinder in the vicinity of a plane wall is chosen to represent the flow around free-spanning subsea pipelines. Performed for various gap to diameter ratios (G/D), the simulations successfully capture the details of the flow in the cylinder wake and the interaction with the seabed boundary layer. The influence of the less explored parameters, the thickness and the shape of the inflow profile, is explored. The three-dimensional (3 D) LES results show clear improvements over the previously published two-dimensional (2 D) simulations. Two circular cylinders, placed one behind the other, relative to the incoming current, are called the tandem arrangement. The third configuration, <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> in the vicinity of a plane wall correspond to double pipelines or flowlines in the subsea systems. This configuration has received little research attention. The flow around <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> close to the wall is therefore compared to the simpler and more thoroughly understood configurations. It is concluded that the existing classification of the flow around one cylinder close to the wall describes well the flow around the upstream cylinder at large horizontal span ratios (L/D). Behaviour of the flow around <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> at large G/D can be described through the flow classification for the <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> in the infinite fluid. At intermediate G/D (and various L/D), the presence of the wall causes stronger influence than recorded for the flow around one cylinder at the same G/D...|$|R

Under conditions in which the breaker tongue impacts the downstream cylinder around the wave crest level, the wave force on the downstream cylinder is higher than the force on the upstream cylinder.

Also, the effect of increase the horizontal distance between two tandem circular cylinders on flow pattern and heat transfer is investigated.

While the downstream cylinder diameter, D, was fixed at 25 mm, the upstream cylinder diameter, d, was varied from 0. 24 D to D. The spacing between the cylinders was 5. 5 d, at which vortices were shed from both cylinders. Two distinct vortex frequencies were detected behind the downstream cylinder for the first time for two <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> of the same diameter. The two vortex frequencies remained for d/D= 1. 0 - 0. 4. One was the same as detected in the gap of the cylinders, and the other was of relatively low frequency and was ascribed to vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder. While the former, if normalized, declined progressively from 0. 196 to 0. 173, the latter increased from 0. 12 to 0. 203 with decreasing d/D from 1 to 0. 24. The flow structure around the two cylinders is examined {{in the context of the}} observed Strouhal numbers.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of component installation effects on flow generated, far-field sound for a <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> configuration {{tested in the}} NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Quiet Flow Facility (QFF) is presented in this paper. The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) was used to simulate the insertion losses resulting from the interaction of incident sound generated by flow over the cylinders with the QFF apparatus. Two sources of sound were used to model the flow generated noise: 1) a line of point dipoles placed at the axis of the rear cylinder, and 2) CFD/CAA generated unsteady pressures on the cylinder surfaces in free flow. As observed at the microphone locations used in the test, {{the effects of the}} QFF components on the acoustic field were small, being on the order of 2 dB for all frequencies considered, when the dipole line source was employed. Installation effects were higher when the time dependent surface pressures were used as noise generators, being approximately 6 to 9 dB for the primary shedding frequency and 3 to 5 dB for the second harmonic. This difference is most likely due to the absence of near field flow non-uniformities in the FSC calculations. Inclusion of these effects through the use of penetrable data surfaces located in the linear flow region should yield better estimates of the incident sound field.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel hybrid RANS/LES methodology for accurate flow and noise predictions of the NASA <b>Tandem</b> <b>Cylinder</b> Experiment is investigated. The proposed approach, the modified Flow Simulation Methodology (FSM), is based on scaling the turbulence viscosity and the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate with a damping function. This damping function consists of three individual components, a function based on the Kolmogorov length-scale ensuring correct behaviour in the direct numerical simulation (DNS) limit, a function ensuring that FSM provides the correct damping in large-eddy simulation (LES) mode, and a shielding function that forces the switch from Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) to LES to occur outside the boundary layer. The FSM is proposed for the k ??-SST two-equation model (FSM-SST) and for an Explicit-Algebraic-Stress-Model (FSM-EASM), which is better suited to resolve anisotropy and non-equilibrium of the unresolved scales and the strain and rotation-rate dependent coefficients introduce a dynamic response of the model to the resolved flow field. Simulations are performed on a relatively coarse grid and the FSM data are compared with results obtained from the Scale-Adaptive-Simulation (SAS) and IDDES approaches. Acoustic predictions are obtained using an acoustic analogy approach based on Curle’s theory. The FSM-SST approach was found to predict the hydrodynamic field in very good agreement with reference data, whereas the FSM-EASM did not improve the predictions.

Simula- tions are performed using three different hybrid RANS/LES methodologies which employ different techniques to transform the baseline RANS model into a turbulence resolving subgrid scale model. The approaches investigated are the Scale-Adaptive-Simulation which computes the subgrid dissipation-rate from a transport equation that is sensitive to the v. Karman length scale, the IDDES approach and a modifed Flow-Simulation-Methodology (FSM) which both rely on replacing the modeled turbulent length scale {{with a measure of}} the local grid spacing.

The simulations are performed with the open-source finite volume code OpenFOAM and acoustic predictions are obtained using an acoustic analogy based on Curle's theory.

40|$|CFD is {{a useful}} tool for {{understanding}} continuum mechanics and analyzing flows, both disturbed and undisturbed. When we analyze flow around cylinders with CFD, we can get numerical results. We have the opportunity to see how the flow actually will distribute around cylinders. Pressure and Velocity can be obtained and measured in all points of the simulation field and the valid forces imposed on the cylinder can be obtained too. Computational Fluid Dynamics is cheaper and accessible to get results than doing experiments CFD simulation is also cheaper than making tests, and at present, CFD can substitute or enhance many experiments. On streamlined over sea or river underwater pipeline affect the horizontal force of viscous resistance, which is proportional to the square of the flow rate. Of course, this configuration and analysis of a cylinder with a subsequent analysis of the two, taken with an ulterior motive. Most probably a good example of a joint international project "North Stream" and "Nord Stream- 2 ". The first project is a branch of gas pipeline laid {{on the bottom of the}} Baltic Sea. The second, in turn, will be the second branch of the main gas pipeline, which will run in tandem with the first. In other words, the relevance of this issue is in demand, especially when it comes to a marine pipeline, with energy consumption increasing, and therefore requires payment and the amount of product are being pumped. Just offshore field development infrastructure is not in place and is developing dynamically. Due to the daily production of gas, there is growing demand for the expansion of the oil and gas transportation. Subsea pipelines, get the constant influence of regular and irregular waves due to the influence of underwater currents in certain areas. Depending on the nature of the flow, it can influence the vortex formation, which can erode the soil directly beneath the pipe and because of this certain parts of the pipeline can be formed free-spans. They can occur during the vortex formation and as a consequence of vortex induced vibrations. To prevent such situations and the effects of the design of pipelines, it is necessary to simulate the flow around the planned pipeline. In this paper, calculated the flow impact on a subsea pipeline, which is associated with the formation of internal waves in a stratified flow based on the results of simulation models, which made in OpenFOAM software.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some {{experimental}} results {{about the physical}} effects of a cylinder’s streamwise oscillation motion on a downstream one in a tandem arrangement. The upstream cylinder undergoes a controlled simple harmonic oscillation at amplitudes A/d = 0. 2 – 0. 8, where d is the cylinder diameter, and the frequency ratio of fe/fsfe/fs = 0 – 3. 0, where fefe is the cylinder oscillation frequency and fsfs is the natural frequency of vortex shedding from a single stationary cylinder. Under these conditions, the vortex shedding is locked to the controlled oscillation motion. Flow visualisation using the planar laser-induced fluorescence and qualitative measurements using hot-wire anemometry reveal three distinct flow regimes behind the downstream cylinder. For fe/fs>(fe/fs) cfe/fs>(fe/fs) c, where (fe/fs) c(fe/fs) c is a critical frequency ratio which depends on A/d and Reynolds number Re, a so-called SA-mode occurs. The upstream oscillating cylinder generates binary vortices symmetrically arranged about the centreline, each containing a pair of counter-rotating vortices, and the downstream cylinder sheds vortices alternately at 0. 5 fe 0. 5 fe. For 0. 7 – 1. 0 <fe/fs<(fe/fs) c<fe/fs<(fe/fs) c a complex vortex street that consists of two outer rows of vortices generated by the oscillating cylinder and two inner rows of vortices shed from the downstream stationary cylinder, which {{is referred to as}} AA-mode. For 0. 3 – 0. 6 <fe/fs<<fe/fs< 0. 8 – 1. 0, one single staggered vortex street (A-mode) is observed. It is also found that, when fe/fsfe/fs is near unity, the streamwise interaction of the two cylinders gives rise to the most energetic wake in the cross-stream direction, in terms of its maximum width, and the wake is AA-mode-like. The effects of other parameters such as the spacing between the two cylinders, Re and A/d on the flow pattern are also discussed in details. The observations are further compared to the stationary <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinder</b> cases...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of overset grids for simulating high Reynolds number flows in OpenFOAM. The problem of <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> is specifically chosen as an appropriate test model due to (a) a direct relevance to the marine industry and (b) the availability of experimental results conducted at the Basic Aerodynamics Research Tunnel at LaRC. Usage of overset grids in OpenFOAM has previously been demonstrated only using SUGGAR++, and this library is not easily available to the general public. This paper thus explores the application an in-house overset grid library (Overset Parallel Engine for Aerodynamics Applications) OPErA in OpenFOAM. For verification purposes of the overset coupling, results are presented for the inline oscillation of two cylinders in low Reynolds numbers Re 40. For the high Reynolds number case of Re 1. 66 × 105, an assesment of the forces and the flow between the cylinders are presented for static <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a distance to diameter spacing of (L/D = 1. 4). This specific spacing corresponds to a sub-critical spacing (short separation) where the drag on the rear cylinder is negative. For single grid computations, force predictions for (a) a non-linear URANS model and (b) a hybrid model are presented. For overset grid computations, only non-linear URANS results are presented to verify {{the implementation of the}} overset coupling. Comparisons between single grid and overset grid cases for the forces and the flow features are very encouranging and demonstrate greater potential in using overset grids for moving body problems.

40|$|Fifteen {{submissions}} in the <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{category of}} the First Workshop on Benchmark problems for Airframe Noise Computations are summarized. Although the geometry is relatively simple, the problem involves complex physics. Researchers employed various block-structured, overset, unstructured and embedded Cartesian grid techniques and considerable computational resources to simulate the flow. The solutions are compared against each other and experimental data from 2 facilities. Overall, the simulations captured the gross features of the flow, but resolving all the details which {{would be necessary to}} compute the noise remains challenging. In particular, how to best simulate the effects of the experimental transition strip, and the associated high Reynolds number effects, was unclear. Furthermore, capturing the spanwise variation proved difficult...|$|R
40|$|Flow-structure {{interaction}} is a generic problem for many engineering applications, such as flow [...] induced oscillations of marine risers and cables. In this thesis a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) approach based on spectral/hp elements is employed. Structural motion implies {{changes on the}} boundaries of the flow domain. An Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) scheme is incorporated to efficiently move the mesh without remeshing. Efficient three-dimensional simulations with periodicity in at least one space direction are achieved using Hybrid Fourier-Jacobi expansions. Both 2 D and 3 D formulations can treat an arbitrary number of oscillating bodies. Due to the large computational demands of the resulting systems parallel computing is used with MPI. Numerical experiments are run and systematic data sets are obtained for flow around two cylinders. Stationary <b>cylinders</b> in <b>tandem</b> and side-by-side arrangements are examined parametrically over spacing and Reynolds number. Parametric studies of <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> in prescribed motion and free oscillation are also conducted. For <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders,</b> sudden changes in the forces occur at a critical spacing where a transition from reattachment to binary vortex regime occurs. (cont.) A hysteresis effect is observed for spacings near the nominal critical, where for given Reynolds number there are two possible solutions depending on the initial conditions. Discrepancies in the prediction of the critical spacing using 2 D and 3 D simulations are identified and explained. The three-dimensional effects are found to cause a weakening of the strength of the primary vortices and a delay in the inception to) binary vortex regime. When the cylinders oscillate in prescribed motion, the phase angle of the oscillations can alter significantly the hydrodynamic work on the downstream cylinder. For spacings smaller than the critical spacing, the lock-on range of frequencies is wider than that of a single cylinder. As the oscillations amplitude increases however, pockets of non-lock-on regions are found within the Arnold synchronization regions. A shift towards higher frequencies in the synchronization range is found for the in-phase oscillations compared to the anti-phase oscillations. A consistent change is found in the spanwise correlations. For the elastically mounted two-degree of freedom <b>tandem</b> <b>cylinders</b> it is found that the synchronization range of the upstream cylinder is wider when its latest shed pair of vortices intercepts the downstream cylinder. (cont.) A shifting of the synchronization curve on the reduced velocity axis is observed and explained in terms of the natural shedding frequency of the corresponding stationary system of cylinders. by Georgios V.
