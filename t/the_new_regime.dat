5|$|In May 1942, John Bevan {{replaced}} Stanley {{as head of}} the LCS, {{after the}} latter had asked Winston Churchill for permission to re-enter politics. At the same time, the committee was given much broader powers. Hardboiled was sidelined by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> and had been dropped entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.|$|E
5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism {{was transformed into}} an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal word of God, as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E
5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, {{despite the fact that he}} tried to cooperate with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime.</b> He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} coup {{that led to}} the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic (1889), accentuated the decline of shipbuilding in the country. For four decades, between 1890 and 1930 no new ships were built in Brazil. The focus of republican governments was to equip the army to fight internal uprisings in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime's</b> early years. <b>The</b> Navy was perceived as a threat to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> republican <b>regime,</b> as it had been more loyal to the Monarchy.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime.</b> In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he {{was rewarded}} with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour, not only because he held this office early under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> {{but also because it}} was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th {{century the}} {{university}} was restored. In 1836, after six hundred years, the medieval walls were partially demolished, allowing the town to expand.

25|$|In Latin America, liberal unrest {{dates back}} to the 18th century, when liberal {{agitation}} in Latin America led to independence from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>regimes</b> were generally liberal in their political outlook, and employed the philosophy of positivism, which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.|$|R
5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised {{the government of}} the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and Valtellina valley, the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

5|$|Roberto Guerro is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss voiced and motion-captured by actor JB Blanc. A decade before Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'état. He escaped execution by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without {{a good source of}} funds he would be unable to compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} Khrushchev arranged {{the removal of}} Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi. In response to a popular uprising, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention {{to withdraw from the}} Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Army invaded. Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos. Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> {{passed its}} own version of Legea Rurală, thus {{effectively}} imposing land reform, as well as putting an end to corvées. This was accomplished through discussions in August 1864 by the newly established Council of State, where the law was advanced by, among others, Kogălniceanu, Bolintineanu, George D. Vernescu, Gheorghe Apostoleanu and Alexandru Papadopol-Callimachi. Kogălniceanu's other measures as minister included: the establishment of Bucharest University, the introduction of identity papers, the establishment of a national police corps (comprising Dorobanți units), the unification of Border Police.|$|E

5|$|After 2008, Detroit's {{front office}} and {{coaching}} personnel were essentially overhauled {{by the team}} ownership. Matt Millen, the team's incumbent general manager and CEO since 2001, was terminated on September 28, 2008. His replacement, Martin Mayhew, ultimately terminated head coach Rod Marinelli in the off-season. Marinelli was replaced by Jim Schwartz, then defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans. Schwartz ultimately revamped the entire Detroit offensive (and defensive) philosophieshiring Scott Linehan and Gunther Cunningham, respectively. Detroit held the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and selected quarterback Matthew Stafford out of the University of Georgia. Stafford was named the team's starting quarterback out of training camp, but he battled various injuries throughout the season. Much of the 2008 Detroit roster was released by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> and the 2009 team was viewed as somewhat of a work-in-progress, but Johnson still finished the 2009 season with 67 receptions, 984 yards, and five touchdowns, while missing two games.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The exodus, which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime,</b> some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup by disgruntled {{military}} officers, Constantine I abdicated for {{a second}} time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II. Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime.</b> Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf. Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family (including the infant Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, HMS Calypso.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} RCP found existence {{outside the}} Labour Party increasingly difficult {{with the end}} of wartime militancy. The RCP's membership and influence started to decline. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>regimes</b> in Eastern Europe caused further debate within the RCP, as they did within the International as a whole. The leadership of the RCP around Haston was more cautious with regard to declaring these <b>new</b> <b>regimes</b> to be degenerated workers states than the International's leadership around Ernest Mandel and Michel Pablo.|$|R
50|$|A {{nationalist}} coup in 1943 led to {{the sudden}} advent of Col. Juan Perón as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime's</b> chief policy-maker. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> government quickly made the control of price gouging in banking and public services a policy centerpiece, and in 1944, the savings & loan was again re-chartered as the Municipal Bank of Buenos Aires to give depositors more commercial banking options in Argentina's growing public sector.|$|R

5|$|His {{allegiance}} to the Lancastrian regime remained strong {{enough for him to}} take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life. Commanding the central battle of the king's army he fell, with the duke of Buckingham and Lord Egremont whilst forming a human shield in defence of the king, against the victorious Yorkists in the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460. Even though the king had fallen into Yorkist hands, Beaumont was not attainted, and his son was allowed to enter into his inheritance. Presumably in an attempt to reconcile his family to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime.</b> This failed, and Beaumont's second son (but who was his heir) – the by now second Viscount fought against the victorious army of the Yorkist king, Edward IV at the battle of Towton in April the next year.|$|E
5|$|In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 {{adopted by}} the Cortes de Cadiz served {{as the basis for}} {{independence}} in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{situation}} in Prussia was changing. Following the death of Frederick William III, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>regime</b> of Frederick William IV was far more liberal. Spontini was dismissed, and the Berlin premiere of Les Huguenots was arranged (20 May 1842). On the instigation of Alexander von Humboldt, Meyerbeer was installed {{later in the year}} as Prussian Generalmusikedirektor and director of music for the Royal Court. Meyerbeer wrote a number of works for court occasions, and also provided music, at the King's request, for the first staging on Berlin in 1856 of his brother Michael's play Struensee (based on the life of Johann Friedrich Struensee), which had also been proscribed under the previous regime.|$|E
