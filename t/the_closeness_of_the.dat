5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{committed}} four turnovers, {{compared with}} East Carolina's one. The Broncos fumbled {{the ball away}} twice and threw two interceptions. Despite the disparity in turnover margin, the teams were strikingly similar in several statistical categories, indicating <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game: Each team earned seven points off the turnovers. Both teams committed 50yards in penalties; the Pirates had seven penalties to the Broncos' four. In addition, both teams earned 22 firstdowns.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date {{to those of the}} later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E

We show the existence and uniqueness <b>of</b> solutions to <b>the</b> one-dimensional regular and singular BSRDEs with Lévy processes by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BSRDE and obtain the optimal control for the non-homogeneous case.

5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|For {{the inauguration}} of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of {{a story about the}} {{prehistory}} of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities through getting them tickets to ride the Air Force one but she was denied of this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip of the then California's Governor and wife led to <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reagans and Marcoses.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. <b>The</b> <b>closeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florida outcome {{led to a}} recount.

The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266).
