5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{directly}} elected {{every five years}} by universal suffrage since 1979. However, voter turnout at European Parliament elections has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> 2014 stood at 42.54% of all European voters.|$|E

5|$|Jim Foster, {{then the}} most {{powerful}} political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide boycott of orange juice was organized. The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, {{and the result was}} an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.|$|E
5|$|The average turnout at the {{referendum}} was 43.51%. The figure includes the voters living abroad, whose turnout was only 3.51%; they comprise more than 9% {{of the total}} Croatian electorate. The highest turnouts were recorded {{in the city of}} Zagreb and in Varaždin County, at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively, while the lowest <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Croatia was recorded in Lika-Senj County at just 34.52%. There is no turnout threshold for a referendum to be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|Advance voting {{took place}} in 901 polling {{stations}} in the country. Expatriate voting took place between 6 and 9 April at 241 polling stations at embassies and consulates. One national electronic voter list was used for early voting; though for the 17 April poll, voters could only vote at their designated local polling station. The expatriate voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> 91 countries rose by 2.2% to a record-high 10.7%, with 35,000 people casting their votes. In addition, 400 Finns voted on ships at sea.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, 2008, after a 5-week-long campaign, the Conservatives {{increased}} their seat count in parliament to 143, up from 127 at {{the dissolution of}} the previous parliament; however, the actual popular vote among Canadians dropped slightly by 167,494 votes. As a result of the lowest voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Canadian electoral history, this represented only 22% of eligible Canadian voters, the lowest level of support of any winning party in Canadian history. Meanwhile, the number of opposition Liberal MPs fell from 95 to 77 seats. 155 MPs are required to form a majority government in Canada's 308-seat parliament, relegating Harper to minority government once again.|$|E
5|$|Race {{officials}} {{expected a}} record <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> {{the days leading}} up to the Preakness, estimating over 50,000 people. They hoped that the possibility of Secretariat completing the Triple Crown and Sham attempting to foil Secretariat's run would lead to an increase in attendance. The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise have exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E
50|$|Turnout for the {{election}} was low, at 33%. The highest <b>turnouts</b> were <b>in</b> the rural areas, specifically in Goulbourn, Rideau and the highest West Carleton (45%). The lowest <b>turnout</b> was <b>in</b> Somerset Ward at 25% turnout.|$|R

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
50|$|In the 1976 election, the PQ won 71 seats, {{shocking}} both Quebecers {{and other}} Canadians. With {{one of the}} highest voting <b>turnouts</b> <b>in</b> Quebec history, 41.4 per cent of the electorate voted for the PQ. The PQ formed a majority government.|$|R
50|$|By {{geographical}} area, Dublin South-East was {{the smallest}} constituency in the country.

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bradley carried {{the vote of}} many Gold Democrats. He also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with {{the views of the}} American Protective Association, an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization. Some {{estimates}} placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of Paducah, Lexington, Ashland, Covington, and Frankfort. Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state. Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524. Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky. <b>Turnout</b> <b>in</b> the election was 85%. More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.|$|E
5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter <b>turnout,</b> <b>in</b> a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} effectively {{started on}} 20 September 1991, even though relatively minor offensive actions {{had already been}} undertaken. By {{the end of the}} month, it suffered from serious delays and manpower shortages caused by low call-up <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Serbia. In early October, the original campaign objectives were reduced as Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and his allies gained greater control of the JNA. Subsequently, the campaign objectives were redefined to deny the Croatian Government access to parts of Croatia that contained substantial Serb populations and to protect Croatian Serbs. The campaign culminated in late November and early December with the Battle of Vukovar and the Siege of Dubrovnik. A limited Croatian counterattack and the development of the HV led to a stalemate on the battlefield.|$|E

50|$|Dee Margo took {{first place}} in the mayoral race but did not win a {{majority}} of votes, so he and David Saucedo competed in a runoff election.

5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} {{were held in}} Croatia {{for the first time}} on 2 August 1992, simultaneously with the 1992 parliamentary elections. Voter turnout was 74.9%. The result was a victory for Franjo Tuđman of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), who received 57.8% of the vote in the first round of the elections, ahead of 7 other candidates. Dražen Budiša, the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) candidate and runner-up in the election, received 22.3% of the vote. The second presidential elections in modern Croatia were held on 15 June 1997. The incumbent, Franjo Tuđman ran opposed by Zdravko Tomac, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and Vlado Gotovac, nominated by the HSLS. Tomac and Gotovac received 21.0% and 17.6% of votes respectively in the first round of voting, and Tuđman secured another term. The third presidential {{elections were}} held on 24 January 2000, to fill the office of the President of the Republic, after the incumbent Franjo Tuđman died on 10 December 1999. The first round of voting saw Stjepan Mesić, candidate of the Croatian People's Party (HNS) in the lead, receiving 41.3% of votes, followed by Dražen Budiša of the HSLS with 27.8% of votes and Mate Granić, nominated by the HDZ, receiving 22.6% of votes. The runoff election, the first in the presidential elections of modern Croatia, was held on 7 February, when Mesić won, picking up 56.9% of votes. Voter <b>turnout</b> <b>in</b> the first round was 63.0% and 60.9% in the runoff. The first round of the fourth presidential elections was held on 2 January 2005. No candidate secured a first-round victory; however, the incumbent Mesić enjoyed a substantial lead over other candidates, as he received 48.9% of votes, and the second and third ranked candidates Jadranka Kosor (HDZ) and Boris Mikšić (independent) managed only 20.3% and 17.8% of voter support respectively. Ultimately, Mesić won reelection, receiving 65.9% of votes in the runoff held on 16 January. The 2009–2010 presidential election was held on 27 December 2009, with Ivo Josipović (SDP) picking up 32.4% of votes, followed by Milan Bandić (independent), Andrija Hebrang (HDZ) and Nadan Vidošević (independent) receiving 14.8%, 12.0% and 11.3% of the votes respectively. The second round of voting was held on 10 January 2010, when Josipović defeated Bandić, receiving 60.3% of the vote. The first round of the most recent presidential election was held on 28 December 2014, where Josipović won 38.46% of the votes, followed by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović (HDZ) who received 37.22% of ballots. The third was an independent candidate, Ivan Vilibor Sinčić who received 16.42% of votes, and Milan Kujundžić (Croatian Dawn – Party of the People) who was supported by 6.3% of the votes. The runoff was held on 11 January 2015, and Grabar-Kitarović won by a margin of approximately one percentage point.|$|E
