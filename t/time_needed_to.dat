5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

50|$|Bae {{compared}} the energy <b>need</b> <b>to</b> speed spacecraft for conventional rockets {{and that for}} photonic railway or PLT-BLP, in terms of specific energy (J/kg) that is the energy required for propelling a unit mass to a given velocity. Fig. 11 shows examples of the specific energy (J/kg) {{as a function of}} the spacecraft velocity (km/s) related with the Mars photonic railway. Two curves represent the specific energies for conventional rockets with Isp = 500 s and 3,000 s, respectively. The upper straight solid line represents the specific energy for BLP and the lower straight solid line for photonic railway or PLT-BLP with M=1,000. Here M is the photon thrust amplification factor. It is interesting that BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with Isp=500 s, if the travel <b>time</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be shorter than 1 month. BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with Isp=3,000 s, if the travel time is shorter than a week. However, photonic railway or PLT-BPL with M=1,000 becomes more energy efficient than rockets with Isp=500 s, if the travel <b>time</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be shorter than 2 month. BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with Isp=3,000 s, if the travel <b>time</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be shorter than two weeks. Eventually, when the flight <b>time</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be 3 days, for example, both BLP and photonic railway or PLT-BLP are more energy efficient than rockets with Isp=3,000 s. This estimate demonstrates photonic railway is potentially the most energy efficient way to commute to planets in the solar system.|$|R
50|$|Most animal glues are soluble in water, {{useful for}} joints which may at some <b>time</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be separated. Alcohol is {{sometimes}} applied to such joints to dehydrate the glue, {{making it more}} brittle and easier to crack apart.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

Wizards began introducing 4th Edition online content in Dragon and Dungeon magazines. 4th Edition is designed to offer more streamlined game play, while the new rules framework intended to reduce the preparation <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> run a game and make the game more accessible to new players.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live {{performances}} on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the brigade's combat service/combat {{sustainment}} support battalions took part in equipment testing and training in Rapid City, South Dakota. It tested the Multifunction Agile Remote Control Robot IV, a route clearance robot, {{with the assistance of}} the South Dakota National Guard. The bulk of the brigade spent the summer at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to train aviation assets for deploying units. In June 2008, the brigade trained the aviation assets of the 34th Infantry Division in air combat, air assault, and other tactics related to aviation. For this mission, the brigade was assisted by the 479th Field Artillery Brigade, which handled ground exercises. As part of a new training routine, the brigade trained the 34th Infantry Division's aviation units at Fort Rucker, spending a longer time training the unit because it continued to train the brigade as it mobilized and prepared to deploy. Other units trained with the Division, but none through the entire mobilization process. This process used new and never-before-used facilities to streamline training exercises. Purportedly, it gave the 166th Aviation Brigade much additional time for training, as the streamlining process made some programs more efficient, cutting <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prepare for them in half.|$|E
5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, 2012 Square Enix {{announced}} that they were remaking Dragon Quest VII exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS {{and that it would}} be released in Japan in February 2013. Later that day, Square Enix confirmed that the release date would be February 7, 2013 for Japan. Similarly to Dragon Quest IX, the game features visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, unique backgrounds and enemies that have individual attack characteristics. The remake was originally not intended for a release outside of Japan, in part due to the sheer cost and <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> localize the game's substantial content. After numerous letters from core Dragon Quest fans in France, as well as Square Enix and Nintendo executives, the decision was made to release the 3DS port worldwide. In the November 2015 Nintendo Direct, it was shown that Dragon Quest VII would be coming outside Japan in 2016, with the new subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. The international release of the 3DS remake contained a completely retranslated script which followed the localization style of games since Square Enix's release of Dragon Quest VIII in 2005, including numerous name and terminology changes for characters from the original Dragon Warrior VII release. The orchestral score from the Japanese release was also replaced with a synthesized MIDI soundtrack used by the iOS and Android versions of the game.|$|E

5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
5|$|US113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware {{state line}} in three {{sections}} starting in 1998. The first section was constructed {{on a new}} alignment from north of MD818 to south of MD589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD90 interchange 24 {{years after it was}} partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US113 reconstruction, from south of MD589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.|$|E
