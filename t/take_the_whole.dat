25|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{took place}} on May 18, when the Armenians captured Nakhchivan's exclave of Karki, a tiny territory through which Armenia's main North-South highway passes. The exclave presently remains under Armenian control. After the fall of Shusha, the Mütallibov government of Azerbaijan accused Armenia of moving to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Nakhchivan (a claim that was denied by Armenian government officials). However, Heydar Aliyev declared a unilateral ceasefire on May 23 and sought to conclude a separate peace with Armenia. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrossian expressed his willingness to sign a cooperation treaty with Nakhchivan to end the fighting and subsequently a cease-fire was agreed upon.|$|E
25|$|Bladud's son Leir reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon {{reaching}} old age {{he decides}} to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules {{for three years and}} then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son.|$|E

500|$|When {{the games}} are {{broadcast}} on Fox, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the game and, thus the duo has called many significant moments in the rivalry. In 2004, {{the first game of}} the season between the two teams, on April 16, a Friday night, was nationally broadcast on Fox, because it marked the first time the two teams were facing each other since the memorable 2003 ALCS. Fox Sports President Ed Goren said of decision to have the game broadcast on Fox: [...] "If were up to me, we'd <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> series and come back a week later and carry all their games at Yankee Stadium...We started thinking about this at some point after the Yankees closed the deal with A-Rod. ... This is sort of a relaunch of the season in the middle of April. This is going to be an event." [...] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called the broadcast [...] "an extension of the postseason brought into April." [...] This was the first broadcast of a regular season game in prime-time since Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break Roger Maris' record in 1998. In October, when the two teams met in the ALCS, Selig moved Game 5 of the series to primetime due to the rematch.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "grand" [...] {{party of}} diplomats left Lithuania for Moscow in May 1566. Lithuania was {{prepared}} to split Livonia with Russia, {{with a view to}} a joint offensive to drive Sweden from the area. However, this was seen as a sign of weakness by Russian diplomats, who instead suggested that Russia <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Livonia, including Riga, through the ceding of Courland in southern Livonia and Polotsk on the Lithuanian–Russian border. The transfer of Riga, and the surrounding entrance to the River Dvina, troubled the Lithuanians, since much of their trade depended on safe passage through it and they had already built fortifications to protect it. Ivan expanded his demands in July, calling for Ösel in addition to Dorpat and Narva. No agreement was forthcoming and a ten-day break was taken in negotiations, during which time various Russian meetings were held (including the zemsky sobor, the Assembly of the Land) to discuss the issues at stake. Within the Assembly, the church's representative stressed the need to [...] "keep" [...] Riga (though it had not yet been conquered), while the Boyars were less keen on an overall peace with Lithuania, noting the danger posed by a joint Polish-Lithuanian state. Talks were then halted and hostilities resumed upon the return of the ambassadors to Lithuania.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture and land tenancy, Beverley received additional revenue from land sales in western Virginia. The easing of restrictive land laws by the Virginia colonial government {{allowed him to}} establish his own terms with settlers on his lands, and he initially sold parcels in the Shenandoah Valley. On September 6, 1736, Beverley, John and Richard Randolph and John Robinson were deeded a land patent by Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet {{on behalf of the}} crown for a [...] tract at the headwaters of the South Fork Shenandoah River in present-day Augusta County. On September 16 the Randolphs and Robinson transferred sole ownership of the tract to Beverley, who planned to survey and sell it; the tract, which became known as Beverley Manor, encouraged further settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He commissioned James Patton, a ship captain from Ulster, to recruit Irish and Scotch-Irish immigrants to purchase and settle his Augusta County land. On August 8, 1737, Beverley wrote to Patton, [...] "I should be very glad if you could import families enough to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> off from our hands at a reasonable price and tho' the order mentions families from Pensilvania , yet families from Ireland will do as well". In 1738 he authorized John Lewis of northern Ireland, the father of Thomas Lewis, to show and sell his land in Augusta County and donated a lot in Staunton for the construction of the Augusta County Courthouse ten years later.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} week of November – {{well into the}} lucrative Christmas sales period and close to {{four months after the}} concerts – Harrison voiced his {{frustration}} at the stalemate with Capitol on ABC's late-night chat show, The Dick Cavett Show. Harrison was on the program to promote the Raga documentary with Shankar, but after making a surprise guest performance with Gary Wright's new band Wonderwheel, he launched into a complaint about his US record company's interference and threatened to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> album package to Columbia. With the outburst attracting unfavourable attention in the press, where Capitol were viewed as [...] "profiteering on the backs of famine victims", the company eventually backed down and agreed to release the album on Harrison's terms. Of all the labels involved, only Columbia would make any money from The Concert for Bangladesh – 25 cents on every copy sold. Although none of these royalties went to the artist, Dylan and his record company were already benefiting from the exposure provided by the Bangladesh concerts, through the timely release of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. Of the other featured artists at the Concert for Bangladesh, the careers of both Preston (A Records) and Russell (Shelter) likewise prospered {{as a result of their}} participation, but their record companies imposed no such conditions on Apple and Capitol. In January 1972, Melody Makers Richard Williams remarked in his Concert for Bangladesh album review: [...] "Between them, Capitol and CBS have proved that, when it comes to awareness and enlightenment, the business is still several years behind the musicians." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, [...] "Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making {{themselves}} millionaires. I could <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> business away from them." [...] In 1925, {{he set out}} to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money. In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as [...] "exceedingly American" [...] (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: [...] "not Jewish," [...] in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's [...] "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning of}} July 3 {{revealed}} the full {{scale of the}} Union defenses, as enemy artillery opened fire {{at a distance of}} 500 yards with a [...] "terrific and galling fire", followed by a ferocious assault on Steuart's position. The result was a [...] "terrible slaughter" [...] of the Third Brigade, which fought for many hours without relief, exhausting their ammunition, but successfully holding their position. Then, late on the morning of July 3, Johnson ordered a bayonet charge against the well-fortified enemy lines, [...] "confident of their ability to sweep him away and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Union line in reverse". Steuart was appalled, and was strongly critical of the attack, but direct orders could not be disobeyed, and Steuart gave the order to [...] "Left face" [...] and [...] "file right", sending his men into heavy enfilading fire. Steuart's Third Brigade advanced against the Union breastworks and attempted several times to wrest control of Culp's Hill, {{a vital part of the}} Union Army defensive line. The result was a [...] "slaughterpen", as the Second Maryland and the Third North Carolina regiments courageously charged a well-defended position strongly held by three brigades, a few reaching within twenty paces of the enemy lines. So severe were the casualties among his men that Steuart is said to have broken down and wept, wringing his hands and crying [...] "my poor boys". Overall, the failed attack on Culp's Hill cost Johnson's division almost 2,000 men, of which 700 were accounted for by Steuart's brigade alone—far more than any other brigade in the division. At Hagerstown, on the 8th July, out of a pre-battle strength of 2,200, just 1,200 men reported for duty. The casualty rate among the Second Maryland and Third North Carolina was between one half and two-thirds, in the space of just ten hours.|$|E

But the danger of Fuhrer's possible taking over Europe was still the lesser evil for him than the possible Communist expansion. The [...] "Hitler dilemma" [...] was the only thing husband and wife have ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised Fuhrer, referring to him as [...] "an idiot". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own Joan of Arc (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a {{sweepstakes}} and uses it to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry should know (what he [...] then believes to be) the truth about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse {{at the hands of}} the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding world and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr Weasley is a member of the Order, and accompanies Harry to his visit in the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she [...] "wanted to kill parents", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks's. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Arthur has been promoted to Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.|$|E
