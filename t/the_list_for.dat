5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>for</b> the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>for</b> Luke. <b>The</b> <b>list</b> <b>for</b> Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
