40|$|One of {{the major}} failure modes in the railway {{industry}} is wheel wear. Wheel wear affects the dynamic characteristics of vehicles and the dynamic force impact on the rail, and can in worst cases scenario cause derailment. The wheel conditions also influences the wear and required maintenance on the rail. In this paper the correlation of wear rate and dynamic force between wheel and rail is studied to specify the most costeffective wheel maintenance interval. Two cars, total of sixteen wheels, were selected. In order to calculate the wear trend, measurements have been performed, by MiniProfTM, {{for a period of}} 12 months with the cars in traffic. During the same time period, the trend of track forces from the two cars has been obtained from the research station, outside Luleå, Sweden.

40|$|The rail {{dynamics}} {{modeling package}} NUCARS {{has been used}} extensively to model freight cars. We have found that {{it can also be}} used effectively to model freight locomotives. This thesis discusses the development of a NUCARS model to represent a six-axle freight locomotive equipped with steerable trucks. This includes separating it into a set of individual bodies, representing the suspension components as inter-body connections, and validation of the computer model. This model is then used to conduct a study of the impact on tangent track stability and curving performance of varying suspension parameters. It is found that the presence of damping in the system improves hunting stability, while increasing wheel conicity is harmful to stability and varying the flexicoiling stiffness has little effect. In curving, the clearances between the axles and truck frame are very important. Limiting these clearances in the steerable truck causes it to curve similar to a conventional straight locomotive truck and increases both the <b>track</b> <b>force</b> ratios and angles of attack. Increasing the wheel conicity increases an axle's tendency to align with the track and improves the locomotive's curving performance. The lateral stiffness of the inter-axle links and inter-motor links has little effect on the curving of the locomotive. iii Acknowledgments I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Mehdi Ahmadian, for his guidance and time in teaching me about rail vehicles.

40|$|The Swedish {{iron ore}} company LKAB uses freight wagon to {{transport}} iron ore from the mines in Kiruna and Malmberget to Luleå and Narvik. Within {{a research project}} at KTH Rail Vehicles a simulation model of the freight vehicle has been built up within the Multibody simulation code GENSYS. This work is defined along with the mentioned project to investigate the possible sources of RCF of the wheels {{while the number of}} damages especially in winters is considerably high. The new track model is built with both concrete and wooden sleepers. Dynamic properties of the track are set, mostly, by using measured receptances; however, PSD of the vertical <b>track</b> <b>forces</b> are also compared to tune the system. Validation of the model is done via comparing simulation and measurement. Modal analysis is performed to detect any possible resonances.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) are the crosstie {{beam support}} in railway track systems. They are designed and constructed under flexural constraints {{in order to}} carry and transfer the dynamic wheel loads from the rails to the ground. Under perfect wheel and rail conditions, the dynamic loading on railway tracks could {{be treated as a}} quasi-static load using a dynamic impact factor. The current design method for the prestressed concrete sleepers taking into account the quasi-static effect is based on allowable stress where crack initiation is not permitted. In reality, the impact events are often detected due to the uncertainties of wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration. Over the design life span of the prestressed concrete sleepers, there exists the feasibility of extreme and repeated impact loading events. These have led to two proposed limit states for the consideration of structural engineers: ultimate limit states and fatigue limit states. Prestressing techniques have been long used to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under repeated impact cycles. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers, their impact behavior and capacity under the repetitions of severe impact loads are unclear. This paper presents the experimental investigation aimed at understanding the dynamic crack propagations in prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under repeated impact loading. The impact forces have been correlated against the probabilistic <b>track</b> <b>force</b> distribution obtained from an Australian heavy haul rail network.

40|$|Pre-stressed {{concrete}} sleepers are {{the main}} components of railway track systems. To carry and transfer the dynamic wheel loads from the rails to the ground, their current design and construction are limited by allowable flexural stress constraints under service conditions. In current design practice for such a component, the dynamic load effects due to wheel/rail interactions are treated as a quasi-static load using a dynamic impact factor. Then, the allowable stresses eliminate a crack initiation. In reality, the impact events are frequently recorded because of the uncertainties of wheel or rail irregularities such as flat wheels and dipped rails. These effects cause cracking in the concrete sleepers, resulting in excessive maintenance. Limit states design philosophy for the pre-stressed concrete sleepers, containing ultimate and fatigue limit states, has been recently proposed based on structural reliability concept to rationalise the design method and minimise the maintenance. On the basis of probabilistic approach, the high-magnitude low-cycle fatigue limit states, which are more significant in terms of damage evolution, have been addressed in this article. Series of repeated impact tests for the in-situ pre-stressed concrete sleepers were carried out using the Australian largest high-capacity drop weight impact testing machine at the University of Wollongong. The impact forces have been simulated in relation to the probabilistic <b>track</b> <b>force</b> distribution obtained from a heavy haul rail network. This article focuses on the impact responses of the cumulatively damaged sleepers. The effects on such responses of the track environments including soft and hard track supports are also highlighted in this article. It is found that a concrete sleeper damaged by the impact fatigue cycles could possess significant reserve capacity for resisting the axle load in a similar manner as the undamaged sleeper...|$|E
40|$|Installed as the {{crosstie}} {{beam support}} in railway track systems, the prestressed concrete sleepers (or railroad ties) are designed {{in order to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails to the ground. It is nowadays best known that railway tracks {{are subject to the}} impact loading conditions, which are attributable to the train operations with either wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration, as well as there exists the potential of repeated load experience during the design life of the prestressed concrete sleepers. These have led to two main limit states for the design consideration: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under repeated impact loads. Prestressed concrete has played a significant role as to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate repeated impact loads. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, their impact responses and behaviours under the repetitions of severe impact loads are not deeply appreciated nor taken into the design consideration. This experimental investigation was aimed at understanding the residual capacity of prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under repeated impact loading, in order to form {{the state of the art}} of limit states design concept for prestressed concrete sleepers. A high-capacity drop weight impact testing machine was constructed at the University of Wollongong as to achieve the purpose. Series of repeated impact tests for the in-situ prestressed concrete sleepers were carried out, ranging from low to high impact magnitudes. The impact forces have been correlated against the probabilistic <b>track</b> <b>force</b> distribution obtained from a Queensland heavy haul rail network. The impactdamaged sleepers were re-tested under static conditions in order to evaluate the residual energy toughness in accordance with the Australian Standard. It is found that a concrete sleeper damaged by an impact load could possess significant reserve capacity sufficient for resisting the axle load of about 1. 05 to 1. 10 times of the design axle loads. The accumulative impact damage and residual energy toughness under different magnitudes of probabilistic impacts are highlighted in this paper. The effects of track environment including soft and hard tracks are also presented as to implement design guidance related to the serviceability or fatigue limit states design...|$|E
