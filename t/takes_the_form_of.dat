5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere {{it appears as}} narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1902, {{the ninth}} {{anniversary of the}} loss of the ship, a {{monument}} to Rusalka was erected in Tallinn. Sculpted by Amandus Adamson, it <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a bronze angel standing on a granite pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Part Four of the Will– The Fourth Part of the Will, embodying {{the virtue}} of justice, <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a snake. It is {{released}} by Arthur {{near the end of}} the book when he makes Sir Thursday angry.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb); similarly, {{myoglobin}} can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb).|$|R
50|$|In Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, dāna is the {{practice}} of cultivating generosity. It can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> giving to an individual in distress or need. It can also <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.|$|R
50|$|Anti-art can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> art or not. It is {{posited that}} anti-art need not even <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> art, {{in order to}} embody its {{function}} as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.|$|R
5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E
5|$|Dark {{energy in}} its {{simplest}} formulation <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, {{the details of}} its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.|$|E

40|$|Electron-beam-pumped {{semiconductor}} ultra-violet optical sources (ESUVOSs) {{are disclosed}} that use ballistic electron pumped {{wide bandgap semiconductor}} materials. The sources may produce incoherent radiation and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> electron-beam-pumped light emitting triodes (ELETs). The sources may produce coherent radiation and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> electron-beam-pumped laser triodes (ELTs). <b>The</b> ELTs may <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> electron-beam-pumped vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (EVCSEL) or edge emitting electron-beam-pumped lasers (EEELs). The semiconductor medium may <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> an aluminum gallium nitride alloy that has a mole fraction of aluminum selected to give a desired emission wavelength, diamond, or diamond-like carbon (DLC). The sources may be produced from discrete components that are assembled after their individual formation {{or they may be}} produced using batch MEMS-type or semiconductor-type processing techniques to build them up in a whole or partial monolithic manner, or combination thereof...|$|R

5|$|It is the 1st Joker Card of the 1st Deck in the Dark Carnival mythology. Recording {{sessions}} for the album took place from 1991 to 1992 at Miller Midi Productions and The Tempermill Studio. The album {{is the first}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as {{a representation of the}} violence that occurs within the ghettos, which <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the upper class.|$|E
5|$|Mohini plays {{a lesser}} {{role in a}} Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are {{performing}} rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, {{all of which are}} overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur {{at any time of}} the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E

5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayan {{writing system}} <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a syllabary of over 1,000 characters, all modeled on {{parts of the}} human body {{including}} internal organs. This unique script has been compared variously to Phoenician, Etruscan, Hebrew, and even the undeciphered script of the Butuan paleograph. While there are no mother-tongue speakers of Eskayan, it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer-run cultural schools. The Eskayan language and script has been the object of ongoing controversy.|$|E
5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork {{for the rest of the}} albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E

In the game's ending, Ventus smiles in Castle Oblivion, while he is still asleep.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{the curve}} illustrated above. An {{economy that is}} operating on the PPF {{is said to be}} efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E

50|$|A {{recruitment}} tool is {{an advertising}} method that aids in creating {{interest in and}} getting people for a typically political organization. Historically recruitment tools have often <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> posters or films, though in modern times recruitment tools have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> advergame video games. Other tools include things like sponsorships of sporting events, or ads on TV.|$|R
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a triungulin.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
50|$|Incorporeal {{property}}, whether movable or immovable, {{may also}} be attached. Such property may <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a lease, a bill of exchange, a promissory note, a bond or other security for the payment of money. It may also <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> an interest in a partnership, shares in a company, or a member’s interest in a close corporation.|$|R
