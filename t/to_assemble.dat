5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>assemble,</b> outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station.|$|E
5|$|After Spider-Man defeats {{a figure}} {{known as the}} Gold Goblin, Nick Fury tells him the Green Goblin has used a portal <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> a multiverse Sinister Six and plans to take over Spider-Man's dimension. S.H.I.E.L.D. then used the portal <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> {{alternative}} versions of Spider-Man and other spider-powered heroes like Spider-Girl, Spider-Ham, and Spider-Man 2099 {{to aid in the}} battle. Spider-Man pursues the Green Goblin and his alternative versions. After he defeats the alternative Goblins, Spider-Man fights various versions of Vulture, Electro, Sandman, Doctor Octopus, and Mysterio, as well as the Sinister Soldiers—armored soldiers working for the multiverse Sinister Six.|$|E

5|$|Classes in {{the program}} began in 1955. The program's long-time director, Howard Sheath, {{beginning}} in March 1956, instituted several innovations to the program which proved popular with external students.

5|$|Lack of an {{available}} airborne division {{forced the}} Allies <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> {{an ad hoc}} formation, the 1st Airborne Task Force, in Italy on 1July1944.

5|$|Later, in 2001, the Campagne-sur-Aude {{site was}} {{explored}} again, {{this time by}} Gerard Chauvet, Jean-Luc Le Douarec, Colette Rives and Yvonne Vidoux. After 13 years of searching, they had uncovered a mostly complete skeleton that contained much more material, including bones unknown from the holotype. The material all went to the Musee des Dinosaures, and together took about 10 years <b>to</b> <b>assemble.</b>|$|E
5|$|More Jews {{came from}} Bukhara, Persia, and, {{following}} the Farhud pogrom in Iraq in 1941, many more immigrants shifted to Bombay.

40|$|An in-space {{construction}} (erectable) approach <b>to</b> <b>assembling</b> Freedom {{is planned}} but the increasing {{complexity of the}} station design along with a decrease in shuttle capability {{over the past several}} years has led to an assembly sequence that requires more resources (EVA, lift, volume) than the shuttle can provide given a fixed number of flights. One way to address these issues is to adopt a pre-integrated approach <b>to</b> <b>assembling</b> Freedom. A pre-integrated approach combines station primary structure and distributed systems into discrete sections that are assembled and checked out on the ground. The section is then launched as a single structural entity on the shuttle and attached to the orbiting station is then launched as a single structural entity on the shuttle and attached to the orbiting station with a minimum of EVA. The feasibility of a pre-integrated approach <b>to</b> <b>assembling</b> Freedon is discussed. The structural configuration, packaging, and shuttle integration of discrete pre-integrated elements for Freedom assembly are discussed. It is shown that the pre-integrated approach to assembly reduces EVA and increases shuttle margin with respect to mass, volume, and center of gravity limits when compared to the baseline Freedom assembly sequence...|$|R

It was the largest political gathering ever <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{structural}} material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi {{to change his}} plans for the statue's assembly.

5|$|The {{details of}} the plan were worked out with Oberst (Colonel) Karl Koller, Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle's chief of staff, Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3). <b>To</b> <b>assemble</b> {{sufficient}} strength some training units had to be mobilised (the bulk of the Jagdwaffe was in the Soviet Union owing to Operation Barbarossa).|$|E
5|$|The first star {{catalogue}} in Greek astronomy {{was created by}} Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, {{with the help of}} Timocharis.

5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply.

When hearing that aid was near, {{the population of the}} city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> a force in Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the relief was stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} more critical issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century.
