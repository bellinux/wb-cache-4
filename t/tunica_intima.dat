5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the <b>tunica</b> <b>intima</b> (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT), {{also called}} intimal medial thickness, is a {{measurement of the}} thickness of <b>tunica</b> <b>intima</b> and tunica media, the innermost two layers of the wall of an artery.

Measurements of the wall thickness of blood vessels can also be done using other imaging modalities.|$|E
25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial <b>tunica</b> <b>intima,</b> a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E
30|$|Vessel {{tortuosity}} {{may increase}} the technical difficulty thus raising the risks. Some investigators reported that the stent could not arrive at the right position due to the tortuous artery pathway (Kim et al. 2004). This {{was one of the}} major reasons of failure. In this condition, we used double-micro-wire to increase the support power. This way not only reduced the single micro wire inactivity bumped the <b>tunica</b> <b>intimae,</b> but also shortened the whole time of the procedure. This is another cause of the high success rate. For the longer lesion (Mori C) and excessively tortuous pathway, BES is not a better choice. After all, the BES is less flexible than SES.|$|R

2500|$|Veins do {{not develop}} atheromata, {{because they are}} not {{subjected}} to the same hemodynamic pressure that arteries are, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in bypass surgery. The accumulation (swelling) is always in the <b>tunica</b> <b>intima,</b> between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle middle layer of the artery wall. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells but of accumulations of white blood cells, especially macrophages, that have taken up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). [...] After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. [...] When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the center to inner surface of each atherosclerotic plaque.

40|$|Understanding how {{the precise}} {{interactions}} of nerves, immune cells and adipose tissue account for cardiovascular and metabolic biology {{is a central}} aim of biomedical research at present. A long standing paradigm holds that the vascular wall is composed of three concentric tissue coats (<b>tunicae)</b> : <b>intima,</b> media, and adventitia. However, large- and medium-sized arteries, where usually atherosclerotic lesions develop, are consistently surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue, we recently designated tunica adiposa (in brief, adiposa like intima, media, adventitia). According to present paradigm, atherosclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease featured by endothelial dysfunction/intimal thickening, medial atrophy and adventitial lesions associated with adipose dysfunction, whereas hypertension is characterized by hyperinnervation-associated medial thickening due to smooth muscle cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia. Periadventitial adipose tissue expansion is associated with increased infiltration of immune cells, both adipocytes and immunocytes secreting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory (metabotrophic) signaling proteins collectively dubbed adipokines. However, the role of perivascular nerves and their interactions with immune cells and paracrine adipose tissue is not yet evaluated in such an integrated way. The present review attempts to briefly highlight the findings in basic and translational sciences in this area focusing on neuro-immune-adipose interactions, herein referred to as triactome.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar os efeitos do treinamento físico resistido (TR) sobre pressão arterial, reatividade e morfologia vascular de ratos hipertensos induzidos por L-NAME. MÉTODOS: Ratos Wistar machos (200 - 250 g) foram divididos em 3 grupos: normotenso sedentário (NS), hipertenso sedentário (HS) e hipertenso treinado (HT). A hipertensão foi induzida pela administração de L-NAME (40 mg/kg) na água de beber por 4 semanas. A pressão arterial foi avaliada antes e após o TR. O TR foi realizado utilizando 50 % de 1 RM, em 3 séries de 10 repetições, 3 vezes por semana, durante quatro semanas. A reatividade vascular foi mensurada em artéria mesentérica superior por curvas concentração resposta ao nitroprussiato de sódio (NPS) e fenilefrina (FEN). Além disso, foram realizadas análises histológicas e estereológicas. RESULTADOS: O TR inibiu o aumento das pressões arteriais média e diastólica. Foi observada uma redução significativa na resposta máxima e na potência da FEN entre os grupos HS e HT. A análise histológica evidenciou aspecto normal para as <b>túnicas</b> <b>íntima,</b> média e adventícia em todos os grupos. Não houve diferença significativa nas áreas do lúmen, da túnica média e total das artérias dos grupos HS e HT em relação ao NS.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{the effects of}} Resistance Training (RT) on arterial pressure, and on vascular reactivity and morphology, of L-NAME-treated hypertensive rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) were allocated into Sedentary Normotensive (SN), Sedentary Hypertensive (SH) and Trained Hypertensive (TH) groups. Hypertension was induced by adding L-NAME (40 mg/Kg) to the drinking water for four weeks. Arterial pressure was evaluated before and after RT. RT was performed using 50 % of 1 RM, 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times per week for four weeks. Vascular reactivity was measured in rat mesenteric artery rings by concentration-response curves to sodium nitroprusside (SNP); phenylephrine (PHE) was also used for histological and stereological analysis. RESULTS: Resistance training inhibited the increase in mean and diastolic arterial pressures. Significant reduction was observed in Rmax (maximal response) and pD 2 (potency) of PHE between SH and TH groups. Arteries demonstrated normal intima, media and adventitia layers in all groups. Stereological analysis demonstrated {{no significant difference in}} luminal, tunica media, and total areas of arteries in the SH and TH groups when compared to the SN group. Wall-to-lumen ratio of SH arteries was significantly different compared to SN arteries (p< 0. 05) but there was no difference when compared to TH arteries. CONCLUSIONS: RT was able to prevent an increase in blood pressure under the conditions in this study. This appears to involve a vasoconstrictor regulation mechanism and maintenance of luminal diameter in L-NAME induced hypertensive rats...|$|R
50|$|The most {{striking}} histopathological {{changes of the}} aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the <b>tunica</b> media and <b>intima</b> layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in foam cells, extracellular free cholesterol crystals, calcifications, thrombosis, and ulcerations and ruptures of the layers. Adventitial inflammatory infiltrate is present.However, the degradation of the tunica media {{by means of a}} proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia. There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.|$|R
40|$|Irreversible {{electroporation}} (IRE) {{is a novel}} ablation {{technique in}} the treatment of unresectable cancer. The non-thermal mechanism is thought to cause mostly apoptosis compared to necrosis in thermal techniques. Both in experimental and clinical studies, a waiting time between ablation and tissue or imaging analysis to allow for cell death through apoptosis, is often reported. However, the dynamics of the IRE effect over time remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to summarize these effects in relation to the time between treatment and evaluation. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for original articles using IRE on pancreas, liver or surrounding structures in animal or human studies. Data on pathology and time between IRE and evaluation were extracted. Of 2602 screened studies, 36 could be included, regarding IRE in liver (n = 24), pancreas (n = 4), blood vessels (n = 4) and nerves (n = 4) in over 440 animals (pig, rat, goat and rabbit). No eligible human studies were found. In liver and pancreas, the first signs of apoptosis and haemorrhage were observed 1 - 2 hours after treatment, and remained visible until 24 hours in liver and 7 days in pancreas after which the damaged tissue was replaced by fibrosis. In solitary blood vessels, the <b>tunica</b> media, <b>intima</b> and lumen remained unchanged for 24 hours. After 7 days, inflammation, fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle cells were demonstrated, which persisted until 35 days. In nerves, the median time until demonstrable histological changes was 7 days. Tissue damage after IRE is a dynamic process with remarkable time differences between tissues in animals. Whereas pancreas and liver showed the first damages after 1 - 2 hours, this took 24 hours in blood vessels and 7 days in nerve...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Unique {{inflammatory}} lesions {{affecting the}} ascending aorta and pulmonary artery of BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) {{were identified in}} a pilot and two subsequent experiments to characterize the potential effect of MCMV infection on diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions. Suckling BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were inoculated with MCMV and subsequently fed either a commercial mouse diet or a synthetic atherogenic diet from weaning. The three experiments varied {{with respect to the}} age of the mice at the time of MCMV inoculation and the dose of virus given. The conditions of MCMV exposure were progressively modified in the three experiments to increase the prevalence of MCMV-associated inflam-matory lesions in the pulmonary artery and aorta. In the final experiment, in which suckling mice were inoculated at 9 days of age, MCMV-associated artentic lesions had an observed prevalence at 8 weeks post-inoculation of 87. 5 % (743) in BALB/c mice on the normal diet and 100 % (8 / 8) in C 57 BL/ 6 mice on the normal diet and in both strains on the atherogenic diet.

40|$|AIMS: The {{integrin}} alpha(v) beta(3) {{is highly}} expressed in atherosclerotic plaques by medial and intimal smooth muscle cells and by endothelial cells of angiogenic microvessels. In this study, we have assessed non-invasive molecular {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) of plaque-associated alpha(v) beta(3) integrin expression on transgenic ApoE(-/-) mice with a low molecular weight peptidomimetic of Arg-Gly-Asp (mimRGD) grafted to gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Gd-DTPA-g-mimRGD). The analogous compound Eu-DTPA-g-mimRGD was employed for an in vivo competition experiment and to confirm the molecular targeting. The specific interaction of mimRGD conjugated to Gd-DTPA or to (99 m) Tc-DTPA with alpha(v) beta(3) integrin was furthermore confirmed on Jurkat T lymphocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The mimRGD was synthesized and conjugated to DTPA. DTPA-g-mimRGD was complexed with GdCl(3). 6 H(2) O, EuCl(3). 6 H(2) O, or with [(99 m) Tc(CO) (3) (H(2) O) (3) ](+). MRI evaluation was performed on a 4. 7 T Bruker imaging system. Blood pharmacokinetics of Gd-DTPA-g-mimRGD were assessed in Wistar rats and in c 57 bl/ 6 j mice. The presence of angiogenic blood vessels and the expression of alpha(v) beta(3) integrin were confirmed in aorta specimens by immunohistochemistry. Gd-DTPA-g-mimRGD produced a strong enhancement of the external structures of the aortic wall and of the more profound layers (possibly <b>tunica</b> media and <b>intima).</b> The aortic lumen seemed to be restrained and distorted. Pre-injection of Eu-DTPA-g-mimRGD diminished the Gd-DTPA-g-mimRGD binding to atherosclerotic plaque and confirmed the specific molecular targeting. A slower blood clearance was observed for Gd-DTPA-g-mimRGD, as indicated by a prolonged elimination half-life and a diminished total clearance. CONCLUSION: The new compound is potentially useful for the diagnosis of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and of other pathologies characterized by alpha(v) beta(3) integrin expression, such as cancer and inflammation. The delayed blood clearance, the significant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, and the low immunogenicity of the mimetic molecule highlight its potential for an industrial and clinical implementation. status: publishe...|$|R
