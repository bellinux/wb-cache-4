5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn <b>the</b> <b>weeds</b> in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E

The study area was located in the Takakuma Experimental Forest of Kagoshima University. The operational time of weeding at a young sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) stand were recordrd during four growing seasons. The stand was divided into five sections, with different weeding schedules used in each section: weeding four times during the 4 -year period (every year), three times, or twice (alternate years). The mean heights of the herbaceous and woody coppices and the degrees of visibility of neighbor planted trees in the stand were measured because these values could affect the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> operation. <b>The</b> following results were obtained: The operational time per hectare of <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> twice operations were 30 - 57 % shorter than <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> four times it, on the other hand <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> three times operation was 20 % shorter or 5 % longer than <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> four times it.

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out <b>the</b> <b>weeds</b> that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Weed {{suppression}} and weeding {{are necessary}} measures for rice cultivation. <b>Weed</b> suppression precedes <b>the</b> process of <b>weeding.</b> It means suppressing {{the growth of}} young weeds and creating a weed-less environment.

In this paper, we will show how we developed a weed suppression robot for the purpose of reducing <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> work load. <b>The</b> robot has a laser range finder for autonomous mobility and a robot arm for weed suppression. It travels along the rice rows without stepping on and injuring the rice plants in a paddy field. The robot arm applies force to <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> seedlings and thereby suppresses <b>the</b> growth of <b>weeds.</b> This paper will explain the methodology of the autonomous mobile, <b>the</b> experiment in <b>weed</b> suppression, and <b>the</b> method of controlling the robot’s posture on uneven ground...|$|R
