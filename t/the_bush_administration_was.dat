5|$|Cheney was a {{prominent}} member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), {{commonly known as the}} Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>was</b> too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

25|$|On February 12, 2006 Deutsche Welle {{reported}} that German authorities were negotiating Kurnaz's repatriation. The German magazine Focus reported in 2006 that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> trying {{to tie the}} release of Kurnaz to Germany's agreeing to accept four other Guantanamo detainees. The USA had cleared approximately 120 detainees for release or transfer. But many could not be returned to their countries of origin. The German and American governments denied that Kurnaz's release had been tied to Germany accepting other detainees. Focus {{reported that}} the German government has agreed to accept one other detainee, not four. It said that the US had not informed the German government of {{the identities of the}} other detainees it wanted them to accept.|$|E
25|$|Fossil fuel {{regulations}} {{are part of}} the energy policy in the United States and have gained major significance with the strong dependence on fossil fuel based energy. Regulatory processes are established at the federal and state level due to the immense economic, socio-political and environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction and production. Over 80% of the United States' energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> marked by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided a monetary incentive for renewable energy adoption and addressed the issue of climate change. The Obama administration was made up of advocates for renewable energy and natural gas, while Donald Trump built his campaign on promises to revive the coal industry.|$|E

25|$|Questions {{related to}} the {{technical}} details {{of the collapse of}} the buildings of the World Trade Center have been debated for years, including rebuttals and ridicule. Controlled demolition conspiracy theories were first suggested in October 2001. Eric Hufschmid's book, Painful Questions: An Analysis of the September 11th Attack, in which the controlled demolition theory is explicitly advocated, was published in September 2002. David Ray Griffin and Steven E. Jones are the two most prominent advocates of the theory. Griffin's book The New Pearl Harbor, published in 2004, has become a reference work for the 9/11 Truth movement. In the same year, Griffin published the book The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions, in which he argues that flaws in the commission's report amounts to a cover-up by government officials and says that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> complicit in the 9/11 attacks. Griffin theorized in a June 2010 article that those in the alleged false flag operation wanted the buildings to fall straight down. If they had toppled over, they would have destroyed dozens of other buildings and killed tens of thousands of people.|$|E
25|$|Initially, McKinney kept a {{low profile}} upon her return to Congress. However, on July 22, 2005, {{the first anniversary of}} the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, McKinney held a {{briefing}} on Capitol Hill to address alleged outstanding issues regarding the 2001 attacks on the US. The day-long briefing featured family members of victims, scholars, former intelligence officers and others who critiqued the 9/11 Commission account of 9/11 and its recommendations. The four morning panels addressed flaws, omissions, and a lack of historical and political analysis in the commission's report. Three afternoon panels critiqued the commission's recommendations in the areas of foreign and domestic policy and intelligence reform. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial maintained that the purpose of the event was to discuss whether or not <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> involved in the 9/11 attacks, expressing surprise that McKinney was once again taking on the issue that was widely believed to have cost her House seat. The Journal-Constitution declined to publish McKinney's reply. The 9/11 Commission has sealed all the notes and transcripts of some 2,000 interviews, all the forensic evidence, and both classified and non-classified documents used in compiling its final report until January 2, 2009. McKinney's interest in 9/11 relates specifically to what she expresses as her opposition to excessive government secrecy, which she has challenged with numerous pieces of legislation.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E
