5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman <b>therapist</b> had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC <b>therapist</b> had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The <b>therapist</b> was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E

Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex <b>therapist</b> Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the numbers of patients with selected chronic diseases treated by rehabilitation <b>therapists</b> (physical <b>therapists,</b> occupational <b>therapists,</b> exercise <b>therapists</b> and podiatrists). The study was performed to get quantitative information on the degree to which rehabilitation <b>therapists</b> are experienced in the treatment of chronically ill patients. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed on several databases containing representative data on patients treated by rehabilitation <b>therapists.</b> Rates per 1000 patients in the populations of these rehabilitation <b>therapists</b> and 90 % confidence intervals were computed for patients with the following diagnoses: ischaemic heart diseases, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, headache syndromes, COPD/asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic back pain (the size of the latter group could only be assessed in physical therapy in primary care). Results: The largest group of chonically ill patients treated by physical <b>therapists</b> in primary care are patients with chronic back pain (82 per 1000). Stroke patients are the most common chronically ill patients treated by physical <b>therapists</b> in institutional care (157 per 1000) and by occupational <b>therapists</b> in institutional (358 per 1000) and noninstitutional care (246 per 1000). These <b>therapists</b> also see a variety of other chronically ill patients. Exercise <b>therapists</b> and podiatrists treat less patients with the selected chronic diseases. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the <b>therapist</b> actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife.

40|$|Background: Primary care (PC) is an {{emerging}} practice setting for occupational therapy; however, few occupational <b>therapists</b> currently practice {{in this setting}} due to barriers, including uncertainty about reimbursement {{and the role of}} occupational <b>therapists.</b> This pilot study aimed to determine if PC providers and occupational <b>therapists</b> are receptive to occupational <b>therapists</b> as integrated interprofessional PC team members if barriers to inclusion are addressed. Method: After a brief educational paragraph explaining potential occupational therapy contributions to PC teams, the participants accessed a link to survey questions regarding their personal level of receptiveness to occupational therapy in PC. The questions comprised Likert scale and open-ended answers. Results: Of the Likert scale responses, 94 %- 99 % provided by occupational <b>therapists</b> and 82 %- 97 % provided by PC providers indicated possibly or yes to the inclusion of occupational <b>therapists</b> on the PC team. The descriptive responses were primarily supportive. Discussion: The majority of the occupational <b>therapists</b> and PC providers surveyed indicated support for including occupational <b>therapists</b> in primary care.
