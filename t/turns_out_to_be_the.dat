5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me.

Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E

5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for Citizen Kane differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production.

The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character.

5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. The A.V.

He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show.

However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E
