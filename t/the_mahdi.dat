5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of {{evacuating}} the Egyptian garrison from Khartoum. He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to the forces of <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi,</b> and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> to threaten Egypt. He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi,</b> cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic. Khartoum was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived {{two days after the}} city had fallen and Gordon had been killed. Despite a short-lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon's death, Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, {{operating}} out of Khartoum, helped extricate many loyal civilians who remained in Sudan, but refused ultimately to abandon the city. Contrary to his orders, he retained a small force in Khartoum and determined to give battle with <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> before relinquishing control. Accordingly, Mahdist forces besieged Khartoum in March 1884, isolating the city {{from the outside world}} and placing a dire timer upon Gordon to surrender. After much delay, the British government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley that would rapidly follow the Nile to Khartoum. Wolseley's column arrived on 28 January 1885, two days after Khartoum had fallen and General Charles Gordon's head delivered to <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman was the posthumous son of Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah, who had proclaimed himself <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> or messianic redeemer of the Islamic {{faith in}} 1881, {{and died in}} 1885 {{a few months after}} his forces had {{captured}} Khartoum. A joint British and Egyptian force recaptured Sudan in 1898. At first, the British severely restricted Abd al-Rahman's movement and activity. However, he soon emerged as the Sayyid (leader) of the Ansar religious sect, supporters of the Mahdist movement.|$|E

5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{invited the}} Yemenite scholar Abd al-Rahman ibn Hurayn al-Jabri {{to come to}} Omdurman and make a study of Mahdism. Al-Jabri wrote a book {{covering}} {{the history of the}} movement and its justification in the hadith, essentially designed to glorify <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> and his son. Abd al-Rahman tried to publish the book in 1925–26, but the British confiscated the manuscript, which they considered to be highly seditious. To avoid publicity, they did not prosecute al-Jabri but quietly deported him.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> began to accumulate followers and soon presented a serious threat to the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the British intervened {{directly}} in 1883, <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> had set about conquering much of Sudan, at the time controlled by Egypt, and had won several critical victories that provided him great wealth and modern weaponry. Colonel William Hicks, British officer appointed commander of eight-thousand Egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train, was given the simple objective of crushing the insurrection. Colonel Hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming Mahdist force at the Battle of El Obeid. After this defeat, and facing immense financial difficulties in Egypt, the British government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected General Charles George Gordon to lead the evacuation effort, as thousands of civilians and pounds of equipment were to be withdrawn from outposts throughout Sudan.|$|E

In 1899 the government heard rumors that the family group was advocating a Mahdist revival and dispatched a military force to al-Shakaba. One account says the force attacked the family and followers, firing on them at random. Abd al-Rahman was badly wounded and his two elder brothers were killed. Another account says Muhammad Sharif and the two elder sons of <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> were arrested. There was a skirmish when an attempt was made to rescue them.

When <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> Army signed a cease-fire {{with the government and}} the Americans and the fighting stopped, Qais al-Khazali continued fighting, and during the battle Khazali was already issuing his own orders to militiamen without Muqtada al-Sadr's approval. The group's leadership (which includes Qais Khazali, Abd al-Hadi al-Darraji (a politician in Muqtada al-Sadr's Sadr Movement) and Akram al-Kaabi), however, reconciled with al-Sadr in mid-2005. In July 2006, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq was founded and became one of the Special Groups which operated more independently from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> Army. It became a completely independent organisation after <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> Army's disbanding after the 2008 Shi'a uprising. In November 2008 when Sadr created the Promised Day Brigade to succeed <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> Army, he asked AAH (and other Special Groups) to join, but they declined.|$|E

25|$|In Shiraz, on 22 May 1844, he {{encountered}} Sayyed ʿAli Muhammad Shirāzi, the Báb, who invited Mullá Husayn to his home. On that night Mullá Husayn {{told him that}} he was searching for the Promised Mahdi and shared with him some of the characteristics expected of <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> which he had learned from Siyyid Kázim. The Báb declared that he manifested all of the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi.</b> Mullá Husayn remained uncertain until the Báb had replied satisfactorily to all of Mullá Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary on the Surah of Joseph, which {{has come to be known}} as the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá' ("Maintainer of the Divine Names") and is considered the Báb's first revealed work. Siyyid Kázim had apparently—when requested by Mullá Husayn to do so himself—predicted that <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> would reveal, unasked, a commentary on this Surah. Nabil's Narrative records Mullá Husayn's account of the signs he had been given by the dying Siyyid Kázim to recognize <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> and indicates that Mullá Husayn was quickly convinced that the Báb satisfied these conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mahdi</b> Army {{occasionally}} shelled the Green Zone, {{the central}} seat of Coalition power in Iraq, with mortars and rockets from the district. These attacks stopped when US Army attack helicopters destroyed a rocket team and US Army artillery annihilated a mortar team.

25|$|From {{the start}} <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> {{was focused on}} {{expansion}} eastward, and he soon attacked Egypt with a Fatimid army of Kotama Berbers led by his son, once in 914, and again in 919, both times quickly taking Alexandria but then losing to the Abbasids. Probing for weakness, <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi</b> then sent an invasion westward, but his forces met with mixed results. Many Sunnis, including the Umayyad Caliph of al-Andalus and the Zenata Berber kingdom in Morocco, effectively opposed {{him because of his}} Ismaili Shi'a affiliation. <b>The</b> <b>Mahdi</b> did not follow Maliki law, but taxed harshly, incurring further resentment. His capital Mahdiya was more a fort than a princely city. The Maghrib was disrupted, being contested between the Zenata and the Sanhaja favoring the Fatimids.|$|E

25|$|Gordon's {{ideas on}} Sudan were radically {{different}} from Gladstone's: he believed that <b>the</b> <b>Mahdi's</b> rebellion had to be defeated, or he might {{gain control of the}} whole of Sudan, and from there sweep over Egypt.

Gordon favoured an aggressive policy in Sudan, in agreement with noted imperialists such as Sir Samuel Baker and Sir Garnet Wolseley, and his opinions were published in The Times in January 1884.|$|R
