40|$|Abstract: Pahutoxin a {{quaternary}} ammonium salt surfactant {{serves as an}} active ingredient in the defensive skin secretion of various marine <b>trunkfish</b> (Ostracociidae). In the defensive skin secretion of the Red Sea <b>trunkfish,</b> Ostracion cubicus the effect of PHN is amplified due {{to the existence of}} non toxic polypeptides which act as (a) PHN ± chelators and (b) potentiators. The secretion of the Red Sea <b>trunkfish</b> includes an additional category of pharmacologically active polypeptides represented by boxin [7] which similarly to PHN they independently kill fish exclusively through medium application. By the aid of radiolabeled PHN and a fish gill membrane preparation a series of equilibrium saturation binding assays were carry out which demonstrate that PHN performs its biological defensive function via receptors and not due to its surface activity. The gill membranes of the <b>trunkfish</b> were shown to be devoid of PHNreceptors. The pharmacological, ecological and environmental implications of the above data are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Ostracion cyanurus {{is known}} as bluetail <b>trunkfish,</b> bluetail boxfish, Arabian Boxfish and Arabian <b>Trunkfish.</b> The family that this fish belongs to is called the boxfish family. Origin of this fish is Western Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. O. cyanurus Inhabits areas of {{moderate}} coral growth, it’s Solitary and found close to shelter. O. cyanurus has a unique square shape and a particular way of swimming. They have a rather special personality, which one quickly comes to love. We report from Iranian Waters (Persian Gulf, Kish Island). Maximum length is 15 cm in Kish Island. They found at depths of from 2 to 8 m (in Kish Island, Iran). They live typically off a mixture of algae, coral polyps, zooplankton, {{and in some cases}} crustaceans. They are not normally reef safe and when small will require gentle water circulation. This species has a toxin in its skin, which it releases when highly stressed or dying. This poison can kill all the aquatic life in the aquarium, if unlucky. Bluetail <b>trunkfish</b> can grow up to 15 cm...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{bases for}} {{the stability of}} locomotory motions in fishes are poorly understood, even for those fishes, such as the rigid-bodied smooth <b>trunkfish</b> Lactophrys triqueter, that exhibit unusually small amplitude recoil movements during rectilinear swimming. We have studied {{the role played by}} the bony carapace of the smooth <b>trunkfish</b> in generating trimming forces that self-correct for instabilities. The flow patterns, forces and moments on and around anatomically exact, smooth <b>trunkfish</b> models positioned at both pitching and yawing angles of attack were investigated using three methods: digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), pressure distribution measurements, and force balance measurements. Models positioned at various pitching angles of attack within a flow tunnel produced well-developed counter-rotating vortices along the ventro-lateral keels. The vortices developed first at the anterior edges of the ventro-lateral keels, grew posteriorly along the carapace, and reached maximum circulation at the posterior edge of the carapace. The vortical flow increased in strength as pitching angles of attack deviated from 0 °, and was located above the keels at positive angles of attack and below them at negative angles of attack. Variation of yawing angles of attack resulted in prominent dorsal and ventral vortices developing at far-field locations of the carapace; far-field vortices intensified posteriorly and as angles of attack deviated from 0 °. Pressure distribution results were consistent with the DPIV findings, with areas of low pressure correlating well with regions of attached, concentrated vorticity. Lift coefficients of boxfish models were similar to lift coefficients of delta wings, devices that also generate lift through vortex generation. Furthermore, nose-down and nose-up pitching moments about the center of mass were detected at positive and negative pitching angles of attack, respectively. The three complementary experimental approaches all indicate that the carapace of the smooth <b>trunkfish</b> effectively generates self-correcting forces for pitching and yawing motions — a characteristic that is advantageous for the highly variable velocity fields experienced by <b>trunkfish</b> in their complex aquatic environment. All important morphological features of the carapace contribute to producing the hydrodynamic stability of swimming trajectories in this species...|$|R

50|$|The spotted <b>trunkfish</b> (Lactophrys bicaudalis) is {{a member}} of the family Ostraciidae. It can be found in reefs {{throughout}} the Caribbean, as well as the south eastern Atlantic Ocean. The species gets its name from the black spots it has covered over its yellow-golden body.|$|R
50|$|Naguabo {{is said to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the pastelillo de chapín, which is a popular food in Puerto Rico. It is <b>trunkfish</b> wrapped inside a flour dough that is deep fried. Pastelillo de chapín can be found in almost any seaside {{establishment}} on the island.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trunkfish</b> has small diffuse white spots. Two areas, {{located on}} the {{pectoral}} region and halfway between gills and posterior end of carapace, contain dark-edged hexagonal plates that together form chain-like markings. It can reach a length of 30-50 cm and weigh up to 3.3 kg.|$|R
50|$|The smooth <b>trunkfish</b> is {{normally}} solitary but sometimes moves around in small groups. It uses its protuberant lips to expel a {{jet of water}} which disturbs the sandy seabed and reveals any shallowly buried benthic invertebrates.

2500|$|The spotted <b>trunkfish</b> is a reef fish which secretes a {{colourless}} ciguatera toxin from glands on {{its skin}} when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there's no immediate harm to divers. However, predators {{as large as}} nurse sharks can die {{as a result of}} eating a <b>trunkfish.</b> [...] Ciguatera toxins appear to accumulate in top predators of coral reefs. [...] Many of the Caribbean groupers and the barracuda for example may contain enough of this toxin to cause severe symptoms in humans who eat them. [...] What makes the situation particularly dangerous is that such species may be toxic only at certain sizes or locations, making it difficult to know whether or when they are or are not safe to eat. In some locations this leads to many cases of ciguatera poisoning among tropical islanders.|$|R

Species are among the commonly consumed fishes from the reservoir. A total of 40 fish samples comprising 10 of each species were used for this work.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{colorful}} reef life {{is very close}} to the shore. One can see sections of beautiful boulder, fire, brain, and elkhorn coral. Spottings of both small and medium schools are fish are common. The fish close to the shore, visible while snorkeling, include: parrotfish, squirrelfish, <b>trunkfish,</b> trumpetfish, goatfish, grunt, and tang. There are also predator fish like the yellowtail snapper and the blue runner.|$|R
50|$|In some regions, {{the smooth}} <b>trunkfish</b> is caught for human consumption. It is also {{sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. Caution {{needs to be}} used however as it produces a toxic substance, ostracitoxin, in mucous secretions from the skin.

50|$|The {{subfamily}} Mormyrinae {{contains all}} but one of the genera of the African freshwater fish family Mormyridae in the order Osteoglossiformes. They live in muddy water. They are often called elephantfish due to a long protrusion below their mouths used to detect buried invertebrates that is suggestive of a tusk or trunk (some such as Marcusenius senegalensis gracilis are sometimes called <b>Trunkfish</b> though this term is usually associated with an unrelated group of fish). They can also be called tapirfish.|$|R
40|$|Boxfishes (Teleostei: Ostraciidae) are {{marine fishes}} having rigid carapaces that vary {{significantly}} among taxa in their shapes and structural ornamentation. We showed previously that the keels of the carapace of one species of tropical boxfish, the smooth <b>trunkfish,</b> produce leading edge vortices (LEVs) capable of generating self-correcting trimming forces during swimming. In this paper {{we show that}} other tropical boxfishes with different carapace shapes have similar capabilities. We conducted a quantitative study of flows around the carapaces of three morphologically distinct boxfishes (spotted boxfish, scrawled cowfish and buffalo <b>trunkfish)</b> using stereolithographic models and three separate but interrelated analytical approaches: digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), pressure distribution measurements, and force balance measurements. The ventral keels of all three forms produced LEVs that grew in circulation along the bodies, resembling the LEVs produced around delta-winged aircraft. These spiral vortices formed above the keels and increased in circulation as pitch angle became more positive, and formed below the keels and increased in circulation as pitch angle became more negative. Vortices also formed along the eye ridges of all boxfishes. In the spotted boxfish, which is largely trapezoidal in cross section, consistent dorsal vortex growth posterior to the eye ridge was also present. When all three boxfishes were positioned at various yaw angles, regions of strongest concentrated vorticity formed in far-field locations of the carapace compared with near-field areas, and vortex circulation was greatest posterior {{to the center of}} mass. In general, regions of localized low pressure correlated well with regions of attached, concentrated vorticity, especially around the ventral keels. Although other features of the carapace also affect flow patterns and pressure distributions in different ways, the integrated effects of the flows were consistent for all forms: they produce trimming self-correcting forces, which we measured directly using the force balance. These data together with previous work on smooth <b>trunkfish</b> indicate that body-induced vortical flows are a common mechanism that is probably significant for trim control in all species of tropical boxfishes...|$|R
50|$|Fishery {{is common}} in all coastal towns but Puerto Rico {{does not have enough}} wild {{fisheries}} to supply the demand required to sustain a profitable fishing industry. There are no industrial fish farms on the island either. Common fish consumed by residents include cod (bacalao), mahi-mahi (pez dorado), marlin (marlín), salmon (salmón), snapper (chillo), <b>trunkfish</b> (chapín), and tuna (atún). Other seafood includes clams (almejas), crabs (cangrejos), lobsters (langostas), mussels (mejillones), octopi (pulpo), oysters (ostras), and squids (calamares). It is quite common for restaurants on the coast to serve fresh seafood.|$|R
50|$|Masturus lanceolatus {{also known}} as the sharptail mola is a species of mola found circumglobally in {{tropical}} and temperate waters. It is similar in appearance to the ocean sunfish (Mola mola), but can be distinguished by the projection on its clavus (pseudo-tail). Other common names include sharpfin sunfish, point-tailed sunfish, and <b>trunkfish.</b> Rarely encountered, very little is known of the biology or life history of the sharptail mola. It has recently become important to commercial fisheries operating off eastern Taiwan. This species is the only member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|The U.S.V.I {{is home to}} 386 {{square miles}} of coral reefs, {{which is more than}} twice the archipelago’s total landmass and is a {{critical}} habitat for hundreds of tropical fish species and coral species. The coral reefs also provide habitat for mollusks, sea urchins, sea fans, sea anemones and sponges. Some of the coral species found here are the elkhorn coral, brain coral, pillar coral, staghorn coral, fire coral, sea whips, star coral and finger coral. Along the many coral reefs are also numerous crabs, lobsters, parrot fish, damselfish, goatfish, wrasse, triggerfish, <b>trunkfish,</b> trumpet fish, angelfish, squid, sea turtles and octopus.|$|R
50|$|It has {{distinctive}} {{features such as}} a scrawled pattern of bluish markings covering its body; a blue line runs from snout to anal fin {{and it has a}} pair of sharp spines above each eye, giving the name “cowfish” because they resemble the horns of a cow. This latter point distinguishes cowfish from <b>trunkfish.</b> Overall it is colored blue-green to yellow cast. However, it may darken, pale and change color. Significantly it has two sharp spines in front of anal fin. Pelvic fins and spiny dorsal fin are not found on the cowfish. Almost always there will be dark, blotchy spots along the body, and three to four horizontal lines on the cheek. They have usually less than fifteen teeth in each jaw.|$|R
40|$|A sunfish (or <b>trunkfish),</b> Ranzania typus, {{measuring}} 616 mm {{total length}} {{and a maximum}} depth of 310 mm was caught at Erayumanthurai on the southwest coast (Kanyakumari district, Tamil nadu) on 2 - 3 - 1984 in a shore seine. The gear had operated a distance of 1 km from the shore, up {{to a depth of}} 22 m. Coloured bluish, tending towards dark above and to silvery below, it had a smooth skin with small hexagonal plates. Six streaks of lighter colour with darker borders, emanated from near the dorsal margin between the snout and the gill slit, curved downwards to the ventral profile. The posterior three streaks were branched and contained dark spots, mostly round. Lips were produced forwards beyond teeth as a funnel, closing in a vertical slit...|$|R
50|$|The {{various members}} of this family are able to secrete {{cationic}} surfactants through their skin which {{can act as a}} chemical defense mechanism. An example of this is pahutoxin, a water-soluble, crystalline chemical toxin that is contained in mucus secreted from the skin of Ostracion lentiginosus {{and other members of the}} <b>trunkfish</b> family when they are under stress. Pahutoxin is a choline chloride ester of 3-acetoxypalmitic acid that behaves similarly to steroidal saponins found in echinoderms. When this toxic mucus is released from the fish, it quickly dissolves in the environment and negatively affects any fish in the surrounding area. It is possible since this toxin resembles certain detergents so closely, that adding these detergents as pollutants to seawater has potential to interfere with receptor-mediated processes in marine life.|$|R
50|$|The smooth <b>trunkfish</b> has an angular body {{sheathed}} in plate-like scales, growing {{to a maximum}} length of 47 cm, though 20 cm is a more normal size. The body is enclosed in a bony carapace and, when viewed from the front, is triangular in shape with a narrow top and wide base. The fish has a pointed snout with protuberant lips encircling a small mouth. The tail is shaped like a brush. The general background colour is dark with a pattern of small white spots, often in hexagonal groups giving a honeycomb-like appearance in the middle area of the body. The {{tip of the snout}} and the area round the pectoral fins are dark with few spots and the eyes are black. The fins are usually yellowish with a dark base and tips. They have only soft rays with no spines.|$|R
50|$|The dusky {{damselfish}} is a territorial species. It guards part of {{the seabed}} and repels intruders, sometimes chasing away fish several times its own size. The richer the site was in suitable algae for feeding, the more aggressive the fish became. Besides members of its own species, the main species chased away were parrotfish, bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus) and ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus bahianus). Certain other fish species, such as the smooth <b>trunkfish</b> (Rhinesomus triqueter) and the graysby (Cephalopholis cruentata), were not chased away. The author of the study surmised it was the food source rather than the geographical area being guarded, and these fish were {{not considered to be}} threats because they did not graze algae, instead feeding on small invertebrates. An alternative possibility was these fish benefited the dusky damselfish in some other way, such as by providing some protection against predators or by removing invertebrates that feed on algae.|$|R
