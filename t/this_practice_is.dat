5|$|In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are {{performed}} at Shakti temples, particular {{to mark the}} legend of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. This involves slaying of a goat, chicken or a male water buffalo. <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> rare among Hindus, outside this region.|$|E

5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} on domestic routes is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> Indonesia AirAsia, a branch of Malaysian AirAsia; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> not widespread.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{practice}} of writing and giving kvitelach began. <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> {{not mentioned in the}} writings of the early kabbalists, nor in the works of the school of Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the father of modern Kabbalah. The first time it is mentioned is {{during the time of the}} Baal Shem Tov (1698–1762), founder of Hasidism.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E

5|$|The coins {{are issued}} in €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c denominations. To avoid {{the use of}} the two {{smallest}} coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and Ireland (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law). <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> discouraged by the Commission, as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a much}} publicised {{practice}} of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> attributed to Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, (d. 1743). More than a million notes are placed each year {{and the opportunity to}} e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations. It has become customary for visiting dignitaries to place notes too.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, the Smarta {{tradition}} {{emphasizes that}} all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> to transition past {{the use of}} icons, recognize the Absolute symbolized by the icons, {{on the path to}} realizing the nondual identity of one's Atman (soul, self) and the Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, <b>this</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E

5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. <b>This</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> based on empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, {{who found that}} they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep stops have not been adequately validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E
