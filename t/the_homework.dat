In 1998, the Bangalter side project Stardust experimented with the band wearing reflective costumes in their music video.

500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about <b>the</b> <b>homework</b> in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E

As tarefas de casa, que se constituem em uma prática comum no contexto escolar, também merecem destaque neste momento para que não tenha apenas um caráter figurativo na ação pedagógica, mas que possam valorizar e promover a aprendizagem de todos os alunos, entre eles, aqueles com deficiência intelectual.

Methods: A qualitative study with parents of children aged 9 – 10 years was conducted to identify possible methods to involve them in a school-based obesity prevention intervention, followed by a process evaluation of homework and school newsletters to involve parents. Results: Qualitative study: parents supported <b>the</b> use of <b>homework</b> and school newsletters to involve them and overcome the main barriers of their work and time. Process evaluation: Ten homeworks and inserts for the school newsletter about the obesity prevention intervention were developed and delivered. <b>The</b> majority of <b>homeworks</b> were given out (73 %), completed by children (84 %) and recalled by parents (60 – 68 %). <b>The</b> majority of <b>homeworks</b> were enjoyed by parents and children.

Students had the option of submitting homework online, where it was corrected by the lecturer using an elaborate coloured correction scheme, incorporating corrective feedback and comments of guidance and praise. The students and lecturer also had the ability to communicate online using comments. <b>The</b> Online German <b>Homework</b> Wiki also stored class handouts and class pages in which the lecturer documented all white-board work on vocabulary and discussion topics as they happened in class, thus contextualising vocabulary. Key to the learning process, however, was the feature of hyperlinking, which involved the teacher underlining errors and hyperlinking them to other pages explaining the grammatical or idiomatic aspect, thus contextualising grammar. The investigation involved developing testing methods to establish students’ language level in the pre-study and post-study phases. Questionnaires were devised to collect background information and feedback from students and also feedback from lecturers at SCHM and at other institutes. The investigation found that students’ engagement with <b>the</b> Online <b>Homework</b> Wiki was solely affected by students’ attendance, motivation and attitude towards learning German, IT skills and the frequency of the lecturer’s feedback.
