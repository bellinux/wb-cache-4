5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed <b>that</b> <b>up</b> by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, a {{third of}} Poland's {{population}} was composed of ethnic minorities. Poland had about 35 million inhabitants in 1939, but fewer than 24 million in 1946, within the respective borders. Of the remaining population over three million were ethnic minorities, such as Germans, Ukrainians and Jews, most of whom would soon leave Poland. Poland suffered the heaviest proportionate human losses during World War II, amounting to 16–17 percent of its population. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to 6 million Polish citizens died from war-related causes between 1939 and 1945. The approximate figure includes 3 million Jewish-Polish victims {{as part of the}} above total. The number of ethnically Polish victims was perhaps 2 million.|$|E
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Myanmar {{where the}} storm moved ashore, and winds of 157km/h (98mph) were reported. Widespread areas reported winds of 40km/h (25mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State, causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite imagery {{in the days}} following the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
5|$|Estimates show <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to 500,000people {{living in}} the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars {{pose a threat to}} the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E
