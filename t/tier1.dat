2500|$|To {{accomplish}} these steps, USPACOM {{adopted a}} methodology that focuses its CIP efforts on <b>Tier1</b> assets. Tier 1 assets are assets {{that could cause}} mission failure if they are compromised or damaged. [...] The methodology UAPACOM adopted and modified is Mission Area Analysis, or MAA. [...] The MAA links combatant command missions to infrastructure assets that are critical to a given Operations Plan, or OPLAN, Contingency Plan, or CONPLAN, or Crisis Action Plan. Typically, the MAA process determines the assessment site priorities. [...] USPACOM modified the process and selected the CIP assessment sites and installations prior to conducting the MAA. [...] The following is an illustration of the USPACOM MAA process: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{primary purpose}} of the Mitigation phase is to {{minimize}} the operational impact on other critical Defense Infrastructures and assets when a critical asset is lost or damaged. As an example, if there is a U.S. installation, SiteA, located in a host nation. SiteA is a <b>tier1</b> asset, meaning that if it fails, the Combatant Commands mission fails. [...] SiteA has mutual Global Information Grid Command Control (GIG/C2), information interdependencies with SitesB and C. [...] In addition, other Defense Infrastructure sectors rely on SiteA for mission capabilities. [...] In this scenario, what could be the impact if the supply line to the commercial power plant that provides the installation’s primary power is accidentally severed. [...] Because of all the interdependencies, losing this asset is more than the loss of just one site. It means the loss of other sector capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Nordic Data Grid Facility traces {{its history}} back to end-2001, being {{intrinsically}} {{related to the}} NorduGrid project. Success of the latter indicated need for a larger pan-Nordic facility, with storage resources being of high priority. This need has been addressed by establishing a pilot NDGF infrastructure, which was operational in 2002-2005, and provided distributed storage {{in addition to the}} NorduGrid computing resources. During this phase, NDGF committed to provide a Nordic <b>Tier1</b> (regional computing center) for the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid project at CERN. Specifics of this <b>Tier1</b> are such {{that it has to be}} an internationally distributed Facility. The Nordic Data Grid Facility in its present function as a provider of the Nordic Grid Infrastructure was established in April 2006 by the Nordic Research Councils. It came into operation on June 1, 2006, and its initial priority is to live up to the original commitment of establishing the Nordic <b>Tier1,</b> with the traditional focus on storage facilities. NDGF team includes software experts who take part in various Grid middleware development.|$|E

50|$|GridPP is a {{collaboration}} of particle physicists and computer {{scientists from the}} United Kingdom and CERN. They manage and maintain a distributed computing grid across the UK with the primary aim of providing resources to particle physicists working on the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN. They are funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council. The collaboration oversees a major computing facility called the <b>Tier1</b> at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) along with the four Tier 2 organisations of ScotGrid, NorthGrid, SouthGrid and LondonGrid (formerly LT2). The Tier 2s are geographically distributed and are composed of computing clusters at multiple institutes.|$|E
