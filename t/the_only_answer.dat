5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E
25|$|The NH {{had been}} making up any {{shortfall}} {{in the ability of}} the NYW to meet its debt obligations. Thus, when the NH entered bankruptcy in 1935, the NYW did as well. Former New Haven General Manager Clinton L. Bardo was appointed as Trustee to try to turn around the fortunes of the ailing Westchester. But the trustees of the NH bankruptcy and the trustees of the NYW bankruptcy were responsible to different groups of creditors. The liquidation brought them into conflict. The NYW was forced to cease operating on the Port Chester line to enhance the revenues of the NH from its parallel service. The loss of revenue could not be offset by lower costs. If the NYW had been left intact, it would have required the New Haven to pay off a bond issue that was due in 1946. Total liquidation was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer.</b> Bardo {{died of a heart attack}} in August 1937, before the full effect of his policies could be realized. The NYW ceased operations on December 31, 1937.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|Zoe Detsi-Diamanti, in {{her book}} The Flesh Made Text Made Flesh, commented on the episode's {{depiction}} of race. She argues that the episode {{makes the point that}} a [...] "perfectly normal" [...] black man looks a certain way, pointing out that the episode states that a black man is defined by a [...] "certain skin pigment". Any exception to this norm is depicted in a negative manner, with science being <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> to unnatural phenomena. Dean Kowalski agreed with the analysis in The Philosophy of The X-Files, commenting that one of the main themes of the episodes revolved around science's attempt to explain folk theories and paranormal phenomena. The episode's antagonist Aboah, escapes the FBI by fitting into a dinner cart, a feat that was compared to slaves escaping in unconformable slave ships.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{have stated}} that Man of Steel is a {{religious}} allegory, especially since Warner Bros. set up a website www.manofsteelresources.com that contains [...] "a nine-page pamphlet entitled Jesus – The Original Superhero". Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the passion of Christ, stating that [...] "Kal-El is {{more than willing to}} sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth. Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Supes decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation." [...] Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within Man of Steel: [...] "Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation. Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, like Jesus, 'He’ll be a god to them.'" [...] Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that [...] "Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross," [...] a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film. The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks [...] "counsel at a church." [...] Writing for The Huffington Post, Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler, citing, [...] "He feels his vision for a pure Krypton (i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program) is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> for survival." ...|$|E

Andrews said {{the government}} had acquired the consortium for $1. The decision was condemned by Abbott as [...] "reckless" [...] and said Victorians would suffer as a result. Abbott said: [...] "The East West Link is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer.</b> Tens {{of millions of dollars}} and years of planning have already been invested to get the project shovel-ready. $3 billion from the Commonwealth government remains on the table for any Victorian government which wants to build the East West Link." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1986, {{astrophysics}} professor Fang Lizhi, who {{had returned}} from a tenure at Princeton University, began a personal tour around universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and separation of powers. Fang {{was part of a}} wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment as well as the disaster of the Cultural Revolution was the direct result of an authoritarian political system and the rigid planned economy that came with it. The view that political reform was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal amongst students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country. [...] In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.|$|E

2500|$|Ironside {{himself was}} sent to France in May 1940 to liaise with the BEF and the French {{in an attempt to}} halt the German advance. He was not well-qualified for this task, having a deep dislike and {{distrust}} for the French, whom he considered [...] "absolutely unscrupulous in everything". At a conference in Lens he clashed with the French Generals Billotte and Blanchard, whom he considered defeatists. He wrote: [...] "I lost my temper and shook Billotte by the button of his tunic. The man is completely defeated." [...] Although Billotte was supposed to be co-ordinating the British, French and Belgian armies' operations in Belgium, Ironside took over the job himself, ordering Gort and Blanchard to launch a counter-attack against the Germans at Arras. This attack achieved some local success, but the German onslaught proved unstoppable. The French Commander-in-Chief, General Weygand, so resented Ironside's actions that he said he would [...] "like to box Ironside's ears." [...] Ironside, despairing of the French Army's willingness to fight, accepted Gort's view that evacuation of the BEF was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, at the {{suggestion}} of Gloria Steinem, his friend the political essayist Noel Parmentel and others, he ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic Party primary for Mayor of New York City, allied with columnist Jimmy Breslin (who ran for City Council President), proposing the creation of a 51st state through New York City secession. Although Mailer took stands {{on a wide range of}} issues, from opposing [...] "compulsory fluoridation of the water supply" [...] to advocating the release of Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton, decentralization was the overriding issue of the campaign. Mailer [...] "foresaw the city, its independence secured, splintering into townships and neighborhoods, with their own school systems, police departments, housing programs, and governing philosophies". Their slogan was [...] "throw the rascals in". Mailer was endorsed by libertarian economist Murray Rothbard, who [...] "believed that 'smashing the urban government apparatus and fragmenting it into a myriad of constituent fragments' offered <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> to the ills plaguing American cities," [...] and called Mailer's campaign [...] "the most refreshing libertarian political campaign in decades". He came in fourth in a field of five. Looking back on the campaign, journalist and historian Theodore White called it [...] "one of the most serious campaigns run in the United States in the last five years[...] [...] [...] is campaign was considered and thoughtful, the beginning of an attempt to apply ideas to a political situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even when I know he is absolutely <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>answer</b> to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in the way they used to, and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E
