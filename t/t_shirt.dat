2500|$|Duke Latin American studies {{professor}} Ariel Dorfman hypothesizes that Che's been [...] "comfortably transmogrified into {{a symbol}} of rebellion" [...] precisely because those in power no longer believe him to be dangerous. Dorfman suspects the attempt to subvert Che could backfire, positing that 3billion people now live on less than $2 a day and thus [...] "the powerful of the earth should take heed: deep inside that <b>T</b> <b>shirt</b> where {{we have tried to}} trap him, the eyes of Che Guevara are still burning with impatience." [...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography. In his example, corporations in their desperate drive to sell goods, create the opportunity for observers to see the [...] "logo" [...] and ask [...] "who was that guy?" [...] Trisha Ziff, curator of Che!

In Ziff's view, despite the endless array of merchandising, the symbol of Che will continue to be worn and have resonance. Critical pedagogical theorist Peter McLaren theorizes that American capitalism is responsible for the Che phenomenon, stating that [...] "the United States has a seductive way of incorporating anything that it can't defeat and transforming that 'thing' into a weaker version of itself, much like the process of diluting the strength and efficacy of a virus through the creation of a vaccine." [...] Neo-Marxist and critical theorist Herbert Marcuse argued that in the contemporary capitalist world there is no escaping such co-optation, theorizing that we are made [...] "one-dimensional" [...] by capitalism's single-minded orientation toward greed and growth. Author Susan Sontag spoke of the potential positive ramifications of utilizing Che as a symbol, positing: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>T</b> <b>Shirt</b> is a 1976 album by Loudon Wainwright III. Unlike {{his earlier}} records, this (and the {{subsequent}} Final Exam) saw Wainwright adopt a full blown rock band (Slowtrain) - {{though there are}} acoustic songs on <b>T</b> <b>Shirt,</b> including a talking blues.
