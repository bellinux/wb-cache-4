40|$|We {{report an}} {{investigation}} into factors limiting the functional lifetime of multilayer piezoceramic actuators. The study consists {{of a combination of}} lifetime experiments by means of an accelerated lifetime <b>test,</b> <b>inspection</b> of the actuator microstructure at different stages of the accelerated lifetime test, and numerical simulation of the displacements and mechanical stresses that arise during actuator performance. During the lifetime test, both displacement and electrical properties were measured. The results show a clear correlation between the microstructure and the mechanical stresses in the actuator, giving evidence that crack initiation starts early in actuator lifetime and humidity effects accelerate degradation. The numerical simulations performed provide clues for optimization of the actuator design with respect to stress development and performance. Attention is paid to the choice of adhesive interlayer and its effect on the performance and lifetime of the actuator. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

40|$|Many industrialized economies {{have seen}} a {{relative}} increase of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) compared with large companies since the 1980 s.

This paper examines the role of the Japanese public testing and research (PTR) centres (kosetsu shiken kenkyu kikan), which have been proposed as a model for other countries. The paper traces the backgrounds and general activities of the PTR centres, an subsequently focuses on how PTR centres have assisted SMEs in the vicinity of Japan's five large car makers. It is found that in 1986 the PTR centre near Toyota's main assembly facilities performed the largest number of <b>test</b> <b>inspection</b> of SMEs in Japan, indicating that the Toyota production system relies to an extraordinary degree upon certification by a PTR centre.

40|$|Due to {{potential}} {{impact on the}} SSC performances, the identification of ageing effects and implementation of appropriate methods for mitigation of these effects becomes {{in the last years}} an important preoccupation of many organizations and research activities. The efforts deployed for developing time-dependent reliability models for all SSC may be considerable and may outweigh the benefits, but are not always necessary, mainly because in some cases, the maintenance, <b>test,</b> <b>inspection</b> and surveillance methods are good provision to mitigate the ageing effects. To efficiently use the limited resources, it is necessary to identify and prioritize the SSC that need time-dependent reliability models using specific criteria. This paper contributes to the effort of performing an efficient process of ageing effects evaluation, using probabilistic safety assessment models.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the scaling of transversely loaded carbon/epoxy plates by utilizing ply-level scaling, or geometrically increasing {{the thickness of}} a ply. A scale factor of l= 2 was examined in scaling from 8 to 16 ply, 16 to 32 ply, and 32 to 64 ply laminates. The laminates were loaded until a sudden drop in the recorded load occurred. The specimens were then unloaded. Force-transverse displacement data was monitored for each test. Post <b>test</b> <b>inspection</b> included measuring dent depth, delamination area as seen by xrays and cross-sectional examination. The following conclusions are drawn from this experimental study. · Static indentation measurements of maximum load, maximum deflection and delamination area were more repeatable than dent depth. · Scaled values of load and displacement from smaller specimens were greater than those from full-scale specimens. The largest differences were in scaling from 8 ply to 16 ply specimens, which had a 35 % larger scaled load and 11 % larger scaled displacement. 1...|$|E

The final operational system must satisfy the original requirements, though many verifications should be performed during the process. The verification methods that are used are <b>test,</b> <b>inspection,</b> analysis and demonstration. The plan for verification should be created once the system requirements are documented. The plan should include assurances that every requirement is formally verified, that the methods and the responsible organizations are specified, and that the plan is reviewed by all parties.

40|$|Test {{methods were}} {{developed}} to view global and local deformation in a composite tube during a test in which the tube is rotating at speeds and torques relevant to rotorcraft shafts. Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to provide quantitative displacement measurements during the tests. High speed cameras {{were used for the}} DIC measurements in order to capture images at sufficient frame rates and with sufficient resolution while the tube was rotating at speeds up to 5, 000 rpm. Surface displacement data was resolved into cylindrical coordinates in order to measure rigid body rotation and global deformation of the tube. Tests were performed on both undamaged and impact damaged tubes in order to evaluate the capability to detect local deformation near an impact damaged site. Measurement of radial displacement clearly indicated a local buckling deformation near the impacted site in both dynamic and static tests. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to investigate variations in fiber architecture within the composite tube and to detect impact damage. No growth in the impact damage area was observed by DIC during dynamic testing or by x-ray CT in post <b>test</b> <b>inspection</b> of the composite tube...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Northwest Laboratory is {{conducting}} a four-phase program for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness and reliability of in-service inspection (lSI} performed on the primary system piping welds of commercial light water reactors (LWRs). Phase I {{of the program is}} complete. A survey was made of the state of practice for ultrasonic rsr of LWR primary system piping welds. Fracture mechanics calculations were made to establish required nondestrutive testing sensitivities. In general, it was found that fatigue flaws less than 25 % of wall thickness would not grow to failure within an inspection interval of 10 years. However, in some cases failure could occur considerably faster. Statistical methods for predicting and measuring the effectiveness and reliability of lSI were developed and will be applied in the "Round Robin Inspections" of Phase II. Methods were also developed for the production of flaws typical of those found in service. Samples fabricated by these methods wilI be used in Phase II to <b>test</b> <b>inspection</b> effectiveness and reliability. Measurements were made of the influence of flaw characteristics {i. e., roughness, tightness, and orientation) on inspection reliability.
