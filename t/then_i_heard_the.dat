2500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> tatatatatatatatatat sound. I {{thought it}} was fireworks. An eerie sound fell over the common. The quiet felt like gravity pulling us to the ground. Then a young man's voice: [...] "They fucking killed somebody!" [...] Everything slowed down and the silence got heavier.|$|E
2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> boy's voice once more.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> porter's voice again. He evidently was guiding someone {{through the}} car.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the cabin at last, and arter {{lighting}} the lamp I ’ad another sup o’ the skipper’s whisky to clear my ’ead, and sat down to try and think wot tale I was to tell ’im. I sat for pretty near three hours without thinking of one, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> <b>the</b> crew come on to the wharf.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this went}} {{on for a long time}} till my voice was getting exhausted. <b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> baboons outside raise a loud noise, as they do when they are angry. <b>Then,</b> dear, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> boom of your elephant gun, and I think it was the sweetest sound that ever came to my ears. Hendrika heard it too. She sprang up, stood for a moment, then, to my horror, swept Tota into her arms and rushed down the cave. Of course I could not stir to follow her, for my feet were tied. Next instant <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of a rock being moved, and presently the lessening of the light in the cave told me that I was shut in. Now the sound even of the elephant gun only reached me very faintly, and presently I could hear nothing more, straining my ears as I would.|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes {{may have}} passed, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> clatter of many steps, and {{a knot of}} men came {{clustering}} through the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> slow, {{deliberate}} sound creeping {{towards me}} again. Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching {{against the walls}} and tapping the furniture.|$|E
60|$|But now, to my chagrin, I saw {{the sails}} on the {{schooner}} being lowered. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> captain give the command {{to lower the}} boat.|$|E
6000|$|Blest day! <b>Then</b> first <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> voice [...] That since hath oft beguiled [...] These {{eyes from}} tears, and bid rejoice [...] This heart with anguish wild-- [...] Thy mother, boy, thou hast not known; [...] So soon {{she left me}} here to moan-- [...] Left me to weep and watch, alone, [...] Our one beloved child.|$|R
60|$|Fred's {{door was}} shut, and I {{could hear him}} snoring. I {{scratched}} gently, and <b>then</b> harder, till <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> snores stop. He {{got out of bed}} and opened the door.|$|R
5000|$|Also in the ningyō jōruri [...] "Dan no Ura Kabuto Gunki" [...] (壇浦兜軍記) first {{performed}} in 1732, {{there was also}} [...] "it was quite clear weather {{all the way up}} to now, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it, <b>the</b> playful rain of the fox's wedding" [...] and in the period novel Onihei Hankachō published after the war, there was one volume titled [...] "fox rain" [...] (狐雨).|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> swish of {{erecting}} ears [...] Which caught that enchanted strain. [...] The ocean {{was swollen}} with storms of tears [...] That {{fell from the}} shining swain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ’eard this chap say something," [...] said Steve slowly, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> skipper’s voice. But I don’t like {{to repeat}} wot ’e said, I reely don’t." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went down}} the passage, {{and stood in the}} open doorway looking out into the night. It seemed a long time. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> thin voice of the old woman {{at the top of the}} stairs: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{never told}} any one; {{that is quite}} certain. But it shows how his mind must have been at work. Perhaps what I said may have had some effect at last. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>the</b> Cantors {{what they had been}} asked to do. I need not tell you all that <b>I</b> felt <b>then.</b> It would have been better for him to send for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|They told me <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> haunted Red Room {{as one who}} bears a tale. [...] "We {{found you}} at dawn," [...] said he, [...] "and there was blood on your {{forehead}} and lips." ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{had gone}} a hundred yards and the house became {{concealed}} by trees, Bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again. We stopped within twenty yards of the house, concealed by the dark shadows. I wondered at this maneuver. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> in <b>the</b> distance coming down the road beyond the house, the regular hoofbeats {{of a team of}} horses. Bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight.|$|R
60|$|But just <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> harsh {{music of}} rusty chains and bolts, a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood before me! I gasped with surprise; my breath almost {{got away from}} me.|$|E
60|$|They {{were now}} right close to me, and, half in fear, half in hope, I began to stir and rustle in the grass, for of my stifled groaning had {{hitherto}} come no profit. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> horses stop.|$|E
6000|$|I was falling, but I {{never reached}} the grass. Came a blurr of {{flashing}} lights, a thunder in my ears, a darkness, a glimmering of dim light slowly dawning, a wrenching, racking pain beyond all describing, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> voice {{of one who}} said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For one thing, the Colonel {{must have}} lost a good deal since wheat began to go down. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{something}} about <b>the</b> failure of an English bank; Lance once told me the family had shares in it. I expect the stoppage {{made a difference in}} their income." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Then,</b> as <b>I</b> have <b>heard,</b> <b>the</b> work of {{constructing}} a buildingWas proclaimed to many a tribe throughout this middle earth.In time—quickly, as such things happen among men—It was all ready, {{the biggest of}} halls.He whose word was lawFar and wide gave it the name [...] "Heorot".|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, Butler told Week In Rewind about landing {{his role}} in Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure: [...] "I had worked with Ashley once, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> about <b>the</b> movie, because she called me and said, 'Austin, I {{want you to come}} and read for the {{director}} for this--I think you'd be perfect.' So, I went and met with the director, and it went really well, and I ended up doing the movie." [...] The film wrapped production in July 2010 and was released direct-to-DVD on April 19, 2011.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} horses being brought around, and {{laughter}} and voices. How easily I distinguished hers! <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> hoof-beats {{on the soft}} dirt of the drive. Then silence,--the silence of a summer morning which is all myriad sweet sounds. Then Lindy appeared, starched and turbaned.|$|E
60|$|There {{was some}} {{disturbance}} as this man {{passed to the}} front. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> line move forward. Presently they were going by the wall within {{a foot or two}} of me. Indeed by ill-luck just as we were opposite to each other the captain stumbled and fell against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! it is true, <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> report {{some weeks}} ago, but hoped {{that it was}} not true. I am sorry for you, Ned. I know it must be a sore trial for you; it is always so when any one steps into the place of one we have loved and lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you were. You had got the kernel yourself, {{and thought}} that I had taken all the trouble to crack the nut and had found myself with nothing but the shell. Then, when you found you couldn't eat the kernel, that you couldn't {{get rid of the}} swag without assistance, you came to me to help you. I began to think then that you were too many for all of us. By Jove, <b>I</b> did! <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>the</b> second robbery, and, of course, I thought you had managed that too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Practical is the word," [...] said he, {{with another}} hateful chuckle. And <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> amidst <b>the</b> {{roar of the}} storm, the creak and whine of the winch-handle turning and the rattle of the grating as it passed through the slot. Great God, he was letting loose the Brazilian cat! ...|$|R
60|$|The black grumbled {{something}} that I could not understand, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him unlocking <b>the</b> door {{into one of}} the other cells on the further side. Listening intently, I caught the sound as the door closed behind him. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> sprang once more {{to the top of the}} partition and dropped into my own cell beside the astonished Xodar.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{handle of}} the door moving: I suppose Bertha had heard from the women {{that they had been}} dismissed: {{probably}} a vague fear had arisen in her mind, for she entered with a look of alarm. She came {{to the foot of the}} bed and gave a stifled cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{been able}} to sleep at all, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> rabbit, and couldn't help {{thinking}} of what it suffered, till I felt I must come down and kill it! But I am so glad you got there first... They {{ought not to be}} allowed to set these steel traps, ought they!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> hounds below me. I had {{but time}} to see the {{character}} of the place--long, yellow promontories running out and slopes of weathered stone reaching up between to a level with the rim--when in a dwarf pine growing just over the edge I caught sight of a long, red, pantherish body.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{mentioned}} a street, {{the name of}} which <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>heard</b> for <b>the</b> first time. All he could say, when I asked for further particulars, was that he lived close by the river--in which direction, he was too confused and too frightened {{to be able to}} tell me.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{beautiful}} autumn afternoon, and the wind had entirely died away. When I came within sight of our old home, it presented a doleful appearance. The bow had drifted out into the river, and was almost entirely under water. The stern stuck up in a mournful and ridiculous manner, with its keel, instead of its broadside, presented to the view of persons on the shore. As I neared <b>the</b> boat <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a voice. <b>I</b> stopped and listened. There {{was no one in}} sight. Could the sounds come from the boat? I concluded that it must be so, and I walked up closer. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> distinctly <b>the</b> words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a school of mullet before I'd been rowing five minutes. Fine big fat ones they were, and I could smell them over the fire. When I stood up, fire-stick in one hand, {{dynamite}} stick in the other, my knees were knocking together. Maybe it was the gin, or the anxiousness, or the weakness and the hunger, and {{maybe it was the}} result of all of them, but at any rate I was all of a shake. Twice I failed to touch the fire-stick to <b>the</b> dynamite. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> match-head splutter, and let her go.|$|R
