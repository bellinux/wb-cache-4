It is noteworthy that Neoproterozoic-Lower Cambrian felsic and mafic magmatism is recorded in many of the so-called “Cadomian blocks” present from the Iberia, Pyrenees, Western Alps to Turkey (e.g. Neubauer 2002; Stedra et al. 2002; Castiñeiras et al. 2008; Fernàndez-Suarez et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|Between the AAD and the Amsterdam and St. Paul islands, {{spreading}} rate is constant at 69-75 mm/yr while axial depth increases {{by more than}} 2300 m. This has been interpreted as an eastward decrease in mantle temperature of perhaps 100 °C caused by a magma flow from the Kerguelen-ASP hotspots to the AAD 'cold spot' at 120-128°E. Located at 126°E, the AAD would thus mark the 40 km-long transition between Indian Ocean and Pacific MORBs (mid-ocean ridge basalts), a boundary that has been migrating westward during the past <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>million</b> years.|$|R
