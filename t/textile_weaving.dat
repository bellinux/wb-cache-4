5|$|<b>Textile</b> <b>weaving,</b> leather-work and gem cutting {{are some}} of the {{important}} crafts practised in Tiruchirappalli. Wooden idols of Hindu gods and goddesses are sold at Poompuhar, the crafts emporium run by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The Trichy Travel Federation (TTF) was formed on 5 May 2009 to promote Tiruchirappalli as a favourable tourist destination. The federation organises an annual food festival called Suvai. Lack of infrastructure has been a major deterrent to the city's tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq.|$|E

Many of the <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> mills that used to punctuate the landscape have been demolished {{to make way for}} new retail outlets and modern housing. Others lie semi-derelict, but the best examples continue to provide jobs for local residents by accommodating new manufacturing and service businesses. Strong growth has been experienced in precision engineering, particularly associated with the aerospace sector, as Rolls-Royce Aerospace operates a large wide chord fan-blade manufacturing facility in nearby Barnoldswick.|$|E

An inoperative sugar mill still stands in Rampur; it was closed down in 1999 amidst political rivalry, but work has since begun on restarting the mill after state government approval.

25|$|In 2013, a {{group from}} the University of Tokyo {{developed}} cell laden fibers up to a meter in length and {{on the order of}} 100µm in size. These fibers were created using a microfluidic device that forms a double coaxial laminar flow. Each 'layer' of the microfluidic device (cells seeded in ECM, a hydrogel sheath, and finally a calcium chloride solution). The seeded cells culture within the hydrogel sheath for several days, and then the sheath is removed with viable cell fibers. Various cell types were inserted into the ECM core, including myocytes, endothelial cells, nerve cell fibers, and epithelial cell fibers. This group then showed that these fibers can be woven together to fabricate tissues or organs in a mechanism similar to <b>textile</b> <b>weaving.</b> Fibrous morphologies are advantageous in that they provide an alternative to traditional scaffold design, and many organs (such as muscle) are composed of fibrous cells.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and hyperelastic modelling of orthotropic mechanical behavior of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> fabric. The strain energy {{function of the}} hyperelastic model {{is a combination of}} the warp extension, weft extension, and shear angle between warp and weft directions. The experimental and fitting analysis of the anisotropy is realized using off-axis tensile tests for five <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. Orthotropic hyperelastic modelling highlights the anisotropy tensile property of <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabric compared to orthotropic linear elastic modelling. Particular attention is given to the influence of weave structure on fabric anisotropy...|$|R
500|$|The spider has symbolized {{patience}} and persistence {{due to its}} hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for its prey to become ensnared. Numerous cultures attribute the spider's ability to spin webs with the origin of spinning, <b>textile</b> <b>weaving,</b> basketry, knotwork and net making. Spiders are associated with creation myths because they seem to weave their own artistic worlds. [...] Philosophers often use the spider's web as a metaphor or analogy; and today, terms such as the Internet or World Wide Web evoke the inter-connectivity of a spider web.|$|E
