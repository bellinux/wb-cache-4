5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E

50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate <b>the</b> <b>shoes,</b> one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. <b>The</b> leading <b>shoe</b> (closest to <b>the</b> front of the vehicle) is known as <b>the</b> primary <b>shoe.</b> <b>The</b> trailing <b>shoe</b> is known as <b>the</b> secondary <b>shoe.</b> Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward <b>the</b> <b>shoes,</b> forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, <b>the</b> brake <b>shoe</b> springs restore <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|R

5|$|Shoe polish is {{traditionally}} packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. Because {{the amount of}} shoe polish {{that needs to be}} applied is small, and <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients, such as naphtha, a large container would dry out before being fully used. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes.|$|E

5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. <b>The</b> <b>shoe</b> made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E

25|$|To give a {{concrete}} example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory {{is not only}} producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. <b>The</b> <b>shoes</b> are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, {{the value of the}} labor of the worker is the exchange-value of <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker’s labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of <b>the</b> <b>shoes,</b> and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.|$|R
5|$|C Clark {{still has}} its {{headquarters}} in Street, behind a frontage that includes the clock tower and water tower, but shoes are no longer manufactured there.

Despite strong concerns being voiced by local retailers at the time, the retail outlets have not led to a demise of the existing shops. <b>The</b> <b>Shoe</b> Museum provides information {{about the history of}} Clarks and footwear manufacture in general, and a selection of shop display showcards from the 1930s, the 1950s and the 1960s, and television advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{concealed}} shoes {{found to}} date {{are made of}} leather, but wooden clogs and rubber galoshes have also been reported, among others.

50|$|A wheel {{cylinder}} is a component in a drum brake system. It {{is located in}} each wheel and is usually positioned {{at the top of}} the wheel, above <b>the</b> <b>shoes.</b> Its function is to exert force onto <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> so as to bring them into contact with the drum and stop the vehicle with friction. The {{wheel cylinder}}s are usually connected to <b>the</b> <b>shoes</b> with small bird-beak shaped rods.|$|R

5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E

5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987.

Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> care industry.

5|$|Elizabeth I {{gave the}} chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, {{creating}} a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended {{with the onset of}} the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the cast of House were not established actors, with many having primarily only worked with Obayashi on his commercials and independent films. During the two-year waiting period to start filming House, Obayashi created several commercials and began casting the seven girls from models who were in his commercials. The most experienced members of the main cast were Kimiko Ikegami and Yōko Minamida. Obayashi was friends with Minamida who he filmed in commercials for Calpis. Ikegami was mostly working television and theater {{at the time and}} worried that taking the role of the older woman would {{have a negative effect on}} the roles she would be subsequently offered, but still agreed to play the part. The country music singer Kiyohiko Ozaki, who plays Mr. Togo in the film, was cast because he was friends with Obayashi through their shared hobby of horseback riding. Other roles were filled by members of the crew and their families; for example, Nobuhiko Obayashi's daughter Chigumi plays the little girl, and the film's production designer plays <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> maker.|$|E
