Allowing for the stratification of the surrounding soil and variable crosssection of the <b>tapered</b> <b>pile,</b> the pile-soil system is discretized into finite segments. By virtue of the complex stiffness transfer model to simulate the compacting effect, the complex stiffness of different soil segments surrounding the <b>tapered</b> <b>pile</b> is obtained. Then, substituting the complex stiffness into the vertical dynamic governing equation of <b>tapered</b> <b>pile,</b> the analytical solution of vertical dynamic impedance of <b>tapered</b> <b>pile</b> under vertical exciting force is derived {{by means of the}} Laplace technique and impedance function transfer method. Based on the presented solutions, the influence of compacting effect of surrounding soil on vertical dynamic impedance at the pile head is investigated within the low frequency range concerned in the design of dynamic foundation...|$|E

On the load-settlement curve during pile penetration, evidences of model tests showed the increase in end bearing behavior by tapered piles. The analytical spherical cavity expansion theory has been utilized to evaluate the end bearing capacity. In the proposed model, the effect of angle of tapering has been introduced to compute the end bearing capacity of tapered piles. The test results and proposed model show that the tapering angle affects the end bearing resistance comparing with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{mechanism}} of <b>tapered</b> <b>piles</b> and evidence obtained from small scale model tests, this paper proposes cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion theories to evaluate the skin friction by introducing a stress–dilatancy relationship, as well as the end bearing capacity of <b>tapered</b> <b>piles</b> by introducing a tapering factor. In general, in order to evaluate the skin friction, either the angle of internal friction or dilatancy angle is assumed to be constant. This research improves on this drawback and considers both properties to calculate the skin friction through an iterative process in the load transfer method. At the mean time, the effect of angle of tapering is introduced to evaluate the end bearing capacity of <b>tapered</b> <b>piles.</b> The test results and proposed models show that a slight increase in the tapering angle of the pile results in higher skin friction and affects the end bearing resistance compared with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities. The proposed models are then applied to different types of prototype and real type pile tests in order to evaluate the predicted skin friction, expected end bearing capacity and vertical bearing capacity...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel piling system is investigated, which involves a spun-cast ductile iron (SCDI) tapered shaft fitted with a lower helical plate. It combines {{the efficiency of the}} tapered section, the competitive cost, effectiveness and durability of spun cast ductile iron with a rough surface and the construction advantages of helical piles. The system is installed using a fast, low vibration and reduced noise process. Seven instrumented piles including five SCDI tapered and two steel straight pipes were installed in sand using mechanical torque. The piles were subjected to cyclic and monotonic compression, uplift and lateral load tests. Different loading sequences were adopted to assess the effect of prior cyclic/monotonic loading on the piles’ performance. The installation torque was monitored and the resulting capacity-to-torque ratio was compared to the literature reported values. The compaction of the previously disturbed sand from the helix penetration due to the <b>pile</b> <b>taper</b> resulted in superior compressive behavior of the proposed system compared to the straight shaft <b>piles.</b> The <b>tapered</b> <b>piles</b> exhibited higher stiffness at lower displacements compared to the straight shafted piles and the helix increased their uplift resistance. In addition, tapered shafts enhanced the lateral stiffness and the helix provided fixation due to the passive bearing pressures on the helix surfaces, which further improved the lateral {{performance of}} the short helical piles. A three dimensional finite element model was established and calibrated using the experimental data. The model was then used to simulate the response of SCDI piles with different configurations when subjected to different loading conditions including axial and lateral as well as combined moment-horizontal loads. Under cyclic loading, the <b>tapered</b> helical <b>piles</b> exhibited better compressive performance while the straight shaft helical piles performed better in uplift loading. The proposed system stiffness remained practically unchanged through the cyclic lateral loading applied in the current study. The monotonic performance of the <b>tapered</b> helical <b>piles</b> in clay was numerically simulated. The results showed an increase in axial and lateral capacity and stiffness of the <b>tapered</b> <b>piles</b> over the straight shaft ones, with greater uplift-to-compressive capacity ratio than in sand...|$|R

The angle of tapering is inserted in the proposed model to evaluate the end-bearing capacity. The test results of the proposed model in different types of sands and different relative densities show good effects compared to conventional straight piles. The end-bearing capacity increases with increases in the tapering angle.

40|$|In recent time piled {{foundations}} are extensively applied {{due to an}} increase of storeys in buildings constructed in Minsk and load increment on the soil. Preference is given to this approach even in the case when relatively firm soil occurs in the top part of the foundation bed. In this case maximum usage of the foundation bed bearing capacity and reduction of foundation cost are considered as top-priority tasks for designers. One {{of the ways to}} increase the bearing capacity of {{piled foundations}} is the necessity to take into account resistance of foundation bed soil located under raft bottom. The raft as well as a shallow foundation is capable to transfer a significant part of building load into the soil. Such approach makes it possible to reduce a number of piles in the foundation or shorten their length. Then it results in shortening of the construction period and significant reduction in zero cycle. However up to the present moment reliable calculation methods that permit to take into account soil resistance in the raft base. An analysis of previous investigations on the matter executed by various researchers and a number of field investigations have been carried out with the purpose to develop the proposed methods. The paper presents results of field investigations on foundations consisting of short stamped <b>tapered</b> <b>piles</b> which are joined together {{with the help of the}} raft fragment. Strength and deformation characteristics of the bases are increasing while making such foundations in the fill-up soil. In this case the filled-up ground layer becomes a bearing layer both for piles and rafts as well. Improvement of high-plastic clay-bearing soil properties is ensured by ramming dry concrete mix under pile foot. The paper describes an experience on application of the piled-raft foundation in complicated engineering and geological conditions while constructing the Orthodox Church in Minsk. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} development of an improved method for the static and dynamic analysis of driven piles for both forward and inverse solutions. Wave propagation in piles, which is the result of pile head (or toe) impact and the distributed mass and elasticity of the pile, was analyzed in two ways: forward (the hammer is modeled and the pile response and capacity for a certain blow count is estimated) or inverse (the force-time and velocity-or displacement-time history from driving data is used to estimate the pile capacity.) The finite element routine developed was a three dimensional model of the hammer, pile and soil system using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, Newmark 2 ̆ 7 s method for the dynamic solution and a modified Newton method for the static solution. Soil properties were aggregated to simplify data entry and analysis. The three-dimensional model allowed for more accurate modeling of the various parts of the system and phenomena that are not well addressed with current one-dimensional methods, including bending effects in the cap and shaft response of <b>tapered</b> <b>piles.</b> Soil layering was flexible and could either follow the grid generation or be manually input. The forward method could either model the hammer explicitly or use a given force-time history, analyzing the pile response. The inverse method used an optimization technique to determine the aggregated soil properties of a given layering scheme. In both cases the static axial capacity of the pile was estimated using the same finite element model as the dynamic method and incrementally loaded. The results were then analyzed using accepted load test interpretation criteria. The model was run in test cases against current methods to verify its features, one of which was based on actual field data using current techniques for both data acquisition and analysis, with reasonable correlation of the results. The routine was standalone and did not require additional code to use...|$|R

The novel analytical-numerical technique {{is based on an}} energy or variational scheme in which the deformation of the bar is specified by a function, which is indeterminate to within a set of unknown constants. A minimization of the potential energy of the bar-elastic medium system is used to determine these arbitrary constants.
