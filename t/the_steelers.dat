5|$|Throughout Bell's {{affiliation}} with <b>the</b> <b>Steelers,</b> he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment {{of the franchise}} from him. Compounding Bell's problems, Arch Ward organized the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL's sovereignty in professional football. Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league, which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically. In Bill Dudley's contract proceedings with <b>the</b> <b>Steelers,</b> he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC. Furthermore, {{by the end of}} 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Steelers</b> were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Steelers</b> {{played the}} Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the two merged {{as a result of}} player {{shortages}} caused by World War II. Steelers president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and <b>the</b> <b>Steelers</b> didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors.

5|$|In December 1940, Bell conciliated {{the sale}} of Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, and then Rooney {{acquired}} half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.
