5000|$|The use of gastric filling {{devices to}} induce weight loss is not new. DeBakey’s review in 1938 showed that bezoars led to weight loss. Free {{floating}} intragastric balloons {{were used by}} Neiben and Harboe in 1982. Percival presented a “balloon diet” in 1984 when he placed inflated mammary implants as gastric balloons. [...] In 1985 the Garren-Edwards Bubble was introduced as the first FDA-approved device, but <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> was <b>withdrawn</b> seven years later because of complications.

Before his retirement, in 1999, doctor DeVries decided, in 1988, to go back to traditional cardiovascular surgery.

40|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Prospectus Directive, the publication of a prospectus for an offer of securities to the public, or an admission of securities to trading on a regulated market, is subject to <b>the</b> prior <b>approval</b> of <b>the</b> prospectus by the competent authority of the issuer's home Member State. This article examines <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system as envisaged under the Directive. The aim is two-fold. First, the article conceptualises <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system as a regulatory instrument. By studying {{the provisions}} relating to <b>the</b> prior <b>approval</b> in <b>the</b> Prospectus Directive, and by drawing on the literature on regulation, <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system will be conceptualised as an ex ante enforcement system. Second, the article examines <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system critically as an investor protection measure and as a risk reduction strategy for issuers. Proceeding on the premise that in order to justify <b>the</b> prior <b>approval,</b> <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system must not only improve upon the quality of disclosure but that this improvement must matter if considered {{from the perspective of the}} recipient of the approved prospectus, the benefits and costs of <b>the</b> prior <b>approval</b> will be assessed for investors and issuers. These two points will be developed hereunder by examining in turn the regulatory nature and the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> system...|$|R
