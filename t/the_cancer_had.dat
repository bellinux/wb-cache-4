5|$|In May 2008, Cormier was {{diagnosed}} with lymphoma. He underwent treatment but {{suffered a heart attack}} soon after beginning. Doctors later determined that <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> moved into his bone marrow. He died on March 4, 2009 at a hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Marley's last concert {{occurred}} at the Stanley Theater (now called The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980. Just two days earlier he had collapsed during a jogging tour in Central Park and was brought to hospital where he learned that <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> spread to his brain.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1951, Lacks, who was 31 years old, went to Johns Hopkins for {{a routine}} {{treatment}} session {{and asked to}} be admitted due to continued severe abdominal pain. She received blood transfusions and remained at the hospital until her death on October 4, 1951. A partial autopsy showed that <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> metastasized throughout her entire body.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} is most commonly either partial or complete {{removal of the}} affected kidney(s). Where <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the 5-year survival rate is 65–90%, but this is lowered considerably when <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread.|$|R

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Marley's health {{deteriorated}} as <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> {{spread throughout}} his body. The {{rest of the}} tour was cancelled and Marley sought treatment at the Bavarian clinic of Josef Issels, where he received an alternative cancer treatment called Issels treatment partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other substances. After fighting the cancer without success for eight months Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Weakened {{from breast}} cancer and her {{treatment}} regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments and in March they discovered that <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> reached her liver. She {{died of a heart}} attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaining}} of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary {{went to the}} Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed a malignant brain tumor. They removed it that week, and McNary {{was released from the}} hospital on December 2, but <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> already spread to other parts of his body. He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter. He partly recovered from the surgery, but by February 24, 1944, when he was re-elected as Republican Senate leader, he was comatose. Charles L. McNary died in Fort Lauderdale, and he was buried in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem. He was given a state funeral during which his body lay in state in the chamber of the Oregon House of Representatives at the Oregon State Capitol, Salem.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and <b>the</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} from Somalia to Switzerland in late September 1992, Hepburn began suffering from abdominal pain.

In 1995, in apparent good health, Springfield set about promoting the album, which was released that year.
