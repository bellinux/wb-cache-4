50|$|The Michelson {{spectrograph}} {{is similar}} to the instrument used in the Michelson-Morley experiment. Light from the source is split into two beams by a half-silvered mirror, one is reflected off a fixed mirror and one off a movable mirror, which introduces a time delay—the Fourier-transform spectrometer is just a Michelson interferometer with a movable mirror. The beams interfere, allowing the temporal coherence of the light to be measured at each different <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>setting,</b> effectively converting the time domain into a spatial coordinate. By making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the movable mirror, the spectrum can be reconstructed using a Fourier transform of the temporal coherence of the light. Michelson spectrographs are capable of very high spectral resolution observations of very bright sources.The Michelson or Fourier-transform spectrograph was popular for infra-red applications at a time when infra-red astronomy only had single-pixel detectors. Imaging Michelson spectrometers are a possibility, but in general have been supplanted by imaging Fabry-Pérot instruments, which are easier to construct.|$|E

40|$|In {{automatic}} {{lighting control}} systems, {{there can be}} considerable uncertainty associated with the determination of occupancy using single-point sensing, resulting in lights switching off when the space is still occupied. Current control systems compensate for this uncertainty with a <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>setting</b> of 20 to 30 minutes to ensure user satisfaction, which can double the operating time of the lighting system controlled. This dissertation describes three studies investigating {{the performance of a}} network of linked occupancy sensors, and establishes that a network of sensors offers more accurate occupancy measurement, and greater energy savings than can be achieved with a single sensor. ^ The accuracy of occupancy detection can be greatly enhanced by fusing the data stream from a sensor network with an analysis algorithm. Eight data fusion methods, from the simple logical functions to more sophisticated Bayesian belief network and neural network methods, were applied in this research. The most advanced of these methods, that incorporate knowledge of detector performance and typical occupancy patterns, can self-diagnose and identify faulty sensor(s), and improve the accuracy, reliability and robustness of the whole control system. The accuracy of occupancy detection (in terms of 2 ̆ 6 phiv; correlation, where 2 ̆ 6 phiv;= 1 means perfect match) can be improved from 0. 68 by a single sensor to 0. 88 using a sensor network with a neural network algorithm. ^ Because of the increase in accuracy of occupancy detection, much shorter time delays (e. g. 5 minutes) {{can be applied to the}} sensor network without sacrificing user satisfaction, and the operating time of occupancy-based building systems can be reduced by an extra 20...|$|E

40|$|The <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> {{estimation}} between <b>time</b> {{series is}} a real-world problem in gravitational lensing, {{an area of}} astrophysics. Lensing is the most direct method of measuring the distribution of matter, which is often dark, and the accurate measurement of <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> <b>set</b> the scale to measure distances over cosmological scales. For our purposes, this means {{that we have to}} estimate a <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between two or more noisy and irregularly sampled time series.

Objectives : to describe relevant aspects of thrombolytic therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in Cienfuegos. Methods : a descriptive, prospective study was conducted with 225 patients discharged (alive and dead) from the Comprehensive Cardiac Care Unit and the Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit of the Dr. Gustavo Aldereguía Lima Hospital during April 1, 2012 -March 31, 2013. The variables were obtained from the review of medical records and they included: demographic and clinical variables, <b>time</b> <b>delays,</b> <b>setting,</b> reasons for exclusion and priority level for thrombolysis. Results: mean age was over 60 years. Hypertensive men at high risk according to the GRACE score predominated. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy, mostly due to the time factor and the majority (82. 3 %) was treated in the hospital. Median delays: symptoms-door, door-drug and symptoms-drug were 90, 35 and 140 minutes respectively. Conclusions: out-of-hospital thrombolytic therapy shortens the total time of ischemia, but few patients benefited from it.

40|$|Phased {{arrays of}} {{parabolic}} antennas are a potentially lower-cost {{way to provide}} uplink transmission to distant spacecraft, compared to the 34 -m and 70 -m antennas now used by the NASA Deep Space Network. A large transmit array could provide very high EIRP when needed for spacecraft emergencies, such as the equivalent of 1 MW radiated from a 70 -m antenna. Cost-effectiveness is realized by dividing the array into smaller arrays to provide routine support to many spacecraft simultaneously. The antennas might be as small as 12 -m in diameter, {{with as many as}} 100 antennas covering an area of 0. 5 km to 1 km in extent. Such arrays present significant technical challenges in phase alignment, which must be maintained at close to 1 mm. The concept requires a very stable system with accurately known antenna phase center locations. The system is first calibrated by transmitting from all antennas, and observing the signals at a target located in the far fields of the individual antennas. The antennas are then pointed to the operational targets, with the signal phases and <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> <b>set</b> to reinforce in the target directions. This requires accurate knowledge of the target directions and calculation of the required phases. The system must be phase-stable for all directions and over the time between calibrations, which is desired to be at least one day. In this paper, a system concept is presented, the major error sources are identified, a rough error budget is established, and key elements of the system are discussed. A calibration method is recommended which uses satellites as radar targets.
