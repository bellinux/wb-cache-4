5|$|Once Pluto was found, its faintness {{and lack}} of a resolvable disc cast doubt on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised {{downward}} throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the Peak District name include <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{came from}} the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it fell within the large Anglian kingdom of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used for}} emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|SuperKaramba was {{integrated}} into KDE 3.5 {{as part of}} the kdeutils package, and some of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> presents have become part of KDE 4’s desktop and panel interface called Plasma, which also has support for the SuperKaramba widgets.|$|R
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the album as a whole, Amos surmised, [...] "I would say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> embraces the rebirth of light, but light means knowledge, light means consciousness.

40|$|In {{considering}} {{all of the}} issues and queries that have arisen throughout the SCEiP project, perhaps one of the ones that still surprises me is the “but I can’t do both” statement. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> not possible to achieve both academic and practice impact, and that researchers have to focus on activities to generate one or the other, but can’t manage both...|$|R
5|$|The DOB {{spread to}} Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and The Ladder {{was mailed to}} hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members {{discussing}} the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians, and suggesting ways {{to cope with the}} condition or society's response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a crime to end one's allegiance to the parent state.|$|E
5|$|The condor {{on top of}} {{the shield}} {{stretches}} his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.|$|E

One of his first {{decisions}} as coach was to hire Cannon, although his role was not immediately defined.

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species of}} pigeon which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was related to the}} Nicobar pigeon (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

50|$|Osterman, in his director's statement, {{explained}} <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> was {{my intention}} {{to create a}} narrative that put the viewer in {{the seat of the}} experiment itself - one where the audience was never quite sure of who to trust and unsure if it was all just an elaborate ruse. The puzzle aspect of the movie will be challenging to some, but I wanted to echo Rod Serling and trust in <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> okay for <b>the</b> audience to not have all the answers - to be comfortable with the unknown.|$|R
5000|$|A mental {{institution}} called St. Walker's Hospital is {{mentioned in the}} Arrow second-season episode entitled [...] "Blast Radius." [...] St. Walker's is a {{mental institution}} in which Brother Blood's mother resides. Laurel Lance becomes suspicious of Blood and tracks the woman down to the institute with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> Blood's aunt, but finds out that she is in fact Blood's mother. Blood himself later comes and kills his mother in the following episode [...] "Blind Spot" [...] and this forces Laurel to go to Arrow for help.|$|R

25|$|From the Dutch scholar Cornelius de Pauw, Hoffman took <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{forbidden}} {{for women to}} iherit the throne of Egypt, an important plot point in the opera. He also researched details of Egyptian funerary rites in Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus.|$|E
25|$|Uemura {{added an}} eject lever to the {{cartridge}} slot {{which was not}} really necessary, but he felt that children could be entertained by pressing it.

25|$|Nonetheless, {{around the}} same time that Evans was {{publishing}} his theory of a pagan survival, there were also researchers who had examined the origins of the Society and criticised <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had ancient roots. In 1962, Hamish Henderson detailed how it had arisen in the eighteenth century, with his information being expanded upon by Ian Carter in his 1979 study of agricultural life in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, Kim Newman (Monthly Film Bulletin) {{stated that}} the films combination of [...] "splattery violence", [...] "James Bond spy thriller", and [...] "monster-filled s-f" [...] was [...] "at times uneasy, but Cozzi carries it off with sufficient bravura to paper over the cracks" [...] and that [...] "If the film relies on familiar images...it at least has a class, very loud score by Dario Argento's usual collaborators, The Goblins, to punch up the frissons." [...] Mike Long (DVD Talk) stated that Contamination [...] "makes good use of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> stolen, at heart it is simply another boring Euro-horror film." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} propositions {{as far as}} the origin of name of [...] "Zmerynka" [...] is concerned. One of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be derived from the Polish words, {{describing}} the handshake.|$|R

25|$|In July 2012, Dangote {{approached}} the Nigerian Ports Authorities to lease an abandoned {{piece of land}} at the Apapa Port, which was approved. He later built facilities for his flour company there. In the 1990s, he {{approached the}} Central Bank of Nigeria with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be cheaper for the bank to allow his transport company to manage their fleet of staff buses, a proposal that was also approved.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{told the}} War Committee (22 February 1916) that the French desire to {{transfer}} {{more troops to}} Salonika showed a weakening in their resolve for trench warfare. He scorned <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, and at a late March 1916 conference argued with Briand (French Prime Minister) and Joffre, who thumped the table and shouted that Robertson was “un homme terrible”.|$|E
25|$|This pattern had {{probably}} developed {{before the beginning}} of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant {{in the course of the}} Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence. No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure.|$|E

25|$|The SDA {{attempts}} {{to have a}} relatively positive relationship with retail employers, with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> allows it to negotiate better outcomes for its members than a more confrontational approach because of the reluctance of SDA members to take industrial action, which rarely if ever occurs in the SDA. This reluctance is inherent to the categories of workers who are covered by the SDA - young people {{and women who are}} generally in casual employment.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{alluvial}} fans of impermeable clay {{the rock}} is highly porous {{due to a}} network of small faults, which dips into the warmer regions below the surface. Warm springs and vapors are common, giving the appearance of volcanic activity. The ancients cross-culturally viewed these phenomena as being caused by divinities, which rock-paintings indicate they worshipped. The north slopes of Latmus are subject to heavy and damaging mudslides, which also would have contributed to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a god.|$|E
25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected {{this understanding of}} Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a simple}} science, philosophy. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> never matters {{what happens to you}} {{provided}} you don't mind it. The weak point in the argument is that nine times out of ten you can't help minding it.|$|R
50|$|Rafighdoost {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} that he twice suggested to Khomeini that Iran develop {{weapons of mass destruction}} to counter their use by Saddam Hussein.

5000|$|According to the Chicago Tribune, NWS Chicago had [...] "the worst {{record in}} the nation" [...] for issuing {{warnings}} for severe storms, only issuing warnings 24% {{of the time when}} a warning was justifiable. Even today, many meteorologists refer to the [...] "Plainfield Syndrome" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> better to issue too many warnings and be wrong than to miss one critical warning, as was the case for the Plainfield Tornado. At some point after the 1990 tornado, the National Weather Service reduced the Chicago office's workload by creating an office in Romeoville, Illinois and allowing offices in the Quad Cities, St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Paducah, Kentucky to issue forecasts for their respective areas.|$|R
