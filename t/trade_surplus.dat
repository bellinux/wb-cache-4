5|$|In other words, {{a country}} that imports more than it exports must either {{decrease}} its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports.

5|$|A {{country with}} a large <b>trade</b> <b>surplus</b> would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency.

25|$|Further, Eurozone {{countries}} with sustained trade surpluses (i.e., Germany) {{do not see}} their currency appreciate relative to the other Eurozone nations due to a common currency, keeping their exports artificially cheap. Germany's <b>trade</b> <b>surplus</b> within the Eurozone declined in 2011 as its trading partners were less able to find financing necessary to fund their trade deficits, but Germany's <b>trade</b> <b>surplus</b> outside the Eurozone has soared as the euro declined in value relative to the dollar and other currencies.|$|E

25|$|China's <b>trade</b> <b>surplus</b> is {{considered}} by some in the United States as threatening American jobs. In the 2000s, the Bush administration pursued protectionist policies such as tariffs and quotas to limit the import of Chinese goods. Some scholars argue that China's growing <b>trade</b> <b>surplus</b> {{is the result of}} industries in more developed Asian countries moving to China, and not a new phenomenon. China's trade policy, which allows producers to avoid paying the Value Added Tax (VAT) for exports and undervaluation of the currency since 2002, has resulted in an overdeveloped export sector and distortion of the economy overall, a result that could hamper future growth.|$|E

40|$|Two ex ante identically {{informed}} agents play a two-period alternating offer bargaining {{game over}} {{the division of}} a known surplus with endogenous information and common values. This paper shows that a low discounting of <b>trading</b> <b>surplus,</b> a positive externality of information acquisition and an endogenous lemons problem can cause delay of agreement. In the period of disagreement the buyer and the seller have symmetric information. For the case where the discount factor d of <b>trading</b> <b>surplus</b> is zero, a perfect equilibrium exists in which the responder captures full surplus in take-it-or-leave-it offer bargaining. The equilibrium payoff of the first period proposer can increase with d, the bargaining power of the counter party...|$|R

40|$|A pegged {{exchange}} rate regime has been pivotal to China's export-led development strategy. However, its huge <b>trade</b> <b>surpluses</b> and massive build up of international reserves have been matched by large deficits for major trading partners, creating acute policy concerns abroad, especially in the USA. This paper provides a straightforward conceptual framework for interpreting the effect of China's {{exchange rate}} policy on its own trade balance and that of trading partners {{in the context of}} discrepant economic growth rates. It shows how pegging the exchange rate when output is outstripping expenditure induces China's <b>trade</b> <b>surpluses</b> and counterpart deficits for its trading partners. An important corollary is that given its strictly regulated capital account, China's persistently large surpluses imply a significantly undervalued renminbi, which should gradually become more flexible.
