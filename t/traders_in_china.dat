Since the establishment of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2000, China-Africa trade volume has rapidly increased, reaching more than US$ 200 billion in 2012. Market openness, shifts in trade patterns leading to trade liberalisation in China and Africa and China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in December 2001, have contributed to boosting Sino-African trade volumes.

The governing role of market actors, such as traders and consumers in importing countries, {{has been recognized}} and embraced for sustainable seafood sourcing and trade. The perceptions that affect the conduct of these actors are a potential influence on governance of distal environments. In this paper we investigate the perceptions of sea cucumber <b>traders</b> <b>in</b> <b>China.</b> Sea cucumbers are an important global fishery commodity predominantly traded to China, the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest seafood market, and seven traded species are endangered globally. We examine what traders and consumers in China perceive as important issues in seafood markets, and where they perceive the responsibility for sustainable fisheries to lie, to interpret what scope there is for sustainability to become an important issue in China 2 ̆ 7 s seafood markets. We find that clusters of perceptions about cultural status, quality, health and food safety, and country of origin influence decisions that consumers make. These norms are rooted in sociocultural practice and drive current trade strategies. While traders do want to mitigate risks and secure supplies, food safety, product quality and country of origin are viewed as more important concerns than stock sustainability. Responsibility for sustainable fishing {{is perceived to be}} that of national governments in production countries. Trading practices and consumer perceptions together pose a serious challenge to sustainable seafood markets, further confounded by clandestine cross-border gray trade into China...|$|E

40|$|We {{test for}} noise trader risk in China stock market through the {{interaction}} between noise traders and information traders by applying the Information-Adjusted Noise Model. Information traders tend to underreact, overreact or increase information pricing error (IPE effects) on the stock market. Consequently information <b>traders</b> <b>in</b> <b>China</b> drive price away from fundamental level rather than correcting for the price error. We test our model {{using data from the}} Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We finally present evidence that the market is informational inefficient. The most common violation of information efficiency is overreaction and information pricing error. Liquidity, profitability, size, leverage, capital expenditure, price to book ratio, financial crisis, seasonality and market sentiment are used to explain noise trader risk. The existing literature confirms the existence of noise trader risk in developed markets like the US and Australia but little has been done in emerging markets. The literature suspects the existence of noise trader risk in China but there is no &lsquo;direct and appropriate methodology&rsquo; that has been used to quantity this risk.

40|$|The article {{reports on}} a study to examine the {{application}} of guanxi attributes and the pathways linking them to success and performance {{in the context of}} business-to-business relationships in the Chinese diamond industry. We draw on and adapt the Ganqing, Renqing and Xinren (GRX) scale to reveal a paradox in terms of how business is conventionally conducted. This is interesting because in Western markets that are typically governed by arms-length transactions the diamond industry is somewhat unique, as it is built on very close socially driven relationships. The paradox also occurs in the Chinese context, as the opposite is prevalent i. e., in a nation that often relies on social guanxi ties to drive business, the diamond industry is heavily characterized by a somewhat antagonistic arms-length approach. The study pieces together and tests a concept drawing on a sample of 212 diamond merchant <b>traders</b> operating <b>in</b> <b>China.</b> We discover that interpersonal trust (Xinren) has a positive influence on both emotional attachment (Ganqing) and obligational favor (Renqing), but has a direct negative influence on Performance (the paradox). Ganqing serves to positively influence Performance and Renqing leads to greater Satisfaction - which in turn has a positive bearing on Performance.
