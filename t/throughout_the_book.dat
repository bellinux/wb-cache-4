5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall.

In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E
