In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States, a careful review of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem</b> of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by World War II, Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of Mission 66, and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.|$|E

[...] The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry; the Kepler problem is mathematically {{equivalent to a}} particle moving freely {{on the surface of}} a four-dimensional (hyper-)sphere, so that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem</b> is symmetric under certain rotations of the four-dimensional space. [...] This higher symmetry results from two properties of the Kepler problem: the velocity vector always moves in a perfect circle and, for a given total energy, all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points.|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem</b> of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem</b> of {{knowledge}} has constantly been that {{of bringing the}} one and the many together.

The question that comes up at once is whether there is any unity in this variety, whether there is one principle in accordance with which all these many things appear and occur.

A complete understanding will require arrays of mathematical models, a wealth of data from measurements of various life processes, and readily accessible databases that can be interrogated for testing our understanding. Accomplishing this will require improved approaches for mathematical modeling, unprecedented standardization for experimentation and data collection, completeness of data sets, and improved methods of accessing and linking information. Solving <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cell <b>problem,</b> even for a simple E. coli model cell, will require the concerted efforts of many scientists with different expertise.

2500|$|Retrospectively, Pop {{is viewed}} in the music press and public as a disappointment. In a 2013 article, Spin was more {{critical}} of the album than in the magazine's original review, calling it [...] "U2's nadir period" [...] and a [...] "weirder, bolder, nervier record than its garish exterior would suggest... if you can tune out Bono's mugging, which of course you can't, which was <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem.</b> The stupidity of all this subsumed the prescient bravery of it..."

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>problem</b> is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify how a certain newly obtained piece of knowledge and concept can be comprehended by the students in Japan before they study them at school and after a certain long time has since the first study of them. We can regard our problem as that of how the association pattern of knowledge in one’s understanding can be changed by his/her learning activities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we carry out}} an {{investigation}} {{into some of the}} major features of exam timetabling problems with a view to developing a similarity measure. This similarity measure will be used within a casebased reasoning (CBR) system to match a new problem with one from a case-base of previously solved problems. The case base will also store the heuristic or meta-heuristic technique(s) applied most successfully to each problem stored. The technique(s) stored with the matched case will be retrieved and applied to the new case. The motivation behind our similarity measure is that similar problems should be solved equally well by the same technique. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss which features and combinations of features of exam timetabling problems are potentially important for measuring such similarity.
