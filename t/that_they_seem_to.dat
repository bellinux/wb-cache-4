5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to Ô¨Ånd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E

5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
25|$|The family {{descended from}} {{north-eastern}} Asia Minor, either from Lesser Armenia or {{the theme of}} Sebasteia. Due to their origin, they have been traditionally regarded as Armenians, although this is nowhere explicitly attested. They have been linked more specifically with the area around Melitene, where {{a member of the}} family was active in the 840s, and where the rebellions of Bardas Skleros in the 970s and 980s were centred. After <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have moved their base to the Anatolic Theme, where they are recorded to have had large estates in the 11th century.|$|E

This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and {{on the same side of}} the lens as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.|$|E
500|$|Having {{introduced}} {{the reader to}} the forms of power, Russell applies those forms to a selection of organisations. The purpose of discussing organisations is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} most common sources of social power. By an [...] "organization", Russell means a set of people who share some activities, and directed at common goals, which is typified by a redistribution of power (Russell 1938:128). Organizations differ in size and type, though common to them all is the tendency for inequality of power to increase as membership increases.|$|E

When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans {{to turn into a}} park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{distinguished}} [...] "Ammi" [...] is an amora {{of the third}} generation (3rd century). His native country is not named, but it is generally assumed to be Babylonia. It seems probable that the lifelong friendship existing between R. Ammi and R. Assi had its origin in ties of blood. R. Assi is identical with R. Assi (Jose) b. Nathan, and R. Ammi's full name, as given by himself, is Ammi ben Nathan (Gi·π≠. 44a); both of them, moreover, were of priestly descent (Meg. 22a, ·∏§ul. 107b), so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been {{the sons of the}} same father; and as R. Assi is a native Babylonian, there is reason for assuming R. Ammi's Babylonian nativity.|$|E
2500|$|Martinus Scriblerus was a {{corporate}} identity employed by Pope {{and the other}} members of the Scriblerians. Therefore, these two portions of the preface could have been written by any of its members, but they, like the other prefatory materials, were most likely written by Pope himself. The various Dunces had written responses to Pope after the first publication of The Dunciad, and they had not only written against Pope, but had explained why Pope had attacked other writers. In the [...] "Testimonies" [...] section, Martinus Scriblerus culls all the comments the Dunces made about each other in their replies and sets them side by side, so that each is condemned by another. He also culls their contradictory characterisations of Pope, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> all damn and praise the same qualities over and over again.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "loving {{offenders}}" [...] in line 5 can have two meanings: that the offenders (the fair youth and the mistress) are in love; but it can also mean <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> enjoy their offense. This line, along with line 12, [...] "And both for my sake lay on me this cross," [...] hearken back to Sonnet 34, in which the speaker declares, [...] "The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief / To him that bears the strong offence's cross." [...] The biblical allusion of the cross ties the poet himself to Jesus in his suffering so that others might be happy, relieved of their sins. Hammond writes that he feels the author was projecting himself as a martyr, a Christ like figure bearing the cross. Hammond reads line 5, [...] "loving offenders" [...] to mean equally as a vocative or self description; saying, 'it is my nature to love those who offend against me'. [...] It appears that most critics agree that the author himself is accepting the 'cross' in this poem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} characters, Weebl and Bob, are best friends, but are easily prone to harassing and {{insulting}} each other though these insults are mainly directed at Bob. Both characters are egg-shaped creatures with wide mouths that split {{their heads in}} half (like South Park's representation of Canadians), and move by rolling, hopping or swaying back and forth. They just mutter and 'talk' in a way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> understand {{between the two of}} them. Weebl is the larger of the two, during the series it is revealed that Bob's small stature is due to a cheese overdose in the 1980s. [...] Many of their stories are centred around their love of pie, a devotion shared by most of the other characters in their world‚Äîthese episodes generally depict one of their several (often failed) attempts to obtain it. We also know that the two characters don't have a house as Weebl sold it to buy a rocket ship. Some episodes are a vehicle to introduce a new character into the storyline, while others are parodies of cultural phenomena, such as Hello Kitty, Japanese karate and ninja movies, '80s anti-drug documentaries, Michael Moore's documentary film Fahrenheit 9/11, Kill Bill, the crime drama , the iPod [...] "silhouette" [...] ad campaign, the MTV show Pimp My Ride, the game show The Krypton Factor, Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, the video game Portal, Final Fantasy VII, the Academy Awards and even retailers such as PC World ('Pissy Werld' in the show), IKEA (or 'PIKEA') and Matalan ('Catalan').|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part of the problem is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would get that kind of reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
