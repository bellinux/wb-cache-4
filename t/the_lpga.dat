5|$|At {{this point}} in her career, Sörenstam says she lost focus having reached her biggest goals. Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam still managed to win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s. She {{qualified}} for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch's/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> tour in October 2003. Sörenstam was the first international player to {{be inducted into the}} Hall of Fame through <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> criteria.|$|E

5|$|Other {{branches}} of the ANNIKA business include a clothing line with Cutter & Buck, a limited label wine produced in partnership with Wente Vineyards, and a signature fragrance developed by SA Fragrances. Sörenstam also hosted the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika, an event on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Tour in 2007 and 2008, and the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika on the Ladies European Tour during its last four years from 2005 through 2008. She won the latter tournament in 2005 and 2006. Both tournaments had their last event in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Sörenstam's life {{both on and}} off {{the golf}} course changed in 2005. In February, she {{announced}} that she had filed for divorce from David Esch, her husband of eight years, and this was finalised in August but it did not adversely affect her golf. Her achievements included being the first player in LPGA history to win a major three consecutive years at <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Championship and the first golfer in LPGA or PGA history to win the same event five consecutive years at the Mizuno Classic. 11 wins in 21 tournaments entered worldwide included victory in the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika where she presented herself the trophy, giving her an eighth Money List title, tying <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> record, an eighth Rolex Player of the Year (POY) award (a record) and a sixth Vare Trophy. She is the only LPGA player ever to win Money List, POY award and Vare trophy in the same year in five different years. Team competition saw her make her seventh consecutive Solheim Cup appearance, her 4 points making her total 21, the event's all-time leading points earner, and the inaugural Lexus Cup was played with Sörenstam as the Captain of the victorious International Team.|$|E

5|$|Sörenstam started 2007 {{by losing}} a playoff while {{defending}} of her MasterCard Classic title. At the Kraft Nabisco Championship she shot her highest 72-hole score {{in a major}} in nine years, a result explained by her subsequent diagnosis with ruptured and bulging discs in her neck, the first major injury in Sörenstam's 13-year LPGA career. After a two-month injury rehabilitation break, Sörenstam returned as the Ginn Tribute tournament hostess where she admitted to being at only 85% fitness and finished tied for 36th place. She was still not fully fit in her next two tournaments, <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Championship where she finished tied for 15th place, and the US Women's Open, where, as defending champion, she finished tied for 32nd.|$|E
5|$|Sörenstam turned {{professional}} in 1992, but missed her LPGA Tour card {{at the final}} qualifying tournament by one shot, and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour (LET), {{formerly known as the}} WPGET. She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993, where she finished T38th, 4th, and T9th, earning more than $47,000. She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year. By tying for 28th at <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non-exempt status for the 1994 season. Sörenstam's first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women's Australian Open on the ALPG Tour.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first-ever}} {{official}} Women's World Golf Rankings were unveiled in February 2006, Sörenstam was confirmed as the number-one player in women's golf, a position she relinquished to Lorena Ochoa on 22 April 2007. In partnership with Liselotte Neumann in team Sweden, {{she won the}} Women's World Cup of Golf, opened her LPGA season with a defence of her title in the MasterCard Classic. She then went winless in eight starts, causing some to talk of a slump. Her winning drought ended at the U.S. Women's Open, where she won an 18-hole playoff over Pat Hurst for her tenth major championship title, tying her for third {{on the list of}} players with most major championship titles. She totalled 3 wins on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> and two on the Ladies European Tour, the inaugural Dubai Ladies Masters and the Swedish tournament she hosts, which she defended in her home town at the course where she learned to play. Her International team lost the second Lexus Cup competition to Team Asia.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 {{she went}} to the United States and won the U.S. Women's Open in an 18-hole playoff against Ayako Okamoto and JoAnne Carner. It was a victory that led <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> to amend its {{constitution}}. Davies was not a member of <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Tour, so <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> changed its constitution to grant Davies automatic membership. Since 1988 Laura Davies has played on both <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> and Ladies European Tours. In 1988 Davies won twice as a rookie on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Tour, three times on the Ladies European Tour and once in Japan, becoming the first woman ever to win on all three major Tours in the same year.|$|E

With a partial LPGA schedule, she spent {{time on the}} Futures Tour developmental circuit in 2007. After finishing 109th on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Tour money list, Park returned to the Final Qualifying Tournament in December, where she won with a 17-under-par total and gained full playing privileges on <b>the</b> <b>LPGA</b> Tour for 2008.|$|E
