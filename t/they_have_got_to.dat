500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

60|$|Miss Drewitt, {{listening}} helplessly to this fulsome {{exchange of}} compliments, wondered whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end. The captain looked at Mr. Tredgold {{as though to}} remind {{him that it was}} his turn.|$|R
6000|$|... 45. To-day I will {{endeavor}} {{to explain how}} they attained such rank. Then, {{in the next two}} lectures, the technics of both,--their way of speaking; and in the last two, what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|R
2500|$|... "To hear a {{supporter}} say MyFootballClub are preventing investment from someone shows the desperation {{people are in}} and exposes the way that club is being run, which {{is not in a}} sustainable way. [...] <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get a grip of that business rather than run after a guy who is promising four-year contracts and saying it's okay. [...] It {{is one of the worst}} proposals I have ever seen put to anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{closed with}} [...] "Meanwhile, {{whenever}} {{there is a}} failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights.

2500|$|Lee also criticised the government's {{policies}} {{by stating}} that [...] "hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens {{to go up to}} the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced.

[...] He also lamented [...] "Malaysia—to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} {{the foot of the}} slope, they found the mules and donkeys there. Rollo and Josie insisted that Mr. George and the student should ride, because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> ascend the cone again.|$|R
6000|$|Harold's first exclamation {{was one of}} thankfulness {{for their}} deliverance, to which Disco replied with a hearty [...] "Amen!"

60|$|Once in {{the cold}} keen air Fan began to recover {{strength}} and confidence, {{but she was still}} too weak to walk fast, and when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the long road where the benches were, she was compelled to sit down and rest for some time.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the old {{question}} over again," [...] answered James Morris. [...] "The Indians won't become farmers, and so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> suffer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly {{a pretty}} good sign, for the {{squirrels}} know just about how long <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> keep themselves in food before spring comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why shouldn't I know it, Larry? I've heard tell on {{it often}} enough. But <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> prove we air spies first, ain't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|She set {{off at a}} good pace up the High Street, {{attended}} by her faithful follower, and passing through the small suburbs, struck out into the country beyond. After four miles the boatswain, who was no walker, reminded her that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go back.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the tea-table by this time; {{and while}} at tea, Rollo’s father {{explained}} {{the plan to}} them more fully. He said he would pay them a cent for every two loads of stones or gravel which they should wheel in to make the causey.|$|R
50|$|The {{aviation}} researchers did {{not want}} to leave the premises which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> use after another contract signed earlier with the Admiralty. The responsible foreman V.S. Kretovich had support of counts Vladimir Alexandrovich and A.S. Apraksin. Shipbuilding was not started before Krevovich died in April 1897.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{promise not}} to bother us in the future," [...] put in Phil, who had {{followed}} Dave and Roger to a distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{his uncle}} exclaimed, as he entered, [...] "I suppose {{you have been}} sent to tell me <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of this {{rigmarole}} affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they will}} be put off if they keep this up," [...] {{answered}} Pepper. [...] "They can cheer all they please for the Dauntless eleven, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> act like gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All of a sudden," [...] ses Sam, [...] "they see <b>they</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} man wot didn't know wot fear was, {{and they}} turned round and ran off {{as hard as they}} could run. You ought to ha' been there, Ginger. You'd 'ave enjoyed it." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> their {{moorings}} {{it was too}} late to take the hatches off, and the crew sat gazing longingly at the lights ashore. Their delight when the visitor obtained permission for them to go ashore with him for a little stroll was unbounded, and they set off like schoolboys.|$|R
60|$|There was a long, {{handsome}} {{bridge over}} the river, and when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side of}} it they again travelled on a long, long way, and then once more the Foal inquired if Cinderlad saw anything. Yes, this time he saw something that looked black, far, far away, and was rather like a church tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because the East {{is grown}} up. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hustle, and the West {{is the place}} to hustle. To make money," [...] added Makely, in {{response}} to a puzzled glance of the Altrurian.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we've got one {{advantage}} over those fellows," [...] put in Colton, after the firing {{had come to}} an end, and the warship was fast getting out of range. [...] "We can run away, while <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stay right where they are." ...|$|E
60|$|Rocks {{were the}} chief {{feature of the}} scenery. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> such a height above {{the level of the}} sea that there were no pines, only a few stunted birch-trees. There was little soil, but that little was well clothed with vegetation. Rocky mountains, rocky masses, and rocky glens everywhere; but as they went farther inland the scenery {{improved}} a little.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was no good}} {{these people}} pretending {{that they did not}} {{understand}} their own language, and putting me off that way. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> understand it this time. This was no mere question of coffee and rolls; this was a serious business. I would make that waiter understand my Scandinavian, if I had to hammer it into his head with his own coffee-pot! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{armament}} of the gun-boat {{consisted of}} two nine-pounder guns, one on the forecastle, {{and one on the}} poop; one twelve-pounder, just before the bridge; and four six-pound brass carronades. These were all soon ready, but the order was not given <b>to</b> fire till <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> within a hundred yards of the pirates, who were now pelting them smartly with small arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know yet}} if my {{relations}} will like me. Anyhow, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> approve my guests. I {{wanted you to}} sell the store, because, if I'm satisfied with Langrigg, you mayn't come back. There's no real difficulty about your coming. In fact, {{you have got to}} come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{one thing}} we overlooked, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take their chances now," [...] he said. [...] "We couldn't get a team to face the smoke, and nobody could harness them if we did. If they're burned, we're going to have trouble to get the harvest in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care if they}} do. The {{houses are}} a menace to life and health. They are filthy, and if a fire ever started in them, some would prove regular traps. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] And shortly after that about a hundred were seized, and the most destroyed.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> it when a {{man came}} {{out into the open}} road. Liza quickly turned her head away.|$|R
6000|$|For a while, though, {{they stopped}} to look, now and then; {{but no more}} flashes came from the corn-field, and the boys went on cramming {{themselves}} with berries; they all said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stop, but <b>they</b> went on till Dave said: [...] "I don't believe it's going to do us any good to go in swimming if we eat too many of these mulberries. I reckon we better quit, now." ...|$|R
5000|$|We thought label wasn't {{giving us}} the support that we were due and that if they really wanted a {{commercial}} album, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> put plenty of money behind it, which with both Jeopardy and From the Lions Mouth they hadn't really done ... So when they turned around and said, 'The solution {{is for you to}} write more commercial songs', we thought, 'Fuck you', and went ahead and produced All Fall Down.|$|R
