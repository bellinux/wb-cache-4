40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if a personality test, The Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> Indicator (MBTI), <b>and</b> a career decision-making process questionnaire could be used to identify specific personality <b>types,</b> <b>and</b> examine the problems <b>and</b> influences these <b>types</b> have in the career decision-making process. The sample for this study consisted of 33 undeclared/undecided students, 25 females and 8 males, enrolled in the fall 1987 freshman and sophomore classes. Two research questions and 13 hypotheses directed this study. Research question 1 asked, "Can the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results indicated that two Myers-Briggs <b>types,</b> Feeling <b>and</b> Perceiving, appeared twice as often as other types. Research question 2 asked, "Can the career decision-making process questionnaire be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results found that Introverted types reported greater indecision and anxiety in career decision-making. Correlations between MBTI <b>types</b> <b>and</b> career influences revealed relationships between: Perceiving <b>types</b> <b>and</b> their interests, Thinking <b>types</b> <b>and</b> faculty members, Judging <b>types</b> <b>and</b> earning a degree, Feeling <b>types</b> <b>and</b> making money. Correlations between MBTI <b>types</b> <b>and</b> ideal job features found these relationships: Introverted <b>and</b> Sensing <b>types</b> <b>and</b> making money, Introverted <b>types</b> <b>and</b> security for the future, Extraverted <b>types</b> <b>and</b> being of service to others, Intuitive <b>types</b> <b>and</b> being creative, Intuitive <b>types</b> <b>and</b> leisure time, Thinking <b>types</b> <b>and</b> recognition <b>and</b> prestige, Judging <b>types</b> <b>and</b> ability, Perceiving <b>types</b> <b>and</b> personal fulfillment, recognition and prestige, and being creative...|$|R

40|$|A {{concept of}} <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts for logic {{programming}} is introduced, where <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts {{are regarded as}} constraints. Instead of defining "well-sorted" terms <b>and</b> substitutions, <b>type</b> constraints <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sort constraints are defined. The approach is based on term models. A type is interpreted {{as a set of}} object terms <b>and</b> a <b>type</b> sort is interpreted as a set of types. Parameters of types can be object variables, object terms, <b>and</b> <b>type</b> variables. Types are defined by means of type rules which can be regarded as rules for the generation of the elements belonging to the corresponding type. The definitions of <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts can be transformed into definite clauses and the least Herbrand model of these definite clauses are used for the semantics of the <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts. Type constraint processing is based on SLD-resolution with a specific computation rule. Furthermore, computing with <b>type</b> constraints <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sort constraint is discussed. 1 Introduction Structuring the univ [...] ...|$|R

The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow <b>type,</b> <b>and</b> other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the <b>type</b> <b>and</b> state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
