5|$|While the Ottomans thus {{temporarily}} therefore {{gained the}} Christian {{regions of the}} disintegrating Safavids, Yesai was blamed for this failure {{by some of the}} leaders of the Armenian army as they were forced <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for themselves against the Turkish invasions.|$|E
5|$|Imme engines {{were also}} sold <b>to</b> Fritz <b>Fend,</b> <b>to</b> power his <b>Fend</b> Flitzer invalid carriages. These {{replaced}} the Fichtel & Sachs engines used in {{earlier versions of}} the Flitzer.|$|R

50|$|Somewhere in {{the area}} is hidden a pair of Gatling guns, which would be vital <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> off such an assault. The only person who knows the hiding place is Dakota Lil, a saloonkeeper who already has lost her husband and son in battle and wants no more part of it.|$|R
5|$|Chuniya {{took the}} child to her village of Haripur and looked after him for {{five and a half}} years after which she died. Rambola was left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for himself as an impoverished orphan, and wandered from door to door begging for alms. It is {{believed}} that the goddess Parvati assumed the form of a Brahmin woman and fed Rambola every day.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off enemy torpedo boats. The calibre {{and weight of}} secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy. He said that the plan’s true purpose was <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off Communism through the economic restoration of Europe—not to provide relief to Europe (something beyond {{the powers of the}} U.S.), nor to enhance gratitude towards the U.S., its prestige or power.|$|E
50|$|In {{places where}} fewer bodies are offered, the {{vultures}} are more eager- and sometimes have <b>to</b> be <b>fended</b> off with sticks {{during the initial}} preparations.|$|R
50|$|Breeding times occur {{throughout}} the year, once the female has reached maturity. This is generally at 11 months. The male reaches maturity between 12 and 13 months. Once mature, the female {{is capable of}} breeding every three-week intervals. The gestation of the young is about 22-24 days. After the young are born they live within the pouch for about 16 weeks. Upon leaving the pouch, the Joey will stay near the mother for about 7 weeks, while it gets used <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> for itself.|$|R

5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} panel of this {{sequence}} Michelangelo combines two contrasting scenes into one panel, that of Adam and Eve taking fru{{it from the}} forbidden tree, Eve trustingly taking it from {{the hand of the}} Serpent and Adam eagerly picking it for himself; and their banishment from the Garden of Eden, where they have lived in the company of God, to the world outside where they have <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for themselves and experience death.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. <b>To</b> <b>fend</b> off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E
25|$|Biloxi {{spent the}} next three weeks {{conducting}} shore bombardment missions, including closing to within 3,000 yards of the beach and using 40mm guns to support UDT operations. Starting on 1 April, she fired on enemy targets north of the main amphibious landings and then continued these bombardment missions in support of advancing troops ashore. During these weeks, the task group was repeatedly attacked by kamikazes, one of whom just missed Biloxi on 3 April. In addition <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> off these aerial attacks, the light cruiser also fired on enemy suicide boat concentrations.|$|R

"Why, your Reverence," [...] replied Stubbs, [...] "I cannot just say--I will be sworn she was {{not born}} at Witt-ham;* for Gaffer Gibbs looked at {{her all the time}} of service, and he says, she could not turn up a single lesson like a Christian, even though she had Madge Murdockson to help her--but then, as <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> for herself, why, she's a bit of a Scotchwoman, your Reverence, and they say the worst donnot of them can look out for their own turn--and she is decently put on enow, and not bechounched like t'other." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many Flitzer buyers {{were not}} invalids but healthy people seeking basic {{personal}} transportation. [...] This led <b>Fend</b> <b>to</b> design the <b>Fend</b> 150, a larger, two-passenger car {{based on the}} concepts of the Flitzer. With mass production in mind, Fend approached Willy Messerschmitt with a proposal for Messerschmitt AG to build a more developed version of the Fend 150.|$|R
5|$|Mac Lochlainn was slain in 1166, leaving Mac Murchada <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> {{off his own}} enemies alone. Other than Mac Murchada himself, {{another man}} making a bid for the high-kingship was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1198). Within {{the same year as}} Mac Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed Mac Murchada from not only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly {{recognised}} as High King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Eid al-Fitr, the family gathers for the holiday. Unknown to the family, Soebagio is leading a double life as a robber, and that evening the police come to arrest him.

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>fend</b> off the Huns, Theodosius {{had to pay}} an {{enormous}} annual tribute to Attila.

[...] The song's subject, [...] "Miss Lonely," [...] previously opted for easy options in life—she attended the finest schools and enjoyed high-placed friends—but now that her situation has become difficult, it appears that she has no meaningful experiences to define her character.

30|$|BRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) {{was founded}} in Bangladesh, just after her {{independence}} in 1971 by (knighted) Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, who, like most antagonists of success stories, started off the project with very humble means. The 1971 war had {{an important role in}} starting national development processes (Chowdhury et al. 2013) which led a few individuals to work for BRAC rehabilitation projects in the remote north-eastern parts of Bangladesh. Later on, the founding operators of BRAC shifted their sights from a short-term relief effort to a long-term, more withstanding existence dedicated <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> off the persistent nature of endemic poverty in the country (Chowdhury and Bhuiya 2004).|$|R
50|$|At {{various times}} Vainakh {{came under the}} rule of the Sarmatian-speaking Alans to their west and Khazars to their north, in both cases as vassals or as allies {{depending}} on time period. In times of complete independence, they nonetheless tried to have strong bonds of friendship with these countries both for trade and military purposes. The Vainakh also forged strong links with Georgia for mutual protection as well as trade, and these were initially {{in the context of the}} threat of an Arab invasion (as happened to Caucasian Albania) in the 8th century. The contribution of the Vainakh <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> off Arab designs on the Caucasus was critical.|$|R
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E

30|$|Any heteroglossic {{utterance}} can {{be treated}} as either contracting or expanding the dialogic space. If it contracts the space, the utterance ‘acts <b>to</b> challenge, <b>fend</b> off or restrict’ (Martin and White [2005]: 102) other alternative positions and voices.|$|R
50|$|Freire began {{training}} Brazilian jiu-jitsu {{at the age}} of ten <b>to</b> help <b>fend</b> off {{the stigma}} of his size. As a teenager, he trained at the famed Chute Boxe academy alongside notable MMA stars such as Wanderlei Silva and Mauricio Rua.|$|R
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, they are able <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, {{all of which are}} {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5000|$|This breed has a {{calm and}} {{reserved}} reaction to threats, and is notably curious and intelligent.

They have a natural predisposition toward digging under fences and [...] "expanding their territory," [...] which needs to be monitored and controlled. [...] They are high energy [...] fit, active, vigorous defenders of the flock, and well adapted <b>to</b> <b>fending</b> off wild boar, foxes, and wolves, which are the prevalent predators in the area.
