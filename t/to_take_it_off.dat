5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, {{so that he would}} have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

25|$|The {{chaperon}} {{was one of}} {{the items}} of male clothing that featured in the charges brought against Joan of Arc at her trial in 1431.

In August 2017, {{the state of}} Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen) banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools. This {{change in the law}} was prompted by a Muslim pupil in Osnabrück who wore the garment to school for years and refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Since she has completed her schooling, the law was instituted to prevent similar cases in the future.|$|E
25|$|With the {{disruption}} of Bryansk Front, 50th Army was reassigned to Western Front. Army Group Center's supplies had been barely adequate for the encirclement phases of Typhoon, and as the autumn rains turned the roads to mud, Guderian was forced to postpone his drive on Tula until Oct. 23. The town of Chern fell on the 25th, leaving another 95km to Tula. A battlegroup, forcing its way up the one available highway, got within 5km of the city on Oct. 29 and tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the march, but the defenders were prepared and drove the panzers off with strong antitank and antiaircraft fire. 50th Army was {{in a much better}} position for supplies, with munitions coming directly from Tula's factories.|$|E

Years later, Cynthia Lennon gave back to Rhone the gold ring that McCartney had bought her in Hamburg, having once tried it on while Rhone was washing dishes, and {{forgotten}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Rhone is now a grandmother and lives in Mississauga, Ontario.|$|E

In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers. It was left to the Crown upon her death in 1901 and is {{on display at the}} Tower of London.|$|E

500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death.

500|$|A bid of £1m {{offered by}} Damien Hirst {{for the entire}} {{collection}} had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he {{knew very little about}} anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Yuly Aykhenvald derided Tolstoy's {{insistence on}} {{continuing}} with his [...] "nationalistic masquerade" [...] and quoted Anton Chekhov as commenting: [...] " [...] {{has put the}} opera costume on and forgotten <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> before leaving the theatre." [...] According to Aykhenvald, Tolstoy failed to see that [...] "the national values, when taken to the extreme, become alien-looking." [...] For Aykhenvald, though, it was Tolstoy's humour that prevented him from turning into an [...] "archeology worshipper". The critic saw Tolstoy's romanticism as universal and {{in a certain way}} religious (resulting in the fact that his most memorable character, Tsar Fyodor was [...] "an epitome of Christian meekness and grace"). Yet, [...] " [...] worshipped that kind of God who was devoid of stiffness... he was a free spirit and valued freedom most." ...|$|E

Opening {{in the summer of}} 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim, packed houses, and was held over several times.

Johnston purchased the Paisano Ranch <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the market. By 1966, the deed was handed over to the University of Texas. Its mission was stated as [...] "Paisano will be operated by the University as a permanent memorial to J.

It will be kept in its present more or less natural state and the ranch house will be kept in simple style, very much as it was when Frank Dobie occupied it."

However, she is struggles with her feelings for Toadie. Morey told TV Week that Sonya is [...] "completely in love with Toadie, but she's trying to move on as best she can – and that's where David comes into the picture." [...] Despite only being with David for three weeks, Sonya agrees to move to Perth with him. Morey said that Sonya believes she has nothing left keeping her in Erinsborough and she wants a change of scenery. Sonya chooses not to tell Toadie that she leaving, so Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) tells him instead. Steph then comes by and tells Sonya that Toadie still loves her and that their relationship is sham. Steph asks Sonya to stay if she wants more information and Steph later tells her that the baby is not Toadie's. Sonya is left shocked and relieved at the same time. Sonya agrees to wait for Toadie. When Steph's secret is eventually revealed, Sonya and Toadie start their relationship over. Morey told Herbison that due to how the relationship between Sonya and Toadie developed, it gave them a sense of history when they did finally get together.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{cocktail}} party hosted by the courtesan Magda, the poet Prunier expounds his theories on love. Magda's friends Yvette, Bianca and Suzy playfully mock him, while Lisette, Magda's maid, tells him {{he does not know}} what he is talking about. Prunier takes offence and Magda orders Lisette to leave. Prunier maintains that no one is immune to romantic love and sings the first verse of his latest song about Doretta, who rejected a king as her suitor because of the value she placed on true love. He does not know how to finish the song, so Magda takes over and provides the second verse: she recounts how Doretta {{falls in love with a}} student (Aria: Chi il bel sogno di Doretta). Magda's guests are charmed by her performance and her long-term protector Rambaldo gives her a pearl necklace. Lisette enters to announce the arrival of a young man – the son of an old school friend of Rambaldo. Lisette is ordered by Rambaldo to bring in the guest. Suddenly nostalgic, Magda recalls her life as a young working girl and happy evenings spent dancing at Bullier's, where she first experienced love (Aria: Ore dolci e divine). [...] Some of the guests suggest that Prunier should compose a song based on Magda's story but he declares a preference for songs about perverse heroines, such as Berenice or Salome. Prunier demonstrates his skills at palmistry to some of the girls, while Lisette brings in the visitor, Ruggero. He has an introduction from his father for Rambaldo. Prunier reads Magda's palm and tells her that she is like a swallow: she longs for migration towards the sun and true love. Ruggero explains that it is his first visit to Paris and asks where he may find the best place to spend an evening: after much discussion, Lisette recommends Bullier's. Ruggero leaves. Magda chides the other guests for mocking him. After they too have gone, she tells Lisette that she will remain at home that evening. Then, on a whim, she determines to disguise herself and go to Bullier's as well. She goes to get changed. Prunier returns in secret to escort Lisette to Bullier's and flirts extravagantly with her. Lisette is wearing Magda's hat and Prunier tells her that he dislikes it and orders her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> They then set out together. Magda re-enters, disguised as a working girl. She sings a fragment of Prunier's song about Doretta as she leaves, happily anticipating an adventure.|$|E
