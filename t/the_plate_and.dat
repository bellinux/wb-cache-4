5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} {{took a lot}} longer to heal than had been expected, and the team {{reported}} that they hoped {{to get him back}} in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then stepped up to <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E

5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|Tomb 4 was {{set into}} the floor of Structure 2B in the 8th century AD and is the richest burial known from Calakmul. The tomb {{contained}} a male skeleton wrapped in textiles and jaguar pelts that were partially preserved with resin. The tomb contained rich offerings that included jade ear ornaments handed down from the Early Classic, a jade mosaic mask, shell and bone beads, spiny oyster shells, eccentric obsidian blades, fine ceramics {{and the remains of}} wooden objects. One of the ceramics was a plate with a hieroglyphic text that specifically named king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' as its owner. The remains and the offering were placed in an arched wooden bier carved with elaborate decoration and hieroglyphs that was painted in a variety of colours. The bier has almost completely decayed but left an impression in the mud packed around it. Due to <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the possible association of Stelae 115 and 116 with the burial the tomb is believed to be that of the late 7th-century king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} belt filter press used for dewatering, including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> frame filter press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 2002, {{he became}} the fifth Royal in club history to record a {{straight}} steal of home and the first since Fred Patek versus Minnesota on June 18, 1977, with a stolen base off the New York Yankee's Andy Pettitte. His stolen base came on a 1-2 count with left-hander Aaron Guiel at <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> gave the Royals a 2-1 lead, but KC lost the game 3-2 in 14 innings.|$|E
25|$|Robinson's next at bat came in {{the third}} inning with two runners on base. After Sandel {{detected}} a sign that Robinson was likely to bunt, Sandel placed the ball over <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> moved forward expecting to field the ball. But Robinson swung away and hit a line drive that easily cleared the left field wall resulting in his first professional base hit: a three run home run.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{in their}} last season at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies were expected to contend for the World Series after adding such players as Jim Thome, Kevin Millwood, and David Bell {{to go along with}} the emerging nucleus of Rollins, Burrell, Wolf, and Vicente Padilla. However, Burrell and Bell slumped miserably at <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> the Phillies' inconsistent bullpen led to the team finishing 86–76 and in third place behind the Braves and eventual World Series-winning Florida Marlins.|$|E

50|$|Because flow is {{temporarily}} accelerated between <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> {{then immediately}} slows down, this helps to aggregate very fine particles that can settle as the flow exits <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting {{batteries}} are lighter weight than deep cycle batteries {{of the same}} battery dimensions, because <b>the</b> cell <b>plates</b> do not extend {{all the way to}} the bottom of the battery case. This allows loose disintegrated lead to fall off <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> collect under <b>the</b> cells, to prolong the service life of the battery. If this loose debris rises high enough it can touch <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> lead to failure of a cell, resulting in loss of battery voltage and capacity.|$|R
25|$|Moreover, the {{observed}} pressure differences between {{front and back}} of <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> resulting drag forces, are much larger than predicted: for a flat plate perpendicular to the flow the predicted drag coefficient is CD=0.88, while in experiments CD=2.0 is found. This is mainly due to suction at the wake side of the plate, induced by the unsteady flow in the real wake (as opposed to the theory which assumes a constant flow velocity equal to the plate's velocity).|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} mask from fogging up due to {{condensation}} {{on the glass}} many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> rinse {{it out with a}} little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.|$|E
25|$|The Sox {{scored a}} run in the sixth inning and it was 7–5. Pete Vuckovich started the eighth inning.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{arrangement}} of <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make <b>the</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>and</b> a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long <b>plates,</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of <b>the</b> rolled-up <b>plates,</b> not at <b>the</b> ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
