5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in the caves during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells Natural History and Archaeology Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E

5|$|The Brezhnev generation— <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> {{and worked}} during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge {{in the late}} 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile of nearly all Soviet bureaucrats {{over the age of}} 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. This generation would rule the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev are prime examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in the Baltic Sea area during the Mesolithic Era {{continues}} to be debated by scientists. From {{the middle of the}} Neolithic onwards, there is agreement to a certain extent among scholars: {{it has been suggested that}} Finno-Ugric tribes arrived in the Baltic region from the east or southeast approximately 40003000 BC by merging with the original inhabitants, who then adopted the proto-Finno-Ugric language and the Pit–Comb Ware culture of the newcomers. The members of this new Finno-Ugric-speaking ethnic group are regarded as the ancestors of modern Estonians.|$|E

25|$|The Jarabarriu, {{the final}} stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a {{dramatic}} increase in population. The settlement pattern changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller satellite communities in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and social differentiation. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in the east at Chavín de Huantar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. Satellite communities also developed centers of production during this phase.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 41 {{years before}} Guy H. Wyman platted Navarre, a small {{settlement}} named Eagan arose in 1884. The settlement, composed of 40 families, was located off the Santa Rosa Sound and encompassed {{a portion of}} present-day Navarre. The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a famous Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office’s discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued {{to live in the}} area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there at that time is unknown, the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.|$|E
25|$|Adama {{turned his}} attentions {{on the only}} major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an {{attractive}} target. It lay between Bornu {{to the north and}} Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high.|$|E

25|$|The {{mass grave}} near Schletz, part of Asparn an der Zaya, was located about 33 {{kilometres}} (roughly 20 miles) {{to the north}} of Vienna, Austria, and dates back about 7,500 years. Schletz, just like the Talheim death pit, is one of the earliest known sites in the archaeological record that shows proof of genocide in Early Neolithic Europe, among various LBK tribes. The site was not entirely excavated, but it is estimated that the entire ditch could contain up to 300 individuals. The remains of 67 people have been uncovered, all showing multiple points of trauma. Scientists have concluded that these people were also victims of genocide. Since the weapons used were characteristic of LBK peoples, the attackers are believed to be members of other LBK tribes. In similar proportions to those found at Talheim, fewer young women were found than men at Schletz. Because of this scarcity of young women among the dead, it is possible that other women of the defeated group were kidnapped by the attackers. The site was enclosed, or fortified, which serves as evidence of violent conflict among tribes and means that these fortifications were built as a form of defense against aggressors. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there had built two ditches to counter the menace of other LBK communities.|$|E
25|$|Kalas awakens in Mintaka, the Imperial capital, and {{receives}} both his Winglet and his guardian spirit back from Xelha. He also {{takes on the}} role of world-saving hero with greater enthusiasm than before, feeling he must make amends for deceiving his friends. After this, Mizuti directs the group to the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas {{at the bottom of the}} sky. The atmosphere down there has become breathable over a thousand years, but this was not always the case. Due to this, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> down there wore masks which could filter the air and make it possible to breathe. They also do not know when the air became safe to breathe. It is down here that the gang learn about the Sword of the Heavens, and that this area is Mizuti's homeland. Sadly, the Sword of the Heavens had been stolen by Krumly, who resented the role of guardians that the children of the Earth have inherited for generations. He therefore attempted a ritual to a pierce a hole in the Taintcoluds and beg Malpercio to release the children of the Earth from their duty. This turns out to be a mistake as Melodia and Malpercio rampage through Krumly's village. The village is saved by a last minute intervention from Kalas and the gang, but the Sword of the Heavens is broken.|$|E
500|$|The Ancestral Puebloans {{relied on}} regular {{rainfall}} {{to sustain their}} agricultural society. This proved challenging in Chaco Canyon, even with consistent precipitation. By 1130, the rains had diminished and the maize crops that the Chacoans depended on had begun to fail, as the region increasingly suffered {{from the effects of}} a devastating, fifty-year drought. After a continuous occupation of more than six hundred years, the Chacoans began to migrate from the canyon. Fagan states that by 1140 [...] "Chaco was finished". A study of 12th-century burials in the Gallup, New Mexico, area indicates as many as half of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> during the drought died before the age of eighteen, with sixty percent of all deaths occurring before age thirty-five.
