40|$|Manufacturing a {{titanium}} monophosphide (<b>TiP)</b> <b>layer</b> on a substrate (12) comprises: (a) depositing a TiN layer from TiCl 4 and NH 3 {{supplied to}} a reactor (14); and (b) heating the TiN, while supplying PH 3 into the reactor immediately after TiN deposition, {{to form a}} <b>TiP</b> <b>layer</b> on the TiN layer. Preferably, the substrate (12) is a silicon wafer and the two steps are carried out at not more than 450 deg. C and at a basic pressure of 0. 5 - 5 (preferably 2) mPa. USE - A double layer of TiN and TiP {{is used as a}} diffusion barrier layer between a semiconductor material and a metallisation (claimed), e. g. between silicon and aluminium. ADVANTAGE - The <b>TiP</b> <b>layer</b> is produced in the same reactor as that used for TiN deposition and is formed from phosphine which acts as a more active getter for chlorine than does NH 3 and which also can act as a getter for oxygen, so that the resulting diffusion barrier layer has improved properties...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{metallurgical}} {{properties of}} the Ti/InP system meet a great interest for its use as a contact in the scope of various applications such as the Si Photonics. The investigations conducted on this system highlight the initiation of a reaction between the Ti and the InP substrate during the deposition process conducted at 100 °C. The simultaneous formation of two binary phases, namely, Ti$_ 2 $In$_ 5 $ and TiP, is attributed to the compositional gradient induced in the InP by the wet surface preparation and enhanced by the subsequent $in situ$ Ar$^+$ preclean. Once formed, the <b>TiP</b> <b>layer</b> acts as a diffusion barrier inhibiting further reaction up to 450 °C {{in spite of the}} presence of an important Ti reservoir. At higher temperature, however, i. e., from 550 °C, the reaction is enabled either by the enhancement of the species diffusion through the <b>TiP</b> <b>layer</b> or by its agglomeration. This reaction gives rise to the total consumption of the Ti$_ 2 $In$_ 5 $ and Ti while the TiP and In phases are promoted...|$|R

The so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested tip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct elongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate the structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified experimentally. The LES is shown to reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative agreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core patterns observed {{in the field in}} the <b>tip</b> shear <b>layer.</b> We show that the visualized vortex patterns are the result of energetic coherent dynamics in the rotor <b>tip</b> shear <b>layer</b> driven by interactions between the tip vortices and a second set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip vortices. We further show that the mean flow within the region where such rich coherent dynamics occur satisfies the instability criterion proposed by Leibovich and Stewartson (J.

40|$|The linear four-point probe {{method is}} useful to measure the resistivity, by passing a current I 14 through the outer probes and by {{measuring}} the voltage V 23 between the inner probes. The contacts are on a line and denoted by 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. The sheet resistance for thin layers with thickness t is Rsh = ¿/t (O). The sheet resistance is measured as Rsh = (V 23 /I 14). C 23 where the correction factor is C 23 = p/ln 2 = 4. 53 for t smaller than s, the distance between probe points. In order to characterize the 1 /f noise of a film with a four-point probe we need noise correction factors for the calculation of the conductance noise from the voltage noise between the pair of points, where the current is not passed through. Our calculations of the noise correction factors {{are based on the}} general theory for conductance noise investigations with four arbitrarily shaped and placed electrodes. Analytical expressions for noise correction factors Fij and fij are derived and compared with experimental results for the three cases. The subscripts of F and f denote the voltage sensor contacts. The following cases are investigated: 1) I 14 and V 23, 2) I 13 and V 24 and 3) I 12 and V 34. The subscripts in I and V denote the current driver contacts and voltage sensor contacts, respectively. From the calculations and experimental results it follows that: i) case 1 (I 14 and V 23) is the best choice in order to suppress a non-intentional noise contribution from the interface between probe <b>tip</b> and <b>layer,</b> ii) the reciprocity relation is applicable to voltage noise due to conductance fluctuations. The voltage noise SV 23 that is observed by passing a constant current I 14 through the pair of probes 1, 4 is equal to the voltage noise SV 14 if we pass the same current through the contacts 2, 3. The four-point probe method with the noise correction factors can be recommended to investigate e. g., the conductance noise of conductive polymer layers even with an insulating top layer and without the preparation of rectangular samples with perfect noise-free line contacts. The four-point probe can punch an insulating top layer and allows the measurement of sheet resistance and noise. Several tests show that the noise contributions from the interface between probe <b>tip</b> and <b>layer</b> are negligible.

A micro field emitter has a cathode <b>tip,</b> insulating <b>layer,</b> metal gate, sandwich structure. This structure is fabricated on a silicon substrate. The tip normally has {{a tenth of a}} nanometer apex radius, and is separated from the surrounding gate electrode by a space, ranging from sub-micron to several microns in width, where a high electric field is formed. The micro field emitter is capable of delivering electrons into the surrounding vacuum. The emitted electron current is governed by the Fowler-Nordheim theory. A new fabrication technique for producing arrays of silicon nanotips with precise control of tip size and geometry, without the need for a conventional oxidation sharpening process, was developed. Gated micro field emitter arrays were fabricated using an electron beam evaporation technique. Also volcano shaped micro field emitters were fabricated using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and etch back techniques. Silicon based gated field emitters with tungsten coating, silicon carbide coating and diamond like carbide coating were produced for evaluation. Field emission studies from these micro field emitters were carried out in ultra high vacuum systems. The current/voltage characteristic, emission current stability, field emission spatial distribution, and the field emission pressure dependence were investigated. Failures of devices were investigated and the failure mechanisms were drawn out. A feedback back control circuit was designed and built to control the field emission current fluctuation and stabilized emission current from the micro field emitters was obtained. Various suggestions for developing the entire miniature scanning electron microscope are made and future work for studying the micro field emitters is proposed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspects of}} the use of magnetic force microscopy for the study of magnetic recording media. The maximum achievable storage density in magnetic recording is limited by the magnetic reversal behaviour of the medium and by the stability of the written information. The shape and size of the small magnetic units (bits as wen as domaiDs) in the media is strongly correlated to the microstructure of the layers. Surface roughness, colurnnar structure of the layer, segregation of the elements inside the crystallites as wen as surface and volume defects influence {{the size and shape of}} the magnetic structures in the layer. The physicallimit for the bit size is estimated to be about 50 x 50 Dm. Such an increase in bit writing density requires a magnetic microscopy technique which can image magnetic details of about 10 Dm size. The advantage of magnetic force microscopy for this purpose lies in the easy sample preparation, combined with a high achievable resolution. In Chapter 2 we have discussed the optimisation of the tip shape, the tip magnetic properties as weIl as the detection mode in order to reach the required resolution. It is shown there that an elongated magnetic needIe can combine a sufficient volume with a small tip front end and is therefore superior to a soft tip which should have a spherical shape. Por the bar type tip we have calculated a one-dimensional transfer function which relates the spatial frequency components of the force (or force deri vati ve) to the spatial frequency components of the sample magnetisation distribution. This transfer function depends on the sample thickness, the <b>tip</b> magnetic <b>layer</b> thickness, the <b>tip</b> length and the tip sample separation and shows a behaviour very similar to the readback frequency characteristics of a magnetic recording channel. With a given detector sensitivity a minimum detectable wavelength Ac can be determined from the transfer function which serves as a measure for the comparison of different detection modes. Prom this comparison, for maximum resolution an MFM should be operated in a constant distance dynamic mode with a low oscillation amplitude. The tip has to have a high Ms and Hc. The tip coercivity has to be a result of the shape anisotropy due to the high aspect ratio of the needIe like magnetic <b>tip</b> <b>layer.</b> In Chapter 3 the instrumentation of an S FM scan head is described. This scan head win be applied for MFM measurements in extemal magnetic fields of arbitrary direction with respect to the sample. Por this purpose it has to be operated between the poles of a resisti ve electromagnet in a vacuum in order to increase the Q factor of the resonating cantilever. in dynamic detection mode. The properties of the scan head are: -Extemal magnetic field: continuously between - 1. 8 T and 1. 8 T, with a 1 p pm long term stability -Scan range: about 40 ~m -Detection limit: 0. 1 Dm in a 1 kHz bandwidth -Scan head size: 26 x 30 x 42 mm -Complete software control of the whole instrument The instrument is controlled by two digital signal processor (DSP) boards. One of them generates the scan signals, the second board is responsible for the detection and feedback. Chapter 4 describes the fabrication and magnetic properties of magnetic tips made from electron beam assisted deposited carbon needIes. The carbon needIes are grown in a SEM where the hydrocarbon gas contamination originating from the diffusion pump is locaIly cracked by the electron beam. These carbon needIes are very weIl suited for evaporating magnetic materia! as Co or CogoNi 2 o onto their side. This way a tip shape very similar to the bar type tip as described in Chapter 2 can be created. Lorentz electron microscopy images prove a single domain behaviour of the tip in extemal fields up to about 0. 2 T. For higher fields the tip is split up into two antiparallel magnetic domains. This contiguration remained stabIe even in remanent states. At no time did the tip front end contain more than one domain. On a Co-Ni/Pt multilayer sample we could observe magnetic structures smaller than 30 nm dimension with EBill magnetic tips in a constant force derivative detection mode. Chapter 5 describes the application of magnetic force microscopy for the characterisation of magnetic recording media. First of a!l the techniques used for the quantification of data from MFM images are presented. We used a thresholding a!gorithm to estimate the underlying magnetisation pattem from the constant signa! MFM images. We have used Fourier descriptors to characterise the jaggedness of the boundary of magneto- optica! bits as weIl as of conventional bits. This a!lows a comparison of bits in different materials, written under the same settings as weIl as different writing conditions on the same media. The principle of this technique is shown in an example of magneto- optical bits. Furthermore, Chapter 5 gives examples of results on magnetic recording media which were gained by MFM. The influence of the sputtering bias voltage on the magnetic structures of Co-Ni/Pt multilayers bas been shown. On ME tape the edge overwrite behaviour has been studied as weIl as the difference in bit structure when the bits were written in the direction of the colurnnar inclination or antiparallel to it. Furthermore the the writing behaviour of a CoCrTa perpendicular materia! bas been investigated. 400 nm wide bit tracks of 200 kfrpi (127 nm bit length) have been studied in this materia!. AFM observations of the sample surface topography show that the smallest observed bits still contain about 30 crysta 1 lites. The maximum linear bit density we could observe in this materia! was 300 kfrpi (85 nm bit length). Here the bit period is smallerthan the domain size ofthe surrounding remanent domain pattem.

40|$|High Rayleigh number (4 x 104 - 3 × 107) quasi-two-dimensional {{convection}} is studied experimentally, numerically, and theoretically. The fluid {{is contained}} in an isothermal Hele-Shaw cell, which enforces the two dimensionality, and the convection is driven by an externally imposed vertical concentration gradient. The full two dimensional concentration field is imaged experimentally and is sampled at regular intervals spanning between five and fifty convective times (the time it takes a plume to cross the cell). The most prominent and dynamically significant features of the flow are solutal plumes which form within the concentration boundary <b>layer.</b> <b>Tip</b> splitting of plumes leading to smaller length scales and merging of plumes leading to larger length scales are observed. A model of Hele-Shaw convection, which includes a friction term due to the boundaries parallel to the velocity field, is simulated. The evolution of the pattern and dynamics of the concentration field, as well as time averaged spatial spectra, are obtained from the experiment and simulation. Results for exponents which describe how the Nusselt number and Reynolds number scale with Rayleigh number are obtained theoretically and compared with the values from simulation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{conceptual}} growth {{models for}} faults in layered sequences suggest that faults first localise in strong, and brittle, layers and are later linked in weak, and ductile, layers. We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for modelling {{the growth of}} a normal fault in a brittle/ductile multilayer sequence. The modelling reveals that faults in brittle/ductile sequences at low confining pressure and high strength contrast localise first as Mode I fractures in the brittle layers. Low amplitude monoclinal folding prior to failure is accommodated by ductile flow in the weak layers. The initially vertically segmented fault arrays are later linked via shallow dipping faults in the weak layers. Faults localise, therefore, as geometrically and kinematically coherent arrays of fault segments in which abandoned fault tips or splays are a product of the strain localisation process and do not necessarily indicate linkage of initially isolated faults. The modelling suggests that fault <b>tip</b> lines in <b>layered</b> sequences are more advanced in the strong layers compared to weak layers, where the difference in propagation distance is most likely related to strength and/or ductility contrast. Layer dependent variations in fault propagation rates generate fringed rather than smooth fault tip lines in multilayers...|$|R
