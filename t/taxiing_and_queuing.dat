40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} all taxi drivers adopt a profit {{maximization}} strategy when searching for customers. Some taxi drivers {{are provided with}} real-time information on customer <b>and</b> <b>taxi</b> <b>queue</b> lengths at all taxi stands while others have no information at all. The questions to be investigated are: (1) will equipped taxi drivers earn a higher profit compared to the uninformed taxi drivers? (2) What {{is the impact of}} real-time information provision to a portion of all the taxi drivers on the overall taxi system performance? To find answers to these questions, a case study is conducted by assuming a hypothetical linear city with a single city centre, ten <b>taxi</b> stands <b>and</b> twenty residential zones. A discrete-event dynamic simulation model is adopted to simulate the movements of <b>taxis</b> <b>and</b> to estimate various taxi system performance characteristics, such as <b>taxi</b> operation profit <b>and</b> customer waiting time. The time period simulated is a 3 -hour morning commune. The taxi fleet size, fare structure, <b>taxi</b> operation cost <b>and</b> customer demand pattern are all assumed given. The simulation model is used to investigate the variation of taxi system performance with the proportion of informed taxi drivers in the taxi fleet. published_or_final_versionThe 12 th World Conference of Transport Research (WCTR 2010), Lisbon, Portugal, 11 - 15 July 2010...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{application}} {{that uses a}} predictive queueing model to efficiently allocate taxis. The system uses observed <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> flight data {{at each of the}} four terminals of Singapore’s Changi Airport to estimate the expected waiting time <b>and</b> <b>queue</b> length for <b>taxis</b> arriving at these terminals, <b>and</b> then sends <b>taxis</b> to terminals where demand is highest. We propose a service model that enables our system to be deployed on a smartphone platform to participating taxi drivers. We present the theoretical details which underpin our prediction engine and corroborate our theory with several targeted numer-ical simulations. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this system in large-scale experiments and show that our system achieves a significant improvement in both passenger <b>and</b> <b>taxi</b> waiting time.

40|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from {{the review of}} the Victorian taxi industry, the objective of this project was to evaluate the appropriateness of current <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car age limits in ensuring safety of the <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car fleets. The aim was also to identify and analyse all associated issues including safety that the Taxi Services Commission (TSC) should consider in setting age limits for <b>taxis</b> <b>and</b> hire cars into the future. The project used a two phase methodology to meet these objectives. Phase one involved extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders in the <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car industries to determine issues relevant to the choice and operation of vehicles as <b>taxis</b> <b>and</b> hire cars. The second phase involved extensive analysis of the safety performance of the <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car fleet including the risk of crash involvement and injury outcomes related to vehicle choice {{in the event of a}} crash. The analysis then examined the relationship between these factors, taxi or hire car type and vehicle age. The safety performance was then used to construct an analytical model to test the influence of various scenarios not only for changes in <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car age limits but also scenarios related to safer vehicle choice and reduced vehicle crash risk related to improvements in driving standards. Finally, the economic worth of each of the scenarios considered was estimated in order to identify the most cost-effective strategies for improving the future safety of the <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car fleet. Recommendations for future policy on <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> hire car age limits, vehicle choice and driver focused interventions were made and priorities for further research identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} role that taxis play in bringing passengers from an airport terminal to their final destination is often overlooked in airport operations and design. Due to varying flight arrival patterns at different terminals, taxi drivers are often unsure which terminal they should queue at. In this thesis, we present ChangiNOW, a mobile app {{that uses a}} predictive queueing model to efficiently allocate taxis. The ChangiNOW system uses observed <b>taxi</b> <b>and</b> flight data {{at each of the}} four terminals of Singapores Changi Airport to estimate the expected waiting time <b>and</b> <b>queue</b> length for <b>taxis</b> arriving at these terminals, <b>and</b> then sends <b>taxis</b> to terminals where waiting time is shortest. The app communicates this information to taxi drivers in a visually intuitive and appealing way, motivating them to service those terminals with the highest taxi demand. We present the theoretical details that underpin our prediction engine and validate our theory with several targeted numerical simulations. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this system in large-scale experiments and show that our system achieves a significant improvement in both passenger <b>and</b> <b>taxi</b> waitin...|$|R
