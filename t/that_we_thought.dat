According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over.

500|$|In 1997, the Strokes {{consisted}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E

Locations included Burbank, Downey, New York City, LA/Ontario International Airport (which doubled for Miami International Airport), Quebec City and Montreal. The film {{was shot in}} 147 locations in only 52 days. DiCaprio reflected, [...] "Scenes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> would take three days took an afternoon". Filming ran from April 25–30 in Park Avenue, just outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Production moved to Orange, New Jersey and returned to Brooklyn for bank and courthouse scenes. Shooting also {{took place at the}} TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Quebec City was chosen for its European character and French feel. Place Royale, within Old Quebec, stands for Montrichard—the church in the background of the arrest scene is Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. Filming ended on May 12 in Montreal.|$|E
500|$|On August 22, 2015, Beholder {{became the}} first filly or mare to win the Grade I Pacific Classic against males. She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I think they were telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. [...] They also suggested that she might race again in 2016 and that upon retirement, Hughes would be likely to keep her at his Spendthrift Farm and not offer her for sale.|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an event}} in September 2013, Mohanlal {{announced}} that the film will start in February 2014. In March 2014, it was reported the filming will begin in {{the second week of}} April 2014. Principal photography began in mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala. Two sequences in the filma fight and an item song, which are taking place in the U. S. was shot in a set created inside the compound of The Raviz Hotel, Kollam. The Kollam schedule was completed on 8 May 2014. Filming in Kollam for a film set in America, was criticized by some medias in Kerala. Replying to it Vaidyanathan said in an interview: [...] "If you are making Titanic, you don't have to build an entire ship and make it sink. The news of us shooting in the U.

2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> could use such a machine. I would like {{to tell you that the}} machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E

Either of these [...] deserves accountability." [...] He said that Defence Minister Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi had informed the Iraqi Parliament during emergency parliamentary hearings in 2009 that [...] "the detection of car bombs and explosive material using these devices is very limited, and this increases the likelihood that these devices have low efficiency." ...|$|E
