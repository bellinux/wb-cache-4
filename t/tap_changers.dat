50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> physically {{makes the}} new connection before releasing the old using multiple tap selector switches but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} diverter switch to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> mechanism of a transformer implementation in an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for on load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby {{eliminating the need for}} separate <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control equipment. The monitoring mechanism has been implemented in a 28 MVA, 110 / 6. 9 kV transformer with 16 tap position with GE make T 60 IED at Ultratech cement limited Gulbarga, Karnataka and is in successful service.

50|$|If {{only one}} <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is required, {{manually}} operated tap points are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the primary winding and an on load automatic <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low voltage tap may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the low-voltage (secondary winding) network.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{can play}} a vital role in its {{application}} to on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> of distribution transformers since the input variation in practical field is enormous due to continuous changes in the power system conditions and neural network is capable of handling this variation due to its robust generalization capability. In this paper we use the two algorithms, namely, scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and Bayesian regularization (BR) for training an ANN to control the automatic on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> of two parallel transformers connected across the power network. Primarily five data sets are constructed considering voltage phase angle differences between the sources feeding the primary windings while the secondaries are connected in paralleling mode. For each data set, accuracy in ANN based <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> decision is investigated and BR algorithm yields better results than SCG algorithm. In the second stage, another combined data set is formed by analyzing the trend of false responses in primary results. Results show significant improvement in performance when combined data set is used for training. With this data set, difference in performance between BR and SCG algorithms reduces, however BR still performs better with significantly high accuracy in <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> operation.

50|$|No load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> {{are often}} {{utilized}} in {{situations in which}} a transformers turn ratio does not require frequent changing and it is permissible to de-energize the transformer system. This type of transformer is frequently employed in low power, low voltage transformers in which the tap point often may {{take the form of}} a transformer connection terminal, requiring the input line to be disconnected by hand and connected to the new terminal. Alternatively, in some systems, the process of tap changing may be assisted by means of a rotary or slider switch.|$|E

In those research works the proposed ANN for application in this control were developed using various algorithms and concluded that a network trained by Bayesian Regularization (BR) backpropagation algorithm produced the best performance {{measured in terms of}} correct tap changing decisions. However, further improvement of ANN based transformer <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> operation is always desirable.

50|$|This is a {{relatively}} recent development which uses thyristors both to switch the transformer winding taps and to pass the load current in the steady state. The disadvantage is that all non-conducting thyristors connected to the unselected taps still dissipate power due to their leakage currents and they have limited short circuit tolerance. This power consumption {{can add up to}} a few kilowatts which appears as heat and causes a reduction in overall efficiency of the transformer; however, it results in a more compact design that reduces the size and weight of the tap changer device.
