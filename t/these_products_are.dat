5|$|Other {{than the}} Octopus card itself, {{operator}} Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The mobile phone covers were {{specifically designed for}} Nokia models 3310 and 3330, and iPhone 4 and 4S. As with the card itself, <b>these</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> used by waving them over a card reader. They may be reloaded with money value {{the same way as}} the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes. An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card. <b>These</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} <b>these</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E
