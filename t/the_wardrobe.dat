5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were brought to the attention of King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe.</b> The position was an important one; <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, suspecting that <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> {{contains}} the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe.</b> George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe,</b> joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of <b>the</b> <b>Wardrobe</b> and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. <b>The</b> <b>Wardrobe</b> had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had managed}} this last {{category}} of personal treasure through an organisation called <b>the</b> Privy <b>Wardrobe.</b> <b>The</b> Keeper of <b>the</b> Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> {{was responsible for}} guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as gifts to the monarch's family and friends. <b>The</b> Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France. This probably encouraged the King to decide {{to build a new}} tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of <b>the</b> Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate. In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, vestments and similar goods belonging to the royal household– effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.|$|R

5|$|William {{was also}} placed {{in charge of}} vacant ecclesiastical offices, {{collecting}} their revenues for the king. He performed this office for the Diocese of Worcester around 1200, the Diocese of Winchester in 1204, for Glastonbury Abbey in 1205, and for Whitby Abbey in 1206 and 1209. From his actions it can be assumed that Wrotham {{was a member of}} the royal household, probably working in <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It {{is likely that the}} clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the money raised was paid into <b>the</b> <b>Wardrobe,</b> the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|After 1223, Jocelin was a baron of the exchequer. In 1225 {{he served}} the king {{as head of}} one of the {{receivers}} of the tax of a fifteenth. After the dismissal of Walter Mauclerk as treasurer, at first Jocelin, along with Richard Poore, the Bishop of Durham, took over many of the treasurers functions, but this did not last long, and after 1233, Jocelin no longer was involved with financial affairs. He occasionally witnessed charters, however. After the fall of Peter des Roches in April 1234, Jocelin was given control of <b>the</b> <b>Wardrobe.</b> After this, he appears less regularly in royal government, but he did witness the reconfirmation of Magna Carta in 1237.|$|E
50|$|Bokyngham {{entered the}} {{treasury}} and was appointed Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1347 (until 1350), Keeper of <b>the</b> Great <b>Wardrobe</b> in 1350 (until 1353), Keeper of <b>the</b> (Household) <b>Wardrobe</b> in 1353 (until 1357) and a Baron of the Exchequer in 1357 (until 1360).|$|R
50|$|By the 14th century, the Tower of London {{had become}} well {{established}} as a convenient and safe place for storage of arms and armour, jewels and plate; so when <b>the</b> Great <b>Wardrobe</b> departed these items stayed put. Arms had been manufactured within the Tower since the previous century; <b>the</b> local <b>wardrobe</b> staff had valuable experience and the Tower itself was strategically well-placed for fast distribution. Already in the 1330s, prior to the departure of <b>the</b> Great <b>Wardrobe,</b> <b>the</b> local 'Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> at <b>the</b> Tower' had begun to specialize in this work, and after 1361 it, in turn, took on a degree of financial and administrative independence (becoming directly accountable to the Exchequer rather than the royal household). It was superseded in the mid-15th century by the Office of Armoury and the Office of Ordnance (both also based at the Tower), whereupon <b>the</b> Privy <b>Wardrobe's</b> funding ceased and it largely faded from influence (though it continued to have a nominal role until {{the latter part of}} the same century).|$|R

5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|In April 1553 Dudley was {{commanded}} by the King to release {{cloth of silver}} and gold and velvet for the marriage of his nephew Lord Guildford to Lady Jane Grey, which was celebrated on 25 May. In June, Jehan de Scheyfve reported that Dudley himself would marry Margaret Clifford, a granddaughter of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and cousin of Lady Jane, {{and that he would}} be made Lieutenant-Governor of the North. Dudley had even reserved a number of items from <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> at Westminster for the marriage, including jewels, silver and gilt cups, a hair-brush, velvet dog-collars, and a pair of pictures of Diana and Actaeon. However, Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, having named Lady Jane Grey as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and <b>the</b> <b>Wardrobe</b> and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E
50|$|In July 1323, John Fleet was {{appointed}} 'Keeper {{of the part}} of <b>the</b> King's <b>Wardrobe</b> in <b>the</b> Tower of London'.

5|$|More {{problems}} ensued during filming: Paul Le Mat {{was sent}} to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions {{to the top of the}} local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss' forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|Outside, Cook and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) try {{to sneak}} into the girls' party. Cook enters the house through a window, but accidentally locks himself inside a wardrobe. After calling his friend, Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), for help, JJ goes into the house by himself and sees Emily and Naomi kissing. Katie, too, {{witnesses}} the pair kissing, but is interrupted when her footballer boyfriend, Danny Guillermo (Henry Garrett), and dozens of his friends arrive at the house to crash the party. Hiding {{from the rest of}} the party, Effy finds Cook, and they have sex in <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe.</b> They fall through the wall into the next room and find a DVD which shows Angela having sex with her older neighbour, Martin (James Fleet). Freddie comes to take JJ home and confronts Effy about leaving Pandora for Cook. As he leaves, so does Effy.|$|E
5|$|William Edington (died 6 or 7 October 1366) was an English {{bishop and}} administrator. He served as Bishop of Winchester from 1346 until his death, Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> from 1341 to 1344, {{treasurer}} from 1344 to 1356, and finally as chancellor from 1356 until {{he retired from}} royal administration in 1363. Edington's reforms of the administration– in particular of royal finances– had wide-ranging consequences, {{and contributed to the}} English military efficiency {{in the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. As Bishop of Winchester he was responsible for starting an extensive rebuilding of Winchester Cathedral, and for founding Edington Priory, the church of which still stands today.|$|E

5|$|Adding to the film's $225 {{million budget}} (almost $100 million {{of which were}} spent on the effects), Disney also spent $175 million on {{promoting}} the film. Play Along Toys created a playset of Miraz's castle, a series of 3¾-inch and 7-inch action figures, and roleplaying costumes. Weta Workshop's Collectibles unit also created statues, busts and helmets based on their props for the film, {{and there was also}} a Monopoly edition based on the film. In the UK, Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools, which are available from the official UK Narnia website. In June 2008, the Journey into Narnia: Prince Caspian Attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios, featuring a recreation of the Stone Table, behind-the-scenes footage, concept art, storyboards, props and costumes from the film. The tone of the film's marketing focused on the film's action, and unlike The Lion, the Witch and <b>the</b> <b>Wardrobe</b> Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible-based study guides in North America.|$|E
5|$|Because Pride and Prejudice was {{a period}} drama, the design {{required}} more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while {{trying to make the}} clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.|$|E
5|$|After the war Knight {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing the work of <b>the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting {{large parts of the}} canvas, the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year Knight {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2. Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of Jean Rhodes, a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the Royal Opera House during performances and rehearsals by the Bolshoi Ballet.|$|E
