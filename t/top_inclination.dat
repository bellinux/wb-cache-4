40|$|Abstract: Damage {{recognition}} and diagnosis for large-scale structures on line need suitable models and practical algorithms, which have less computational complexity and demand less memory, {{to be realized}} by microcontroller or microcomputer. In this paper, the AR(n) time series model and the recursive least square method are chosen to establish the dynamic model for the monitoring data of the tower crane’s <b>top</b> <b>inclination.</b> A judgment criterion for steel structural sound condition of tower crane is proposed. The Time Series Stiffness Spacing Model (TSSSM) is established according to the feature model of the tower crane’s <b>top</b> <b>inclination</b> under the normal condition. The experimental {{results show that the}} model can accurately identify the steel structural sound condition of the tower crane. So the model has the practical value for damage alarming online. 1...|$|E

40|$|Negative {{differential}} resistance (NDR) with room temperature peak-valley-ratio of 8 {{has been observed}} in a ballistic field-effect-transistor (FET) based on graphene, having an oblique top gate. Graphene FETs with a <b>top</b> gate <b>inclination</b> angle of 45 degrees and a drain-source distance of 400 nm were fabricated on a chip cut from a 4 inch graphene wafer grown by CVD. From the 60 measured devices, NDR was observed only in the regions where the CVD graphene displays the Raman signature of defectless monolayers. In other specific positions on the wafer, where graphene quality was not high enough and the Raman signature indicated the presence of defects, the ballistic character of transport is lost and the graphene FETs display nonlinear drain-voltage dependences tuned by the top and back gate voltage...|$|R
40|$|Stability and {{buoyancy}} loss {{is a very}} current {{problem for}} semi-submersible platforms. New ballast system designs are developed to improve the safety of personnel and facility, but {{the effect of these}} is difficult to measure and document towards operators and authorities. The ultimate objective of this thesis has been to compare three modern ballast system designs with a fourth conventional system with respect to risk of stability and buoyancy loss. Fault tree analysis has been the main tool to establish failure frequencies for the defined <b>top</b> event unintended <b>inclination</b> induced or not corrected by ballast system. The systems have been evaluated for implementation on a semi-submersible production rig. Hydrostatic analyses for different relevant stability scenarios have been carried out as part of the consequence assessment. The final results indicate that an improved ballast system design can reduce the risk of stability loss by up to 40 %, {{and at the same time}} decrease the capital cost for the system dramatically. </p...|$|R
