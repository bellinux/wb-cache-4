5|$|II (Sturm)./JG 4 {{took off}} for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they {{stumbled}} upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> damaged, {{as well as two}} trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine was probably a Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{losses are}} given at Evere as 32 fighters, 22 <b>twin-engine</b> <b>{{aircraft}}</b> and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single, six twin and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only {{one of them was}} captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|JG 3 claimed 53 {{single-engine}} and 11 <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> destroyed. Five {{fighters and}} one four-engine bomber were also claimed damaged. Four Typhoons, three Spitfires, one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down. All in all, JG 3 managed to destroy 43 aircraft according to British records, and damage a further 60, some seriously. The Geschwader believed it had destroyed 116. JG 3 {{did not come}} away unscathed. I./JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots, a 50% loss rate. Damage to the returning Gruppe aircraft meant the entire unit was unserviceable. RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five. JG 3 lost, altogether, 15 of the 60 fighters sent, a 25% loss rate. Some 15 pilots were missing; nine were killed and five captured, and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown. Another source says 16 pilots; ten killed or missing and six captured.|$|E
25|$|The Queensland {{government}} {{bought a}} single-engine aircraft for the Premier's use in November 1971, upgrading it to a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> in 1973 and even bigger model in 1975.

25|$|The Diamond DA42 Twin Star is a four seat, twin engine, propeller-driven {{airplane}} developed {{manufactured by}} Austrian company Diamond Aircraft Industries. It was Diamond's first twin engine design, {{as well as}} the first new European <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> in its category to be developed in over 25 years. During 2004, the DA42 became the first diesel-powered fixed-wing aircraft to perform a non-stop crossing of the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|According to Jane's, {{development}} of the subsystems, including an engine with thrust vectoring capability, and weapon suite {{for the next generation}} fighter had been under development. A photograph of a wind tunnel model published with the article showed a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> with twin vertical tail fins. The aircraft would carry its weapons internally like the F-22 Raptor. New Scientist called attention to the angular, faceted features of the design, comparing them to the F-117 Nighthawk.|$|E
25|$|Hans Jeschonnek {{initially}} opposed Milch's planned production increases. But in June, {{he changed}} his mind and suggested 900 fighters per month should be the average output. By the winter of 1941–1942, just 39% of the fighter force was operational and possessed just 60 more combat aircraft than it did in June 1941, despite its increased commitments. Throughout 1942, the Luftwaffe was out-produced in fighter aircraft by 250% and in <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> by 196%.|$|E

The Kanpur unit of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd will manufacture these planes,” The 14-seater <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> would be used for coastal surveillance as well as training young cadets on transport flying. The second prototype of the aircraft is overweight by 500kg against the specified design weight of 4125kg. The third prototype has yet to take flight.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a {{rearmament}} {{study by}} the Air Force perceived {{the need for a}} new fighter capable of reaching Mach 2 in horizontal flight and a rate of climb that allowed it to reach 40,000ft in less than five minutes. The study also gave preference to <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and specified the armament capacity and the capability to operate in hot environments, in addition to being capable of flying directly from mainland Portugal to Sal, Cape Verde. The preferred contenders at the time were the Dassault Mirage III, Dassault Mirage 5, Northrop F-5A, and McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom II.|$|E
25|$|Engines grow {{in power}} with development, but a major war demands the utmost {{performance}} from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service {{was unlikely to}} exceed 50 hour's flying, {{over a period of}} only a month or two. In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800's reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the Douglas DC-6, Martin 4-0-4, and Convair 240 transports. The last two were <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 and the first Constellations.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the Hampden and Wellington, {{which had}} met Specification B.9/32 {{for a day}} bomber, the Whitley was always {{intended}} for night operations alone and thus escaped the early heavy losses received during daylight raids carried out upon German shipping. As {{the oldest of the}} three bombers, the Whitley was effectively obsolete by the start of the war, yet over 1,000 more aircraft were produced before a suitable replacement was found. A particular problem with the <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> was that it could not maintain altitude on one engine. Whitleys flew a total of 8,996 operations with Bomber Command, dropped 9,845tons (8,931tonnes) of bombs, and 269 aircraft were lost in action.|$|E
25|$|The Alpha Jet {{is a light}} <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{equipped}} with an intentionally simple airframe despite the performance delivered. Both the leading edges and air intakes are fixed; while the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft, which was developed {{with the aid of}} computer aided design (CAD), conforms with the area rule. Fully powered controls are used, comprising a dual-hydraulic systems and load-factor limited dynamic feel system arrangement attached to conventional flight control surfaces. The cockpit is pressurised for greater comfort during training. The Alpha Jet is designed to accommodate ten-minute turn around times with minimal ground equipment, using features such as pressurised single-point refueling, ladder-less entering/egress of the cockpit, and a ten-hour endurance of the liquid oxygen system.|$|E
25|$|The Curtiss C-46 Commando {{began to}} fly India-China {{missions}} in May 1943. The C-46 {{was a large}} <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> capable of flying faster and higher than any previous medium-range cargo aircraft, and could carry heavier loads than either the C-47 or the C-87, albeit at two and one half times the unit cost for a C-47. With the C-46, airlift tonnage increased significantly, surpassing objectives with 12,594 tons in December 1943. Loads continued to increase throughout 1944 and 1945, reaching an all-time maximum tonnage in July 1945. Performance of the Commando was enhanced when camouflage paint, standard on all AAF aircraft until February 1944, was removed to reduce weight and provide five extra knots of speed.|$|E

25|$|Airbus Industrie {{arrived at}} the show to promote their A300, {{claiming}} that the longer-ranged A-300B-4 variant would present strong competition in the U.S. domestic market due to operating costs being 5 to 7% lower than the L-1011 and DC-10 trijets. Noting that the original contract {{that led to the}} trivets had called for a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Ken Gordon of Airbus North America claimed that the original specification still needed to be filled. The third engine of the US designs gave them the ETOPS performance needed for trans-Atlantic flights, but were unneeded for flights within North America, which the 300 could meet with lower operational costs. Douglas and Lockheed responded by using the show to pitch two-engine versions of their three-engine designs to compete with the A300.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction {{was completed by}} student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400's leasing, resale and {{salvage value}} has dropped steeply {{because it is}} {{relatively}} expensive to operate. As many 747-400s {{are now more than}} 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have accelerated its retirement (as of 2015) and are replacing the model with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in many cases it has been replaced by wide-body <b>twin-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> of similar range such as the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets. Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas who plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s have ordered the Airbus A380 rather than the updated 747-8.|$|E
