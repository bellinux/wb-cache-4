5|$|During the Cold War the Warsaw Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out the beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a towel and called the Cardinals mascot, Big Red to the stage, where he used the towel <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> his armpits.

5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E

5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out the remains of Peter's existence. But {{at the last moment}} September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E
5|$|Finding Konrad's {{executed}} command team, Walker uses a small {{radio to}} communicate with who he believes to be Konrad himself, who challenges the morality of his actions throughout the story. Konrad then manipulates Walker into executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier, who both committed serious crimes. Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out the remaining population of Dubai to cover up the atrocities of the 33rd.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club.

By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out the northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E

5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael {{and demand}} that he perform a series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.
