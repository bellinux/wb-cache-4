40|$|ABSTRACT-Interruption of monsoon {{rainfall}} by prolonged spells of sparse rainfall (break-monsoon) {{during the}} midmonsoon months of July and August over <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of northern India (20 °- 29 'N, 75 O- 85 'E) has been investigated. When a tropical low-pressure system moves from <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> in a northerly direction toward the submontane {{region of the}} Himalaya, the monsoon trough of low pressure also moves from <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> to that region. This deprives <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of northern India of significant ascending motion and normal rainfall and brings about the breakmonsoon. During the break-monsoon period, descending motion takes place from the stratosphere to the lower troposphere over <b>the</b> <b>plains,</b> while ascending motion occurs in the regions {{to the north and}} south of <b>the</b> <b>plains.</b> As <b>the</b> descending motion persists over <b>the</b> <b>plains,</b> <b>the</b> breakmonsoon intensifies and the weather turns mainly dry. A vertical circulation model for the break-monsoon period is proposed. The break-monsoon ceases and normal monsoon conditions are re-established when the monsoon trough returns to <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> and intensifies. This occurs in wsociation with tropical low-pressure systems developing at or near the Bay of Bengal and moving toward <b>the</b> <b>plains.</b> <b>The</b> genesis and persistence of the break-monsoon, therefore, depends mainly on the interaction between the monsoon trough and tropical low-pressure systems of the Indian region...|$|R

5|$|The main {{conservation}} {{threat to}} <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. In the present day, this is mostly caused by Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery, which operates throughout its range. Although this species is discarded when caught, {{it is more}} delicate-bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear. Historically, this species {{may also have been}} negatively affected by Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern Australia from 1959 to 1990. These factors, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> maskray's limited distribution and low reproductive rate, have resulted in its being assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

For people living near the coasts or mountains of America, it must be hard to imagine longing for a 2 ̆ 2 home on <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> 2 ̆ 2 -but many Americans have had, and still have, a home on <b>the</b> <b>Plains.</b> <b>The</b> stereotypical American image of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> is flatness, austerity, emptiness.

How did this land come to be recognized as that of home? In Walter Prescott Webb 2 ̆ 7 s <b>The</b> Great <b>Plains</b> (1931), Webb argues that when <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> settlers had to adapt to their new environment, 2 ̆ 2 they were compelled to make a radical readjustment in their way of life. 2 ̆ 2 In p rticular, Webb focused on the 2 ̆ 2 treeless, flat, and semiaridity 2 ̆ 2 of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> and <b>the</b> key developments of railroads, barbed wire, windmills, and improved farm machinery and methods. 3 But another technology was key to the transformation of the Plains: photography.
