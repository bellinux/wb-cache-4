25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict additivity is the exception, rather than the rule, since most genes interact with hundreds or <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is {{significant}} variability in individual responses to opioid drugs, {{which is likely}} to have a significant genetic component. A number of non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions of the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM 1) have been postulated to contribute to this variability. Although many studies have investigated the clinical influences of these μ-opioid receptor variants, the outcomes are reported in the context of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes</b> and environmental factors, and we are no closer to being able to predict individual response to opioids based on genotype. Investigation of how μ-opioid receptor SNPs affect their expression, coupling to second messengers, desensitization and regulation is necessary to understand how subtle changes in receptor structure can impact individual responses to opioids. To date, the few functional studies that have investigated the consequences of SNPs on the signalling profile of the μ-opioid receptor in vitro have shown that the common N 40 D variant has altered functional responses to some opioids, while other, rarer, variants display altered signalling or agonist-dependent regulation. Here, we review the data available on the effects of μ-opioid receptor polymorphisms on receptor function, expression and regulation in vitro, and discuss the limitations of the studies to date. Whether or not μ-opioid receptor SNPs contribute to individual variability in opioid responses remains an open question, in large part because we have relatively little good data about how the amino acid changes affect μ-opioid receptor function. 15 page(s...|$|E

The hundreds or thousands of common cis-acting variations {{that occur in the}} population may in turn affect the expression of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes</b> by affecting transcription factors, signaling molecules, RNA processing, and other processes that act in trans. The levels of transcripts are conveniently quantitated using expression arrays, and the cis- and trans-acting loci can be mapped using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, {{in the same manner as}} loci for physiologic or clinical traits. Thousands of such expression QTL (eQTL) have been mapped in various crosses in mice, as well as other experimental organisms, and less detailed maps have been produced in studies of cells from human pedigrees. Such an integrative genetics approach (sometimes referred to as “genetical genomics”) is proving useful for identifying genes and pathways that contribute to complex clinical traits. The coincidence of clinical trait QTL and eQTL can help in the prioritization of positional candidate genes. More importantly, mathematical modeling of correlations between levels of transcripts and clinical traits in genetic crosses can allow prediction of causal interactions and the identification of “key driver” genes. An important objective of such studies will be to model biological networks in physiologic processes. When combined with high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping, it should be feasible to identify genes that contribute to transcript levels using association analysis in outbred populations. In this review we discuss the basic concepts and applications of this integrative genomic approach to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{cytochrome}} P 450 s (P 450 s) play critical {{roles in}} drug metabolism, toxicology, and metabolic processes. Despite rapid {{progress in the}} understanding of these enzymes, a systematic investigation of the full spectrum of functionality of individual P 450 s, the interrelationship or networks connecting them, and the genetic control of each gene/enzyme is lacking. To this end, we genotyped, expression-profiled, and measured P 450 activities of 466 human liver samples and applied a systems biology approach via the integration of genetics, gene expression, and enzyme activity measurements. We found that most P 450 s were positively correlated among themselves and were highly correlated with known regulators as well as <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes</b> enriched for pathways relevant to the metabolism of drugs, fatty acids, amino acids, and steroids. Genome-wide association analyses between genetic polymorphisms and P 450 expression or enzyme activities revealed sets of SNPs associated with P 450 traits, and suggested the existence of both cis-regulation of P 450 expression (especially for CYP 2 D 6) and more complex trans-regulation of P 450 activity. Several novel SNPs associated with CYP 2 D 6 expression and enzyme activity were validated in an independent human cohort. By constructing a weighted coexpression network and a Bayesian regulatory network, we defined the human liver transcriptional network structure, uncovered subnetworks representative of the P 450 regulatory system, and identified novel candidate regulatory genes, namely, EHHADH, SLC 10 A 1, and AKR 1 D 1. The P 450 subnetworks were then validated using gene signatures responsive to ligands of known P 450 regulators in mouse and rat. This systematic survey provides a comprehensive view of the functionality, genetic control, and interactions of P 450 s. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press...|$|E
