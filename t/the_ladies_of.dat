5|$|Melbourne's {{support in}} the House of Commons {{weakened}} through {{the early years of}} Victoria's reign, and in the 1841 general election the Whigs were defeated. Peel became prime minister, and <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> the bedchamber most associated with the Whigs were replaced.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> Hallifax {{launched}} {{a subscription to}} celebrate the crew of HMS Boston. On the other hand, the population of New York had a golden medal made in honour of the crew of Embuscade; Bompart accepted the medal on the condition {{he would not have}} to wear it, as the National Convention had banned medals.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{artifacts}} {{associated with}} Iberian culture are <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Guardamar −which has similar wheel-like rodetes and necklaces− or <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Baza. While <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Elche is a bust, {{there are indications}} that {{it was part of a}} seated statue, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Baza (with which it shares similar necklance pendants) or a standing one like the Gran Dama Oferente from Cerro de los Santos (Montealegre del Castillo, Albacete).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Mann was {{launched}} on 4 March 1930, by the Duchess <b>of</b> Atholl, <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Mann, after {{whom she was}} named.|$|R
5|$|In 1807 Scipione Piattoli {{returned}} to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married one of <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> the court. In his final years in Courland {{he was involved}} with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for which he never found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} the {{tradition}} of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> the Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The Fundación María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948. It was later renamed to, simply, the Eva Perón Foundation. Its funding began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.|$|E
5|$|It {{was invented}} {{in the context of}} the chivalrous pastimes of the court, by an Italian, and a Medici, the Queen Mother. Many poets, artists, musicians, choreographers, contributed to the result, but it was she who was the inventor, one might perhaps say, the producer; she who had <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> her court trained to perform these ballets in {{settings}} of her devising.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Camellias (Italian:La signora delle camelie) is a 1915 Italian {{historical}} drama film {{directed by}} Baldassarre Negroni and starring Hesperia, Alberto Collo, and Ida Carloni Talli. It is {{an adaptation of}} Alexandre Dumas, fils' novel <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Camellias. Another Italian version <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Camellias was released the same year.|$|R
50|$|The {{title is}} drawn from Tennyson's poem <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Shalott, in which while {{floating}} down to Camelot <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Shalott apparently dies of a broken heart, caused by the rejection of Sir Lancelot.|$|R
5|$|The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated. Hańska {{was bored}} by {{visits to the}} court at St. Petersburg, and even more bored by noble guests in her own home. She found {{nothing in common with}} <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> high society, and longed for the {{stimulating}} discussions she had enjoyed with her brother Henryk. She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, she {{published}} {{a collection of}} her short stories, <b>The</b> <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> Grace Adieu and Other Stories (2006). Both Clarke's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of 19th-century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. While Strange focuses {{on the relationship of}} two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> Grace Adieu and Other Stories, {{published}} in October 2006, {{is a collection}} of eight short stories by Susanna Clarke and illustrated by Charles Vess. The stories, which are sophisticated fairy tales, focus on the power of women and are set in the same alternate history as Clarke's debut novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (2004), in which magic has returned to England. The stories are written in a pastiche of 18th- and 19th-century styles and their tone is macabre as well as satirical. The volume was generally well received, though some critics compared it unfavorably to Jonathan Strange.|$|E

This poem has special significance for Ann and Pippa, who both see themselves as being trapped, as <b>the</b> <b>lady</b> was. Miss Moore states that <b>the</b> <b>lady</b> dies [...] "because she lets herself float through the world." [...] Stanzas five, six, eight, and fifteen <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> Shalott are also quoted, {{as a form of}} introduction, before Chapter One.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his death}} in 1883, the childless Tự Đức had named his nephew, Kiến Phúc, as his successor, rather than Dục Đức, his most senior heir. Tự Đức had written in his will that Dục Đức was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country. However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức under the {{pressure}} of <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> the court. Phan protested against the violation of Tự Đức's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions. Later, Dục Đức was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for Tự Đức and having affairs with the late emperor's consorts. Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as <b>The</b> <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E
