5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a <b>termination</b> <b>fee</b> equal to $78.5 million.|$|E

Accompanying Macmillan were the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Home; Thorneycroft; Sandys; and Zuckerman. Naval expertise was supplied by Vice Admiral Michael Le Fanu. Ormsby-Gore flew to Nassau with Kennedy. En route, he brokered a deal whereby Britain and the United States would continue development of Skybolt, with each paying half the cost, the American half being a kind of <b>termination</b> <b>fee.</b> In London, over one hundred Conservative members of Parliament, nearly one third of the parliamentary party, signed a motion urging Macmillan to ensure that Britain remained an independent nuclear power.|$|E
40|$|Institutional investors closely monitor <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> in {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} (M&A). We argue that their magnitude reflects either agency problems or efficiency considerations. Focusing on M&A involving Canadian targets between 1997 and 2004, we assess the determinants and market impact of <b>termination</b> <b>fees.</b> Our findings show that the Thomson's SDC Platinum [TM] "Worldwide Mergers""&""Acquisitions Database" underestimates their extent. Results suggest that <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> are essentially an efficient mechanism as they are relatively higher in M&A with high merger costs, a cash component and expected operating synergies. Stock market returns surrounding the deal announcement do not differ across levels of relative <b>termination</b> <b>fees.</b> Copyright 2007 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|We model takeovers as a {{bargaining}} process {{and explain the}} existence and net effect of target as well as bidder <b>termination</b> <b>fees,</b> subject to bargaining power and outside options. In equilibrium, net <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> (target minus acquirer fees) are offered by firms with a superior bargaining position {{in exchange for a}} greater share of merger synergies. This even holds when the target negotiates with the most efficient bidder {{and in the absence of}} bidding-related costs. Using a sample of 1232 U. S. mergers from 1986 to 2003, our theoretical predictions and the concept of net <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> find empirical support. Net <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> and premiums are positively correlated, while net fees decrease (increase) in targets' (acquirers') bargaining power, proxied by market capitalization, and increase (decrease) in targets' (acquirers') outside options, proxied inter alia by market-to-book ratios. These results question existing explanations for <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> and lockup options, like cost compensation, target commitment, agency costs and management entrenchment. They also imply that judicial ruling according to the more lenient business judgement is at least as justified as the application of more restrictive legal standards. mergers and acquisitions, bargaining power, outside option, <b>termination</b> <b>fees,</b> lockup options, stock option agreements...|$|R
40|$|Mobile phone networks' {{practice}} of charging {{higher prices for}} off-net than for on-net calls has been pinpointed {{as the source of}} two competition problems: underprovision of calls and permanent disadvantages for small networks. We consider these allegations and four different remedies: limiting on/off-net differentials or off-net margins, lower <b>termination</b> <b>fees,</b> and asymmetric <b>termination</b> <b>fees.</b> In all cases a trade-off has to be made between efficiency and networks' profits on the one hand, and consumer surplus on the other. Indeed, the total welfare effects of regulating on/off-net differentials are ambiguous and depend on demand characteristics.

25|$|On January 27, Meredith {{formally}} {{broke off}} the proposed merger with Media General {{and accepted the}} <b>termination</b> <b>fee</b> of $60 million previously negotiated under the original merger proposal; Media General subsequently signed an agreement to be acquired by Nexstar, in exchange for giving Meredith {{right of first refusal}} to acquire any broadcast or digital properties that may be divested (a clause that Meredith did not exercise). Because the FCC required Media General and Nexstar to divest stations in markets where both groups had television properties, the WISH-WNDY duopoly gained new sister stations in nearby markets within Indiana: the Evansville virtual duopoly of ABC affiliate WEHT and fellow CW affiliate WTVW, and the Terre Haute virtual duopoly of NBC affiliate WTWO and ABC affiliate WAWV-TV. CBS affiliate WANE-TV in Fort Wayne was the only existing sister station of WISH and WNDY that became part of the combined group, as Media General and Nexstar each sold certain Indiana stations they already owned (Nexstar's Fox affiliate WFFT-TV in Fort Wayne and Media General's two other Indiana-based CBS affiliates, WTHI-TV in Terre Haute and WLFI-TV in Lafayette) to Heartland Media to alleviate conflicts with FCC ownership rules. The transaction was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017; the sale was completed on January 17, at which point the existing Nexstar stations and the former Media General outlets that neither group had to sell in order to rectify ownership conflicts in certain markets became part of the renamed Nexstar Media Group.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million <b>termination</b> <b>fee</b> to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} model by Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998) treats <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> {{as an instrument}} to increase market power in a one-shot game of horizontal product differentiation. We offer an alternative view in an infinitely repeated Bertrand competition. We focus on symmetrical call-ing patterns and investigate simple two-part tariffs for two types, as well as general non-linear tariffs for two types and for a continuum of types. In this framework, <b>termination</b> <b>fees</b> make deviations from the collusive outcome less attractive. The optimum deviation strategy is usually to try to attract the high valuation customers since they exhibit the highest profits. Thus, a deviator will have a pool of high users which will have more outgoing than incoming calls, implying net termination payments. A cooperatively chosen termination rate can increase the deviator’s cost and thereby always stabilizes collusion. Two way access, mobile telecommunications, non-linear tariffs...|$|R
