Eight healthy adults maintained balance in stance during sinusoidal support surface translations (12 cm peak to peak) in the anterior-posterior direction at six different frequencies. Changes in kinematic and dynamic measures revealed that both sensory and biomechanical constraints limit postural coordination patterns {{as a function}} of <b>translation</b> <b>frequency.</b> At slow frequencies (0. 1 and 0. 25 Hz), subjects ride the platform (with the eyes open or closed). For fast frequencies (1. 0 and 1. 25 Hz) with the eyes open, subjects fix their head and upper trunk in space. With the eyes closed, large-amplitude, slow-sway motion of the head and trunk occurred for fast frequencies above 0. 5 Hz. Visual information stabilized posture by reducing the variability of the head's position in space and the position of the center of mass (CoM) within the support surface defined by the feet for all but the slowest translation frequencies. When subjects rode the platform, there was little oscillatory joint motion, with muscle activity limited mostly to the ankles. To support the head fixed in space and slow-sway postural patterns, subjects produced stable interjoint hip and ankle joint coordination patterns. This increase in joint motion of the lower body dissipated the energy input by fast translation frequencies and facilitated the control of upper body motion. CoM amplitude decreased with increasing <b>translation</b> <b>frequency,</b> whereas the center of pressure amplitude increased with increasing <b>translation</b> <b>frequency.</b> Our results suggest that visual information was important to maintaining a fixed position of the head and trunk in space, whereas proprioceptive information was sufficient to produce stable coordinative patterns between the support surface and legs.

50|$|Many {{communication}} satellites share a given frequency band. As a signal is transmitted {{to a particular}} satellite there is some amount of side lobe or spillover energy that is transmitted to adjacent satellites. At a receive station that has two antennas, one pointed at the primary satellite (the satellite the signal is intended for) and a secondary satellite (a satellite that is receiving side lobe energy), both paths of the signal are received and measured. From a comparison of those paths, two measurements can be made: Differential Time Offset (DTO) and Differential Frequency Offset (DFO). These measurements are often implemented through correlation processing. DTO represents the difference in time that it takes the signal to travel through the two satellites, while DFO represents the difference in frequency the received signals present through the two satellites. The frequency differences observed are due to different Doppler shift resulting from relative satellite motion and differences in the <b>translation</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the two satellite channels. Channel <b>translation</b> <b>frequencies</b> and downlink Doppler shift and delay can be calibrated out of the measurements by observing transmitters of known location simultaneously on the channels.

40|$|Fretting wear {{behaviour}} of electrodeposited Cu/Ni multilayer {{films with}} 10 and 5 nm thick sublayers {{has been investigated}} against a hardened steel ball as the counter body and {{compared with that of}} the constituents, Cu and Ni. The wear tests were carried out by using a ball-on-flat geometry at a <b>translation</b> <b>frequency</b> of 8 Hz and slip amplitude of 100 mum. Friction force was recorded on line during the tests. At the end of the tests, the wear scars were examined by laser surface profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. It has been observed that the frictional and wear mechanisms are very different for copper, nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers. Fretting of copper creates a relatively smooth wear scar mainly by mechanical ploughing of the asperities on steel counterbody (abrasive wear) and shows a very little third body interaction. Fretting of nickel involves adhesive wear resulting in a large transfer of steel to nickel, which is attributed to the strong chemical interaction between nickel and the steel counterbody. Fretting on multilayers involves a strong third body interaction resulting in ploughing mainly by debris (abrasive wear). The coefficient of friction is approximately 0. 45 for copper, and approximately 0. 8 for nickel as well as for multilayers. The values of the coefficient of friction for nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers found under the present fretting conditions are approximately double the corresponding values reported earlier for sliding wear conditions. It has been found that Cu/Ni multilayer is more resistance to fretting wear than the constituents, copper and nickel. Furthermore, the fretting wear resistance of Cu/Ni multilayers with 5 nm thick sublayer is better than that of the multilayers with 10 nm thick sublayers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{expression}} of lacZ has been analyzed and compared {{in a series}} of promoter cloning vectors by measuring the amount of lacZ mRNA by hybridization and the amount of β-galactosidase by standard enzymatic assay. Expression was driven by the promoter, Pspc, of the spc ribosomal protein operon. The vectors contained either the standard W 205 trp-lac fusion with the trp operon transcription terminator, trpt, located in the lacZ leader sequence, or a deletion derivative that functionally inactivates trpt. In the presence of trpt, lacZ expression was temperature dependent so that increasing the growth temperature reduced the accumulation of lacZ mRNA and β-galactosidase activity. The frequency of transcript termination at trpt was estimated to be near zero at 20 °C and at about 45 % at 37 °C. The amount of Pspc-derived lacZ mRNA and the amount of β-galactosidase produced per lacZ mRNA varied, depending on the mRNA 5 ′ leader sequence between Pspc and lacZ. These results demonstrate that the quantitative assessment of promoter activities with promoter cloning vectors requires careful analysis and interpretation. One particular construct without trpt did not seem to contain fortuitous transcription or translation signals generated at the fusion junction. In this strain, lacZ expression from Pspc was compared at the enzyme activity and mRNA levels with a previously constructed strain in which lacZ was linked to the tandem P 1 and P 2 promoters of the rrnB operon. At any given growth rate, the different activities of β-galactosidase in these two strains were found to reflect the same differences in their amounts of lacZ mRNA. Assuming that the promoter-lacZ fusions in these strains reflect the properties of the promoters in their normal chromosomal setting, it was possible to estimate the absolute transcription activity of Pspc and the relative translation efficiency of Pspc-lacZ mRNA at different growth rates. Transcription from the spc promoter was found to increase from about 10 transcripts per min at a growth rate of 1. 0 doublings/h to a maximum plateau of about 23 transcripts per min at growth rates above 1. 5 doublings/h. The <b>translation</b> <b>frequency</b> of lacZ mRNA expressed from Pspc was unaffected by growth rates...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} low-cost implementations for {{the next}} generation distributed antenna system (DAS) using analogue radio over fibre. A multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) enabled radio over fibre (RoF) system using double sideband (DSB) <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> system is proposed. In such a system, the 2 x 2 MIMO signals can be transmitted to the remote antenna units (RAUs) from the base station via a single optical link. By using the DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation,</b> the original single-input-single-output (SISO) DAS can be upgraded into the MIMO DAS without implementing parallel optical links. Experimentally, the DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> 2 x 2 MIMO RoF system transmits 2 x 2 LTE MIMO signals with 20 MHz bandwidth in each channel via a 300 m MMF link. The condition number of the system is < 10 dB within the power equaliser bandwidth which means the MIMO system is well-conditioned and the crosstalk between the channels can be compensated by the MIMO signal processing. To install the DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> system in a wideband service-agnostic DAS, the original MIMO signals need to be translated into unoccupied frequency bands over the DAS, which are usually occupied by specific applications that are not to be transmitted over the DAS. The frequency spectrum allocation of the wireless services is analysed showing that by choosing a particular LO frequency (2. 2 GHz in the UK), in the DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> system, the original MIMO signals can always be translated into unoccupied frequency bands so that the same infrastructure can support multiple services. The idea of DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> system can not only support MIMO radio over fibre but can also improve the SFDR of a general radio over fibre system. Because when the upper sideband and the lower sideband of the signal after translation are converted back to the original frequency band, the noise adds incoherently but the signals add-up coherently, this gives the system theoretically 2 dB 3 rd order SFDR improvement. If the idea of the DSB <b>frequency</b> <b>translation</b> is extended into a higher number of sidebands, the system SFDR can be further improved. Experimentally, the system 3 rd order SFDR can be improved beyond the intrinsic optical link by 2. 7 dB by using quadruple sideband (QSB) <b>frequency</b> <b>translation.</b> It means the optical bandwidth in a general RoF system can be traded for the electrical SFDR. By integrating the analogue and the digital RoF systems, a hybrid DAS has been demonstrated, showing that the EVM dynamic range for the 4 G LTE service (using digital RoF link) can be improved to be similar to the 3 G UMTS service (using analogue RoF link), so that fewer number of RAUs for the LTE services are needed...|$|R
