40|$|<b>Tracer</b> <b>methods</b> are {{commonly}} used for estimation of soil water and groundwater recharge flux especially in arid and semiarid regions. These <b>tracer</b> <b>methods</b> {{are based on the}} solute profile shape (distribution of concentration with depth) and peak position. For soils of semi-arid to sub-humid climates, vertical water movement may seasonally vary in direction due to climate conditions and vegetative demands. The first objective of this thesis was to show that TDR (time domain reflectometry) can be a useful tool for estimation of soil water fluxes using <b>tracer</b> <b>methods.</b> The second objective was to study the effects of repeated cycles of directionally-varying flow upon solute profile shape and position used by <b>tracer</b> <b>methods</b> under controlled laboratory conditions. Three soil columns with a KCl tracer and Beaver Creek sand were used for this study. Rain and evaporative systems were used to cause the downward and upward soil water movements in the column, respectively. Soil moisture content and solute concentration were measured using TDR. The result for the first objective was that the peak migration and the soil water balance methods gave similar average upward and downward soil water fluxes. This result indicates that the TDR method can be recommended for determination of soil water fluxes with <b>tracer</b> <b>methods</b> in fields or in laboratory studies for sufficient time and depth. In the second objective, three different seasonal flow regimes were studied using the sand columns, and each flow regime simulated climatic seasons that might occur in the field. Several apparent and statistical parameters were used to evaluate the change of the solute profile shape and position under cycling conditions of the three different flow regimes. These parameters showed that the solute profile shape and position clearly changed under the three different repeated regimes of downward and upward seasonal flows. It was concluded that climate (seasonality) can have significant impacts on the estimation of soil water fluxes using <b>tracer</b> <b>methods.</b> The result from this investigation shows that the profile shape and position after a number of cycles (years of fluctuations) can provide a description of the previous climatic effects on the concentration profile. Therefore, the profile shape can be used as an indicator of the flow regime that has affected the solute profile shape. Moreover, if a reference of a solute profile is available (a solute profile before a period of time), it is easier to determine the flow regime affected the profile shape and position by determining the change of the profile shape and position using statistical parameters presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{increasing}} {{recognition of}} tillage erosion processes {{has shown that}} soil redistribution by tillage directly contributes to soil loss in mechanically and nonmechanically agricultural areas worldwide. Soil translocation by tillage is normally measured by means of tracers, with which a volume of soil is labelled, and therefore yielding tillage erosion rates in a field. Two tracer methods for estimating tillage erosion rates were appraised to examine the application adaption to local conditions in the hilly areas, southwestern China, {{in terms of the}} accuracy, measurement sensitivity, manipulation facility, and time cost. The two tracer methods had a similar measurement accuracy of soil translocation. However, for the magnetic <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> the result of tracer distribution after tillage was immediately obtained in the field, while there was a need to do a follow-up indoor determination for the stone chip method. The magnetic <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> only required collecting a small volume of soil samples, while a large quantity of soil (i. e. all the soils into which tracers possibly redistributed) was collected to recover all the stone chips from tilled soils. As a result, the magnetic <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> would be much time saving compared to the stone chip method. It is suggested that the magnetic <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> would rather be used when there are large quantities of sampling plots to be measured on steep hillslopes of the hilly areas where hoeing tillage is practiced...|$|E

The theta im values estimated by the basic single <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> were consistently lower than the multiple <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> values. This was attributed to the assumption that alpha = 0 for the basic single <b>tracer</b> <b>method.</b> Furthermore, alpha values estimated by multiple <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> were more realistic and easier to obtain than the variance single tracer method;A novel miscible-displacement system with on-line high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) was developed to study the fate and transport of volatile organic compounds. This system was capable of simultaneous detection of multiple compounds at low concentrations. This system was automated and could operate for long time periods (several days to weeks) with minimal flow rate fluctuations and stable chemical detections;Lastly, zero-valent metals were used to reduce chlorinated solvents in contaminated groundwater by flowing it through zero-valent metals. Previous zero-valent metal research included batch or resident concentration column experiments to study degradation processes and to design remediation systems; however, difficulties were associated with these methods such as determination of sorbed concentrations and estimation of effluent concentrations from resident concentrations. In this study miscible-displacement experiments were used {{as an alternative to}} study trichloroethylene (TCE) fate and transport through zero-valent metals. Dissolved TCE was passed through columns filled with sand, iron, or copper-platted iron filings (Cu-Fe) at three velocities and effluent breakthrough curves were determined with an on-line HPLC. There was no detectable TCE degradation in the sand column experiments. More TCE was reduced in the presence of Cu-Fe than iron. The reduction of TCE produced ethylene which resulted in simultaneous breakthrough curves of these compounds. These simultaneous breakthrough curves were described with a two-site partial nonequilibrium sorption model with degradation and production.

Trend evaluation of water content data is the least precise method because it cannot be used alone to assess the percolation rate. The precision of percolation rates estimated using <b>tracer</b> <b>methods</b> depends on the tracer concentration, percolation rate, and the sensitivity of the chemical extraction and analysis methods. Percolation rates determined using the water balance method have a precision of approximately 100 mm/yr in humid climates and 50 mm/yr in semiarid and drier climates, which is too large to demonstrate that an AEFC is meeting typical equivalency criterion (30 mm/yr or less). In most cases, the precision will be much poorer.

This method is based on simultaneous feeding of unlabeled glucose and trace amounts of [U- 13 C]gluconate, followed by measurement of the mass isotopomers of the intracellular metabolites surrounding the 6 -phosphogluconate node. The gluconate <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> was used with a penicillin G-producing chemostat culture of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. For comparison, a 13 C-labeling-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was performed for glycolysis and the PPP of P. chrysogenum. For the first time mass isotopomer measurements of 13 C-labeled primary metabolites are reported for P. chrysogenum and used for a 13 C-based MFA. Estimation of the PPP split ratio of P. chrysogenum at a growth rate of 0. 02 h 1 yielded comparable values for the gluconate <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> and the 13 C-based MFA method, 51. 8 % and 51. 1 %, respectively. A sensitivity analysis of the estimated PPP split ratios showed that the 95 % confidence interval was almost threefold smaller for the gluconate <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> than for the 13 C-based MFA method (40. 0 to 63. 5 % and 46. 0 to 56. 5 %, respectively).

These methods {{are applied to}} a {{waste water treatment plant}} (WWTP) located in Valence, France. We show that Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements as well as Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) can be used to measure emissions from the process to the regional scale. To estimate the total emissions, we investigate a tracer release method (using C 2 H 2) and the Radon <b>tracer</b> <b>method</b> (using 222 Rn). For process-scale emissions, both tracer release and chamber techniques were used.
