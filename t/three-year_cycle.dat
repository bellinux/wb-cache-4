5|$|Mainly {{active at}} night, the sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans, bony fishes, and cephalopods. It has been {{observed}} gathering in groups in shallow water during summertime, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk. Females give birth to 6–12 pups between late May and August, on a two- or <b>three-year</b> <b>cycle.</b> The sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers, and some are also captured on commercial bottom longlines. Because of its small range, its low growth and reproductive rates, it is very vulnerable to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore listed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
