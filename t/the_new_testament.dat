5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure.

They believe that <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are largely based on the text of the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E

5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek New Testament, as well as the Septuagint.

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the first}} {{manuscript}} of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} codex was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best manuscript of New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E
