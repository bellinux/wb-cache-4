5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E

Rather than challenging particular laws, they frame <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> being in keeping with Chinese laws, and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses. As such, Weiquan lawyering {{has been described as a}} form of Rightful resistance.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> <b>As</b> {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the gold rush on the Native peoples of the region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} from <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E
5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging from <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
5|$|When Henson {{began work}} on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a {{financial}} success, but after graduating from college, Henson began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers, who looked on <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> an art form. Upon Henson's return to the United States, he and Jane began dating. They were married in 1959 and had five children, Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).|$|E

5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> <b>as</b> well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E
5|$|From mid 2006, Takahashi {{was working}} on a {{separate}} project; struck by an idea of rival civilizations emerging on the frozen bodies of two warring gods, he and Honne constructed a model of the two gods to better visualize the idea. After bringing their idea to Nintendo producer Satoshi Yamagami, the team began development in 2007. Takahashi later stated that the game's development acted as a means of boosting company morale after the failure of the Xenosaga series. The director, Koh Kojima, started his directorial debut with this game, he had previously written the scenario for Baten Kaitos Origins. This game also saw a shift away from the narrative-heavy approach of Monolith Soft's earlier work, which Takahashi stated had been called out as old-fashioned. In contrast to many earlier Monolith Soft projects, the game was designed with an international release in mind. The intended scale of the game caused problems, and Takahashi reluctantly went to Yamagami with a list of proposals to cut down the game to a suitable size as he was accustomed to doing this from previous projects. Yamagami rejected all of Takahashi's suggestions, and instead, persuaded Nintendo to keep supporting the project allowing Takahashi {{and the rest of the}} team to complete <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> envisioned. Originally titled Monado: Beginning of the World, Iwata had the title changed to honor Takahashi's previous work on Xenogears and the Xenosaga franchise. The new title was Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Music for Industrial People was {{originally}} coined by Monte Cazazza as the strapline {{for the record}} label Industrial Records, founded by British art-provocateurs Throbbing Gristle. The first wave of this music appeared with Throbbing Gristle, from London; Cabaret Voltaire, from Sheffield; and Boyd Rice (recording under the name NON), from the United States. Throbbing Gristle first performed in 1976, and began as the musical offshoot of the Kingston upon Hull-based COUM Transmissions. COUM was initially a psychedelic rock group, but began to describe <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> performance art {{in order to obtain}} grants from the Arts Council of Great Britain. COUM was composed of P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. Beginning in 1972, COUM staged several performances inspired by Fluxus and Viennese Actionism. These included various acts of sexual and physical abjection. Peter Christopherson, an employee of commercial artists Hipgnosis, joined the group in 1974, with Carter joining the following year.|$|E

5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|That year Clements and Musker {{expanded}} the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating {{the role of}} the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with Oliver out of the way, Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{simulating}} Lange's {{fall into}} the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura {{said that it was}} the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several times because the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside the dummy wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were the most crucial element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura said is extremely rare because the crew members typically look at <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.|$|E

5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
