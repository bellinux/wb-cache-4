5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E
5|$|The symbol {{used by the}} French rugby {{team was}} a great success, and was later adopted by the French {{delegation}} at the Olympic Games of 1920 where <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> was perched on five Olympic rings. <b>The</b> <b>rooster</b> has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called les coqs and some French supporters {{have been known to}} release roosters on the playing field before games.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R. The series was {{produced}} primarily by using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from video games to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio.

50|$|The {{rivalry between}} these two sides arise from <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> {{recruiting}} Brad Fittler and Phil Gould from the Panthers {{in an attempt to}} turn the Roosters' fortunes around after almost a decade out of the finals. The pair had both won a premiership with the Panthers in 1991 and were looking to do the same at <b>the</b> <b>Roosters.</b> In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> failed to make the Grand Final with both Fittler (who was appointed captain during his arrival at <b>the</b> <b>Roosters)</b> and Gould, only for <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> to get there the year after Gould quit coaching <b>the</b> <b>Roosters.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to {{identify}} him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus.

After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed <b>the</b> <b>rooster,</b> and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{claiming}} the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to make}} the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to {{claiming the}} premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, <b>the</b> <b>rooster.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, <b>the</b> <b>rooster</b> was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
50|$|The opening minutes {{were spent}} with both teams trading blows, <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> mainly with <b>the</b> upper hand. However it took till the 23rd minute for the {{deadlock}} to be broken, <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> scoring through Shannon Hegarty. Craig Fitzgibbon converted the try and <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Roosters</b> led 6-0. Soon, the Warriors found their rhythm and Ivan Cleary got a penalty goal {{to make the}} score 6-2 to <b>the</b> <b>Roosters.</b> It remained that way to half time, <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Roosters</b> holding <b>the</b> upper hand over the New Zealand Warriors.|$|R
50|$|On 18 July 2009, {{following}} an ongoing season of unrelenting disappointment at <b>the</b> <b>Roosters,</b> <b>the</b> media {{was informed that}} in 2010 Brad Fittler would {{not be part of}} the coaching staff at <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Roosters,</b> reportedly before he was. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>Roosters</b> took out <b>the</b> 2009 wooden spoon and a clean-out of the club began.

5|$|Timber the Tiger's parents go {{on holiday}} and leave their son {{in charge of}} the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to {{organize}} a race. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the island's four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercrafts, and aeroplanes. Drumstick <b>the</b> <b>Rooster,</b> the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially <b>the</b> <b>rooster,</b> for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
