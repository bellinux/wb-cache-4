5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> complex is a water well.|$|E
5|$|Except {{for a few}} {{visits to}} other monasteries, his life was spent in a round of prayer, {{observance}} of <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> discipline and study of the Sacred Scriptures. He was considered the most learned man of his time, and wrote excellent biblical and historical books.|$|E

5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning.

5|$|Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full {{expulsion}} of a monk from sangha follows instances of killing, {{just like any}} other serious offense against <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> nikaya code of conduct.|$|E
50|$|In Burmese Buddhism, Dharma names (bwe) are in Pali and {{chosen by}} the head monk of the monastery in which one is ordained. The {{traditional}} Burmese naming system, in which <b>the</b> <b>monastic's</b> day of birth stipulates the first letter of one's name, is used to select the name.|$|R

5|$|Both {{types of}} Bede's {{theological}} works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A {{number of his}} biblical commentaries were incorporated into the Glossa Ordinaria, an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon, and they were used in that form in <b>the</b> <b>Monastic</b> Office. Saint Boniface used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{with regard}} to the location of the hospital being abutted to the church comes from several other medieval hospitals. In England, <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> infirmary at Christ Church Canterbury; the infirmary at St Mary Chichester; St Bartholomew, Chatam and St James Dulwich are built with an infirmary abutting the respective chapels. The infirmary hall of St Mary Magdalene at Glastonbury also follows this structure.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> {{traditions of}} both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves {{the repetition of}} the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> buildings. Reconstruction began {{almost immediately}} and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of {{the walls of the}} aisle and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.|$|E
5|$|In 985, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury {{to come to}} Ramsey to help found <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> school there.

5|$|John Doukas is {{no longer}} {{mentioned}} in the Alexiad after his 1097 campaign. It is, however, known from monastic documents {{that at some point}} he retired to a monastery and assumed <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> name Antony.

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. This wave was {{responsible}} for the foundation of the majority of England's monasteries, and very few were founded after the 13th century. These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for prayers for their soul, and often, the right to be buried within <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company of young women in his dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.|$|E

5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata. Much of what is known of these times is the product of <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> sites such as Iona, Lismore, Eigg and Tiree but north of Dál Riata, where the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, the historical record is sparse.|$|E
5|$|The strictest {{forms of}} Jain diet are practised by <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> ascetics. It also {{excludes}} potatoes and other root vegetables.

5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with <b>the</b> <b>monastic</b> historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
