5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, dubnium should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in the periodic table.|$|E

However, from Fig.  3, when using the method of this paper to make predictions on wind farm 1, the figure shows only a small upward and protruding rectangle, whereas Fig.  3 b and c has more than three, indicating that the method in this paper fully uses the correlation between wind power sequences and has a better prediction effect.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{effectiveness}} of behavioral evaluation measures for predicting drivers’ subjective drowsiness. Behavioral measures included neck vending angle (horizontal and vertical), back pressure, foot pressure, COP (Center of Pressure) movement on sitting surface, and tracking error in driving simulator task. Drowsy states were predicted by means of the multinomial logistic regression model where physiological and behavioral measures and subjective evaluation of drowsiness corresponded to independent variables and a dependent variable, respectively. First, we compared the effectiveness of two methods (correlation coefficient-based method and odds ratio-based method) for determining the order of entering behavioral measures into <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> model. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy did not differ between both methods. Second, <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy was compared among the numbers of behavioral measures. <b>The</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy did not differ among four, five, and six behavioral measures, and it was concluded that entering at least four behavioral measures into <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> model is enough to achieve higher <b>prediction</b> accuracy. Third, <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy was compared between the strongly drowsy and the weakly drowsy group. <b>The</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy differed between the two groups, and the proposed method was effective (<b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy was significantly higher) especially under the condition where drowsiness was induced to a larger extent...|$|R
