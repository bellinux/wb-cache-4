5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: in addition <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain {{a high concentration of}} ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E

In 2008, he won his twelfth cap, breaking the record for the most international caps received by a Gillingham player. Crofts was selected for the Welsh national under-19 team in 2002, qualifying due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> Welsh grandparent. He made his first appearance for the team in the Milk Cup tournament in Northern Ireland, but was forced to return home after suffering an ankle injury in the Welsh team's first match.

He admitted <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> good working relationship with Clough while he {{was a part of the}} England youth side.

5|$|Iraq {{achieved}} {{their second}} Gulf Cup of Nations in the 1984 edition in Muscat, with Ammo Baba as the team's manager. Saeed scored the two Iraqi goals in Iraq's first match in a 2–1 victory, scored a hat-trick in Iraq's 4–0 win over Saudi Arabia, and also scored two goals in Iraq's fifth match against Kuwait in a 3–1 win. Iraq were a match away from winning the cup but, unfortunately, Iraq lost against Qatar in a 1–2 defeat. Iraq and Qatar had {{an equal amount}} of points which led them <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> final decisive match. On 28 March, a final match between them was played. The two teams drew in the whole 90 minutes of the game. In extra time, Iraq scored a goal and Qatar leveled, taking the match to penalties where Iraq defeated Qatar 4–3. Saeed was the top goalscorer of the tournament with 7 goals and had received the Best Player of the Tournament award along with Oman's Ghulam Khamis.|$|E
5|$|Sisler {{returned}} to the Tigers for the 1960season, and manager Dykes noted {{that he was not}} confident that his bullpen could help when needed, pointing to the previous season as a reference. The Tigers bullpen had won just nine games in 1959, but began 1960 with three straight victories, with Sisler pitching a scoreless two-inning appearance on April22. His performance was considered a surprise, due <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> poor spring training. Although he pitched well in his first game of the season, he quickly lost his form, and by May18, his ERA had risen to 5.06 and had a 1–2record. It was {{at this point in the}} season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness, and by August12 he had lowered his ERA to 1.90. His season totals included a 2.47ERA and a 7-5win-loss record, both career bests, and added six saves in 80innings pitched.|$|E

A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E

On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E
5|$|During Persson's time as {{chairman}} Malmö FF employed their first foreign managers and won their first national titles. In total Persson employed 15 managers, seven {{of whom were}} foreign born. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan and became Swedish champions {{for the first time}} in 1944, and by the end of the 1970s had won nine Swedish league championships. Most of the titles won during this time were under foreign managers, the most successful of whom in terms of honours was Bob Houghton, whom Persson appointed in 1974. Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 was younger than several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won their respect and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name. There was also some initial disagreement between Persson and Houghton as Persson had been used <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> final say in the team selection. Houghton wanted full purview over team selection, and Persson ultimately relented and gave it to him.|$|E
