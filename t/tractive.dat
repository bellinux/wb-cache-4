5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. They considered high powered and high <b>tractive</b> steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tractive</b> {{effort is}} a measure of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, <b>tractive</b> effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used dynamometer cars to measure <b>tractive</b> force at speed in actual road testing.|$|E
25|$|British railway {{companies}} {{have been reluctant to}} disclose figures for drawbar horsepower and have usually relied on continuous <b>tractive</b> effort instead.|$|E
25|$|With their {{comparatively}} high <b>tractive</b> effort (the Walschaerts A2 had {{a higher}} nominal <b>tractive</b> effort than any other VR locomotive, regardless of type, until {{the introduction of the}} C class 2-8-0 of 1918) they also saw widespread use as a fast goods locomotive, particularly in their later life. It was reported as normal practice as early as the 1920s for A2 class locomotives requiring adjustment to axle boxes (axleboxes) and other moving parts to be swapped from passenger to lower-speed freight service to extract greater work from them between overhauls.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop <b>tractive</b> effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or <b>tractive</b> force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|No.42 {{was well}} suited for dock shunting. A {{relatively}} high <b>tractive</b> effort for a four coupled engine of 1874 vintage was packed into a total wheelbase of , ideal for the tight dockyard curves.|$|E
25|$|Campbell's {{solution}} to the problem of weight distribution and <b>tractive</b> effort was to develop two coupled drivers, one in front of the boiler and one at the rear with a two axle lead truck.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was <b>tractive</b> force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting <b>tractive</b> effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E
25|$|During the 1880s, their boiler {{pressure}} was increased from 130 to 140 psi, and their cylinder bore increased from 16 to 17 inches, with those rebuilt after 1896 being fitted with 17.5 inch cylinders. These changes led to considerably increased <b>tractive</b> effort.|$|E
25|$|The 5700s {{were given}} the GWR route colour Blue (based on axle load), and were in the GWR power group C (based on <b>tractive</b> effort). The classifications were shown on the cab with the letter C in a blue disc.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{locomotive}} has accelerated the driver can adjust the reverser toward the mid-gear position, decreasing cut-off {{to give a}} more economical use of steam. The engine's <b>tractive</b> effort is then less than it was at starting, but its power is greater.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the new American Type steam {{locomotive}} deliver more horsepower, <b>tractive</b> effort, and reliability it also {{laid the groundwork for}} locomotive engineering in the 19th century with boilers mounted horizontally (instead of vertically), smoke stacks mounted vertically at the front to expel the smoke and cinders away from the crew and passengers.|$|E
25|$|The AA {{class was}} {{gradually}} made redundant by {{the delivery of}} large numbers of 4-6-0 locomotives of the new Dd and A2 classes between 1902 and 1922, which eventually totalled 446 locomotives. The A2 offered considerably more power, while the Dd offered similar <b>tractive</b> effort to the AA but much greater route availability due to its lower axle load.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{loadings}} and the ageing of {{the original}} locomotive fleet led to {{the purchase of a}} powerful six wheel side tank engine with the extraordinary <b>tractive</b> effort of 22,403lb. It became WCC no 16 and was delivered from Andrew Barclay in July 1934. Two similar engines, nos 17 and 18 followed in 1935 and 1938, and nos 19 and 20 followed in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Although the J class {{produced}} the same nominal <b>tractive</b> effort as the K or N class, {{they had a}} slightly higher adhesive weight (and as such a better factor of adhesion) and were permitted to haul heavier loads on gradients. They {{could be found in}} goods service on branch lines across the state, but were also found on mainlines running roadside goods services.|$|E
25|$|In this design, {{the tank}} is placed behind the cab, usually over a {{supporting}} bogie. This removes {{the weight of}} the water from the driving wheels, giving the locomotive a constant <b>tractive</b> weight. The disadvantage is a reduction in water carrying capacity. A rear tank is an essential component of the American Forney type of loco, which is essentially a 4-4-0 American-type with wheels reversed.|$|E
25|$|The single FF1 {{appeared}} in 1917 and ran experimentally {{for a number}} of years in preparation for electrification over the Allegheny Mountains that never came to fruition. Its AC induction motors and side-rod drive powered six axles. It developed a starting <b>tractive</b> force of 140,000 pounds, which was capable of ripping couplers out of the fragile wooden freight cars in use at the time.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{different}} pantographs, electrical systems for DC operation, the F140MS types are identical to the contemporary dual voltage versions. However, under 1.5kV DC, the maximum available power is limited to 4.0MW, although this {{does not affect the}} maximum <b>tractive</b> effort, which is limited by other factors. As a consequence of the additional equipment required, the locomotives weigh approximately 1 tonne more than their dual voltage relatives.|$|E
25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high <b>tractive</b> effort and limited adhesive weight (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|E
25|$|Nos 5 & 6 were to {{be called}} Man of Kent and Maid of Kent, but due to their high <b>tractive</b> effort (having smaller coupled wheels than the Pacifics) the names Hercules and Samson, with their allusion of strength, were {{substituted}} during construction. A decade later, Henry Greenly, the designer, {{was involved in the}} construction of a locomotive on the nearby Saltwood Miniature Railway, and this engine took the Maid of Kent name.|$|E
25|$|A tractor is a {{distinctive}} farm vehicle {{specifically designed to}} deliver a high <b>tractive</b> effort at slow speeds, {{for the purposes of}} hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. While steam powered tractors had been built earlier, In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|The diesel {{version of}} the TRAXX {{platform}} was introduced with the 2E {{version of the}} TRAXX platform. In the diesel version, the fuel tank occupies the same space as the transformer in the electric versions, centrally and below the main frame members. Installed motor power is 2.2MW. The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and control desk, body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum <b>tractive</b> effort is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|The high <b>tractive</b> {{effort of}} the C class {{locomotives}} enabled Victorian Railways to operate heavier goods trains with a single locomotive and thus enabled significant savings in operating costs through a reduction in train-miles for the tonnage hauled. Along with the smaller K class branch line 2-8-0, they were credited with playing a major part in the 15% reduction in overall goods and livestock train miles on Victoria Railways between 1920 and 1924, against a reduction of overall tonnage hauled of only 3% for the same years.|$|E
25|$|They {{were used}} to start a heavy train or {{maintain}} low speed under demanding conditions. It could be cut in while moving at speeds under 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h). Rated at about 300hp (224kW) at speeds of from 10 to 30 miles per hour (16 to 48km/h). It would automatically cut out from between 20 and 35mph (32 to 56km/h), depending on the model and design. <b>Tractive</b> effort of 10-12,000lbf (44 to 53kN) was common, although ratings of up to around 15,000lbf (66kN) were possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Allis-Chalmers {{collaborated with}} Firestone to {{introduce}} pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved <b>tractive</b> force and fuel {{economy in the}} range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} in 1949 of thirty-five Pm and Pmr {{class was}} {{originally intended to}} oust the Pr locomotives from express services the later designs proved unstable at speed and were transferred instead to fast goods workings, leaving the Pr class as the only express locomotive on the WAGR. The introduction of X class diesels in 1954, however, ended their long tenure in this position and both P and Pr class locomotives were gradually relegated to goods and shunting duties. Their adequate <b>tractive</b> effort and economy, however, ensured their survival {{until the very end}} of steam.|$|E
25|$|Train crews favored #2450 {{due to the}} {{superior}} riding qualities of its Blomberg trucks, which ran more smoothly than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks; being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher <b>tractive</b> effort, which was helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 {{as part of a}} general locomotive renumbering scheme. It was again renumbered along with the Santa Fe's few remaining EMD switchers and assigned #1460 in January, 1977.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} {{have less}} power compared to electric locomotives {{for the same}} weight and dimensions. For instance, the 2,200kW of a modern British Rail Class 66 was matched in 1927 by the electric SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/7 (2,300kW), which is lighter. However, for low speeds, <b>tractive</b> effort {{is more important than}} power. This is why diesel engines are competitive for slow freight traffic (as it is common in the U.S.) but not for passenger or mixed passenger/freight traffic like on many European railway lines, especially where heavy freight trains must be run at comparatively high speeds (80km/h or more).|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised <b>tractive</b> effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in <b>tractive</b> force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays {{passenger}} trains are mostly pulled by Re 4/4 II (up to two for long trains) and sometimes by Re 460, freight trains by Re 6/6 and Re 4/4 III. Up to 1300 tons may be pulled by an Re 6/6 with an Re 4/4 III This combination {{is sometimes called}} a Re 10/10. If the trains are heavier, then any additional locomotives must be used as banking locomotives {{at the rear of}} the train, because the <b>tractive</b> effort of more power at the front of the train would exceed the capacity of the couplers within the train.|$|E
25|$|Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab {{locomotives}} {{proved the}} superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an articulated locomotive with greater <b>tractive</b> effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy goods locomotive, the most powerful locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, {{the range of the}} E class locomotives was similarly extended and they could be found shunting or hauling services along the line.|$|E
25|$|With the {{issuance}} of his patent in 1836, Campbell worked with James Brooks to build the first 4-4-0 using his idea. Although it proved to develop 60 percent more <b>tractive</b> effort than the Standard Baldwin 4-2-0, it was not widely adopted. This was {{largely because of the}} rigid frame which did not allow for maintaining equal weight on the drivers and it was prone to derail. This problem was solved by Joseph Harrison, Jr., partner in the American steam locomotive manufacturing firm of Eastwick and Harrison with the development of the equalising beam. Campbell tried to sue Eastwick for patent infringement With no success.|$|E
25|$|The 0-6-0 {{configuration}} was {{the most}} widely used wheel arrangement for both tender and tank steam locomotives. The type was also widely used for diesel switchers (shunters). Because they lack leading and trailing wheels, locomotives of this type have all their weight pressing down on their driving wheels and consequently have a high <b>tractive</b> effort and factor of adhesion, making them comparatively strong engines for their size, weight and fuel consumption. On the other hand, the lack of unpowered leading wheels have the result that 0-6-0 locomotives are less stable at speed. They are therefore mostly used on trains where high speed is unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{trains are}} pulled using a locomotive. This {{involves}} {{one or more}} powered vehicles being located {{at the front of}} the train, providing sufficient <b>tractive</b> force to haul the weight of the full train. This arrangement remains dominant for freight trains and is often used for passenger trains. A push-pull train has the end passenger car equipped with a driver's cab so that the engine driver can remotely control the locomotive. This allows one of the locomotive-hauled train's drawbacks to be removed, since the locomotive need not be moved to the front of the train each time the train changes direction. A railroad car is a vehicle used for the haulage of either passengers or freight.|$|E
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. <b>Tractive</b> effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|E
