5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as <b>tinea</b> versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and <b>Tinea</b> pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of <b>tinea</b> corporis (ringworm), <b>tinea</b> cruris (jock itch) and <b>tinea</b> pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of <b>tinea</b> infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E

25|$|Athlete's foot, known {{medically}} as <b>tinea</b> pedis, is {{a common}} skin infection of the feet caused by fungus. Signs and symptoms often include itching, scaling, and redness. In severe cases the skin may blister. Athlete's foot fungus may infect {{any part of the}} foot, but most often grows between the toes. The next most common area is the bottom of the foot. The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands. It {{is a member of the}} group of diseases known as <b>tinea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Keratinophilic fungal {{species that}} {{fall under the}} genus Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, or Microsporum, are {{pathogenic}} to humans and other animals, and {{are referred to as}} dermatophytes {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause dermatophytosis in these hosts. However, infections in these hosts caused by soil-derived keratinophilic saprotrophs like A.fulvescens are very seldom and only a few cases have been documented in the literature. The first documented case of A.fulvescens causing <b>tinea</b> corporis was in 1970 when the fungus was repeatedly isolated from a 4 x 5cm red patch on the inner right thigh of a 21-year-old white male. This case showcases the clinical importance of non-dermatophyte keratinophilic fungi such as A.fulvescens as a result of the ability to cause dermatophytosis in the form of <b>tinea</b> corporis in humans. While visually, the case of <b>tinea</b> corporis was indistinguishable from those caused by true dermatophytes, the infection did not respond well to typical treatment. This observation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment of the skin lesion and highlights the necessity of awareness for atypical opportunistic human pathogenic fungi.|$|E
25|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as <b>Tinea</b> capitis, doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|E
25|$|Topically {{administered}} ketoconazole {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and <b>tinea</b> versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|Germs, bacteria, {{and mold}} can grow very quickly on wet bathing suits.

500|$|Scrub typhus {{was spread}} by mites {{that lived in}} the soil. Soldiers walking through mite-infested areas were fairly safe, but if they sat or lay down or stood still for long enough, the mites could attach themselves. Although the {{incidence}} of typhus was much {{less than that of}} malaria or dysentery, it was more lethal. Of 2,839 Australian servicemen affected in SWPA, 9.05% died. Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. <b>Tinea</b> was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to wash them. A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin-deficiency-related problems. To save weight and simplify the distribution [...] of rations, the 7th Division staff cut back the number of commodities in the ration from thirteen (bully beef, biscuits, tea, sugar, salt, dried fruit, jam, butter, milk, cheese, tinned fruit, tinned vegetables and bacon) to just the first six.

2500|$|Athlete's foot {{is divided}} into four {{categories}} or presentations: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka [...] "moccasin foot"), acute ulcerative <b>tinea</b> pedis, and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. [...] "Interdigital" [...] means between the toes. [...] "Plantar" [...] here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. [...] A vesiculobullous disease {{is a type of}} mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5–10mm and bulla being larger than 5–10mm, depending upon what definition is used).|$|E

The mites are distributed around the world and equally infect all ages, races, and socioeconomic classes in different climates. Scabies is more often seen in crowded areas with unhygienic living conditions. Globally as of 2009, an estimated 300million cases of scabies occur each year, although various parties claim the figure is either over- or underestimated.

6000|$|I do {{not know}} whether Lepidoptera {{generally}} keep to the flowers of the same species; but I once observed many minute moths (I believe Lampronia (<b>Tinea)</b> calthella) apparently eating the pollen of Mercurialis annua, and they had the whole front of their bodies covered with pollen. I then went to a female plant some yards off, and saw in the course of fifteen minutes three of these moths alight on the stigmas. Lepidoptera are probably often induced to frequent the flowers of the same species, whenever these are provided with a long and narrow nectary, as in this case other insects cannot suck the nectar, which will thus be preserved for those having an elongated proboscis. No doubt the Yucca moth visits only the flowers whence its name is derived, for a most wonderful instinct guides this moth to place pollen on the stigma, so that the ovules may be developed on which the larvae feed. (11/4. Described by Mr. Riley in the 'American Naturalist' volume 7 October 1873.)With respect to Coleoptera, I have seen Meligethes covered with pollen flying from flower to flower of the same species; and this must often occur, as, according to M. Brisout, 'many of the species affect only one kind of plant." [...] (11/5. As quoted in 'American Nat.' May 1873 page 270.) ...|$|E
60|$|From which strange contexture, {{it seems}} {{rational}} {{to suppose that}} there is a certain kind of mesh or hole so small, that the Air will not very easily pass through it, as I hinted also in the sixth Observation about small Glass Canes, for otherwise it seems probable, that Nature would have drawn over some kind of thin film which should have covered all those almost square meshes or holes, there seeming through the Microscope to be more then half of the surface of the Feather which is open and visibly pervious; which conjecture will yet seem more probable from the texture of the brushie wings of the <b>Tinea</b> argentea, or white Feather wing'd moth, which I shall anone describe. But Nature, that knows best its own laws, and the several properties of bodies, knows also best how to adapt and fit them to her designed ends, and whoso would know those properties, must endeavour to trace Nature in its working, and to see what course she observes. And this I suppose will be no inconsiderable advantage which the Schematisms and Structures of Animate bodies will afford the diligent enquirer, namely, most sure and excellent instructions, both as to the practical part of Mechanicks and to the Theory and knowledge {{of the nature of the}} bodies and motions.|$|E
