25|$|Tom Daschle was Obama's {{original}} {{nominee for}} Health and Human Services Secretary. However, he owed over $128,000 in taxes over three years, {{failed to report}} more than $83,000 in consulting fees in 2007, and owed $12,000 in interest and penalties. He also provided insufficient documentation for $15,000 of the $276,000 in charitable contributions {{that he and his}} wife, Linda, gave during the three-year period being studied by the panel. Daschle also had some miscommunications with his accountant on the $255,000 use of a luxury car service that was used 80% for personal services. Daschle paid his back taxes six days before his first confirmation hearings with the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On February 3, The New York Times called the Daschle nomination into question both for his tax issues and for his extensive private sector work in the health services industry. The editorial noted that although Daschle was aware of his <b>tax</b> <b>problem</b> in June 2008, he did not correct it until his cabinet nomination. Later that day, Daschle withdrew his nomination.|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn thing out of this <b>tax</b> <b>problem.</b> I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E

50|$|Amazon says {{it would}} support a federal {{solution}} to the sales <b>tax</b> <b>problem</b> as long as such legislation was fair and simple. As of May 2011 legislation has been introduced in Congress to allow states to impose sales taxes on sales to their residents from out-of-state. Amazon has not stated a public position on the bill. Amazon's competitors say it is insincere. Similar legislation, called the Main Street Fairness Act, failed in committee in 2010. Several earlier versions of the bill also failed to advance. Amazon lobbyists met four times with members of Congress or their aides in 2010 regarding the Main Street Fairness Act. The company spent $100,000 on lobbying in 2010, although these expenses also covered other bills discussed at the same time. Amazon has increased political contributions to federal lawmakers. Amazon's political action committee spent $214,000 during the 2010 election cycle, double what it spent for the 2008 elections.|$|E

As the years 1959 - 1961 were bad in the tanker market Næss placed his attention on developing large bulk carriers and arranging [...] "affreightment" [...] contracts for them. The focus on Norness Shipping created anxiety among Anglo American shareholders as to whether enough was being done to expand that company. This created the basis for a merger between the two companies, but that was complicated as there were serious problems connected to taxation of shareholders. The <b>tax</b> <b>problem</b> for the US Norness Shipping shareholders was solved in February 1962 and the merger talks could start in detail. The final agreement was signed on 15 December 1962; the value of Næss's original $50,000 was now $44,000,000 and the new company was named Anglo Norness Shipping Company Ltd..|$|E

50|$|Following {{the results}} of the inquiry, James Hardie entered into {{negotiations}} with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of James Hardie's products. In December 2004, James Hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund. The details of the fund were to be legally determined by June 2005 but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised. Further conflicts between the company and the then Federal Government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed. It was not until November 2006, after the federal government had created 'black hole' tax legislation, which made the contributions of James Hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible, and had granted the voluntary fund tax-exempt status, that James Hardie finalised the compensation deal. There was immense pressure on the Federal Government from state governments, union leaders and victims to remove the <b>tax</b> <b>problem.</b> Sexton claims that the Federal Government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation. The final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by James Hardie shareholders. In February 2007, 99.6% of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later.|$|E
5000|$|Persons {{desiring}} to buy {{round trip}} first-class tickets between New York and Buenos Aires in April 1948, {{similar to those}} to which the petitioners were entitled, {{would have had to}} pay $2,220 for them. The petitioners, however, were not such persons. The winning of the tickets did not provide them with something which they needed in the ordinary course of their lives and for which they would have made an expenditure in any event, but merely gave them an opportunity to enjoy a luxury otherwise beyond their means. Their value to the petitioners was not equal to their retail cost. They were not transferable and not salable and there were other restrictions on their use. But even had the petitioner been permitted to sell them, his experience with other more salable articles indicates that {{he would have had to}} accept substantially less than the cost of similar tickets purchased from the steamship company and would have had selling expenses. Probably the petitioners could have refused the tickets and avoided the <b>tax</b> <b>problem.</b> Nevertheless, in order to obtain such benefits as they could from winning the tickets, they actually took a cruise accompanied by their two sons, thus obtaining free board, some savings in living expenses, and the pleasure of the trip. It seems proper that a substantial amount should *4 be included in their income for 1948 on account of the winning of the tickets. The problem of arriving at a proper fair figure for this purpose is difficult. The evidence to assist is meager, perhaps unavoidably so. The Court, under such circumstances, must arrive at some figure and has done so. Cf. Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 Fed. (2d) 540.|$|E
40|$|This paper reconsiders {{the optimal}} {{taxation}} {{of money and}} other financial assets. The optimal tax formulae reflect that money provides liquidity services and is a saving vehicle. In fact, {{it is useful to}} reformulate the optimal <b>tax</b> <b>problem</b> to allow for separate taxes on the liquidity and saving functions of money. This reformulation allows one to better understand the original optimal <b>tax</b> <b>problem.</b> The possible optimality of a subsidy on borrowing, for instance, can be explained if it is noted that the theoretically correct measure of savings reflects that money as well as nonmonetary assets can serve as saving vehicles. ...|$|E
