5|$|On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed the He 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM. That same day, Charles Lindbergh {{was visiting}} Ernst Heinkel, so Heinkel could only {{communicate}} with Udet by telephone.

5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in <b>this</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correspondence is also interesting {{for a variety}} of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding {{turned a}} ship of 500 tons {{into one of}} 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old carrack-style structure. By consequence, modern research is based mostly on interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of <b>this</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose. The construction of the original design from 1509 is less known.|$|E

5|$|The routing of US223 {{was changed}} through Adrian in 1935, {{shifting}} the highway along different streets through town.

5|$|The {{story was}} novelised by Nigel Kneale, {{his first book}} since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story {{collection}} Tomato Cain was published in 1949.
