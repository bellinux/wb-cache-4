5|$|They {{are most}} closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs. A {{minority}} of scientists, most notably Alan Feduccia and Larry Martin, have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, or that maniraptoran theropods are {{the ancestors of}} birds but <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> dinosaurs, only convergent with dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter. Their surface is {{generally}} reticular, sharp, warty or spiky and very rarely smooth. The typical colour of the spore mass becomes {{visible through the}} structure, since the spores <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the spores produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of spores are important characteristics for identifying species.|$|E

25|$|Husbands {{and wives}} are not {{presumed to be}} in a {{fiduciary}} relationship; however, this may be easily established. Similarly, ordinary commercial transactions in <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> presumed to but can give rise to fiduciary duties, should the appropriate circumstances arise. These are usually circumstances where the contract specifies a degree of trust and loyalty or it can be inferred by the court.|$|E
25|$|The souls {{on account}} of {{accumulation}} of meritorious karmas reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit karmas are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their karmas. As these devas <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.|$|E

25|$|An {{object is}} an entity that is {{represented}} by information in a database. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} phenylketonuria, it is {{important}} for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The child may develop congenital heart disease, growth retardation, microcephaly and intellectual disability as a result. PKU-affected women <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Insects can {{be divided}} into two groups {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Thysanura). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. It is possible that the Thysanura <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura).|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> using condoms.|$|E
25|$|A {{screening}} facility typically holds {{a library}} of stock plates, whose contents are carefully catalogued, and each of {{which may have been}} created by the lab or obtained from a commercial source. These stock plates <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> directly used in experiments; instead, separate assay plates are created as needed. An assay plate is simply a copy of a stock plate, created by pipetting a small amount of liquid (often measured in nanoliters) from the wells of a stock plate to the corresponding wells of a completely empty plate.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was fond}} of {{comparing}} {{the form of the}} archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.|$|E

25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|The Judges <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{exempt from}} the law; in fact they are {{expected}} to obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they will look for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
