5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in <b>the</b> <b>medium.</b> As they interact with <b>the</b> <b>medium,</b> they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 5th <b>Medium</b> Regiment {{was formed}} in England from two non-permanent batteries, namely <b>the</b> 7th <b>Medium</b> Battery (Montreal, Quebec) and <b>the</b> 23rd <b>Medium</b> Battery (Toronto, Ontario), on 22 September 1941. The {{regiment}} at this time was temporarily placed {{under the command of}} Major A. Bruce Matthews, who subsequently was promoted to Lt. Colonel. Prior to the creation of <b>the</b> 5th <b>Medium</b> Regiment, <b>the</b> 7th <b>Medium</b> Battery had been paired with <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Medium</b> Battery (Charlottetown, PEI) of <b>the</b> 1st <b>Medium</b> Regiment RCA. Similarly, <b>the</b> 23rd <b>Medium</b> Battery also belonged to <b>the</b> 1st <b>Medium</b> Regiment RCA and had been paired with <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Medium</b> Battery (Kingston, Ontario). It was not uncommon for members of each Battery to identify themselves by geographic location instead of by Battery number (e.g., as an Islander if 2nd Battery, or from Kingston, if 3rd Battery). Throughout the war there was always a friendly rivalry between these Medium batteries.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged along by <b>the</b> <b>medium,</b> {{so that the}} measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> plus the speed of <b>the</b> <b>medium.</b> Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but {{the magnitude of the}} effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
