5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem.

Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
