25|$|Myshkin {{follows the}} Yepanchins {{back to their}} dacha, where {{eventually}} Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya and is desperately seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>he</b> persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E
500|$|Dave Trumbore {{felt the}} Arrow episode tied up the {{introduction}} of Hawkgirl and Hawkman and their nemesis Vandal Savage, and effectively set up the launch of The CW's mid-season, spin-off Legends of <b>Tomorrow.</b> <b>He</b> gave it 4 stars out of 5. He added that the crossover specials [...] "do a fantastic job of pulling back the camera to reveal the wider world that their heroes and villains share". Jonathon Dornbush was impressed with Carlos Valdes' performance, saying: [...] "While Oliver naturally takes center stage — and Stephen Amell {{steps up to the}} task, arguably giving his best performance on the show yet — the secret MVP of the hour is Carlos Valdes' Cisco, who also happens to steal The Flashs half of the crossover." ...|$|E
