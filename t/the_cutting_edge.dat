5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|On the September 7, 2015 {{episode of}} Raw, he and Christian made a {{backstage}} appearance with Seth Rollins, The New Day, and The Dudley Boyz. On November 15, 2016, the 900th episode of SmackDown, Edge hosted {{a special edition}} of <b>The</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> with the men's SmackDown Survivor Series team members as his guests and was later interrupted by the returning Undertaker.|$|E
5|$|The masseteric crests (crests on {{the outer}} sides of the mandibles) reach their front ends below the front border of the first molars. Usually, the capsular process (a {{projection}} {{at the back of}} the mandible housing the root of the lower incisor) is well-developed. The enamel of the upper incisors is yellowish-orange and the incisors are orthodont (with their cutting edge perpendicular to the plane of the toothrow) or slightly opisthodont (with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> inclined backwards). In contrast, Akodon simulator has more proodont incisors (with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> oriented forwards) and Akodon neocenus has more opisthodont incisors. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in A.caenosus, but are unlike the very hypsodont molars of A.budini. The molar rows are relatively longer than in A.polopi. There are 13 or 14 thoracic (chest), 7 or 8 lumbar (abdomen), and 23 or 26 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, <b>the</b> microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, <b>the</b> major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively. The thrust modeling of <b>the</b> major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and second <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> includes two different kinds of processes: shearing and ploughing. The indentation zone is modeled as a rigid wedge. The force model is verified by comparing the predicted forces and <b>the</b> measured <b>cutting</b> forces...|$|R

5|$|At Extreme Rules, Edge {{helped his}} friend Christian {{to win the}} vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Edge was in Christian's corner for his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton but, {{disappointed}} by the cowardly tactics Christian used to win his second World Heavyweight Championship, berated him and walked out on him. Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time. On the September 16, 2011 episode of SmackDown, {{in his hometown of}} Toronto, Edge hosted <b>The</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show went off the air, they held Edge Appreciation Night to celebrate his career.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> are so small, {{they can}} often be touched when {{spinning}} by a finger without <b>cutting</b> <b>the</b> skin, which flexes out of the way, although {{it would not be}} safe to pinch or grip them from two sides. Hard metal or ceramic workpieces cannot flex beyond <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> so <b>the</b> tools remove material from them. This characteristic makes them suitable for dentistry, as the tool will grind the hard enamel of teeth, yet leaves soft mouth tissues unharmed if the tool should unintentionally touch them.|$|R

5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} male {{is mostly a}} deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones on <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of {{the tooth}} {{inclined}} backwards. The {{root of the}} lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process {{at the back of}} the jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are quite similar to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E
40|$|Turn milling {{is still}} a {{relatively}} un common process for precision manufacturing of axially symmetric components. In this process, chip formation is realized by a combined rotation of the workpiece and <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> tool. Due to its special kinematics, turn milling offers potential for cutting of difficult-to-machine materials, such as particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. The heterogeneous microstructure of these materials with comparatively soft matrix and hard ceramic particles causes high dynamic loads on <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> have to withstand the highly abrasive effect of the hard particles. This requires the application of wear-resistant cutting materials, including particularly diamond-based cutting materials. However, their use as tippings imposes design limitations for <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. In this investigation, cutting tests on an aluminium alloy reinforced with 15 per cent by volume alumina particles were performed using end mills with different minor <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles in orthogonal and tangential turn milling. After a short cutting time, during tangential turn milling <b>the</b> flat <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometry resulted in vibrations of the tool and a poor workpiece surface quality. In contrast, orthogonal turn milling produced no vibrations and enabled higher feed velocities when reducing <b>the</b> minor <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles from 1 ° to 0 °...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the temperature profile along <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of a drill and {{describes how the}} temperature on the chisel edge can exceed the temperature on <b>the</b> primary <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> A finite element model predicts the temperature distribution in the drill, where the heat flux loads applied to the finite element model are determined from analytical equations. The model for the heat flux loads considers both the heat generated on the shear plane and the heat generated on the rake face of the tool to {{determine the amount of}} heat flowing into the tool on each segment of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Contrary to <b>the</b> conventional belief that the maximum temperature occurs near the outer corner of the drill, the model predicts that the maximum temperature occurs on the chisel edge, which is consistent with experimental measurements of the temperature profile...|$|R
5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|E
5|$|The tooth is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> at the front side is further {{from the middle of the}} tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> oriented backwards. The molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and have two rows of main cusps separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller cusps. The first upper molar is broader than in T.talamancae. As in this species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, it is similar to T.talamancae but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two on the outer {{and one on the}} inner side) and each of the lowers has two (one at the front and another at the back).|$|E
40|$|AbstractA major {{percentage}} of the kinematic energy during the grinding process is converted into heat. The energy conversion is significantly influenced by the grinding wheel topography.

25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> plane off <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> hole. By <b>cutting</b> <b>the</b> periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|R
5|$|The {{predominant}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{heading into}} the pay-per-view was between Edge and Batista, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title, and Edge won the bout with a school boy pin. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand. Batista won a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay, Kane, and Mark Henry to earn the spot of the challenger at the pay-per-view. Batista was a guest on Edge's talk show <b>The</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> on the June 1 episode of SmackDown!. Towards {{the end of the}} segment, Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor. The following night, on Saturday Night's Main Event, Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a tag team match. During the match, Edge walked out, leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit. Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisor is opisthodont, with <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> {{oriented}} backward. As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, the molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests). The first upper molar is narrower than in T.bolivaris.

On the upper third molar, the hypoflexus (which in oryzomyines ranges from a slight indentation on the lingual, or inner, side of the tooth to a conspicuous valley between the main cusps) is more developed in Euryoryzomys than in Transandinomys. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, extends more than halfway across the crown; it is much shorter in H.alfaroi, Euryoryzomys, and Hylaeamys yunganus.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{placement}} of self-tapping implants {{is associated with}} microfractures {{and the formation of}} bone chips along <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> flutes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles on chip formation during the machining of trabecular and cortical bone using instruments with a rough titanium surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mandibular cortical and trabecular bone specimens were obtained from freshly slaughtered domestic pigs. A predefined thrust force was applied to the specimens. Four specially designed cutting instruments that simulated dental implants and had a rough titanium surface were allowed to complete one full revolution at <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles of 55, 65, 75, and 85 degrees, respectively. Torque and thrust were measured during <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> process. Bone chips were measured and weighed under a microscope. RESULTS: Different <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles did not lead to significant differences in torque. The lowest torque values were measured when <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> were positioned at 65 degrees in trabecular bone and at 85 degrees in cortical bone. Bone chips were significantly larger and heavier at angles of 55 and 65 degrees than at angles of 75 and 85 degrees in trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: Instruments with a rough titanium surface show considerable angle-dependent differences in chip formation. In addition to bone density, the angle of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> should be taken into consideration during the {{placement of}} dental implants. Good results were obtained when <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> were positioned at an angle of 65 degrees. This angle can have positive effects on osseointegration...|$|R
