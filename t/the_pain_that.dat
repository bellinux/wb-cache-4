She then falls for a boy at her school, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee), who rescues Clare from her old gang after they turn on her for leaving their clique. They start dating — despite Nigel's objections — though their romance hits a brief setback when Clare discovers that his mother is also her teacher, Julie. Despite her initial upset, Clare comes round and she is happy when Nigel and Julie begin dating. When Julie gets a job in Scotland, Nigel and Clare decide to join her and Josh, leaving Walford in April 1998.|$|E

Michael Paoletta of Billboard praised Clarkson's vocal, writing [...] "Clarkson simply delivers a loose, tour-de-force vocal that simmers alongside a steroid-charged musical backdrop that is fun, fast and furious." [...] Scott Juba of The Trade praised the production of the song, writing [...] "The song’s strong hook pulls listeners in and involves them in the lyrics without ever becoming gimmicky or manipulative."

Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and benzocaine, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. [...] It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.|$|E

Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not to react to <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>that</b> palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called [...] "stewarding", {{in reference to the}} horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present. Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years, soring is still practiced and criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end soring.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{performance of the}} album, Pornography was not well received by most music critics upon its release. NME reviewer Dave Hill was ambivalent towards the album, writing that it [...] "portrays and parades its currency of exposed futility and utterly naked fear with so few distractions or adornments, and so little sense of shame. It really piles it on. The Cure have applied themselves to catching a related collection of the very purest feelings endemeic to their age, and holding them right on the spot in their intangible, unspecified, unmanageable and most unpleasantly real form." [...] Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "It's downhill all the way, into ever-darkening shadows... passing through chilly marbled archways to the final rendezvous with the cold comfort of the slab". Dave McCullough of Sounds felt that despite a [...] "genuine talent still at work", Pornography [...] "has too much music too cluttered a backing for Smith's well-intended observance [...] Robert Smith seems locked in himself, a spiralling nightmare that leaves The Cure making a pompous sounding music that is, when all's said and done, dryly meaningless". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, derided Smith's [...] "glum" [...] lyrics and felt that he should [...] "cheer up". Rolling Stone critic J. D.

It isn't <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>that</b> irks, it's the persistent dullness". Trouser Press Charles McCardell, on the other hand, found that the Cure [...] "imposes an order that at first seems contrary to the basic preconceptions of rock 'n' roll" [...] – noting that [...] "for them, lyrics are everything" [...] and that instruments had been relegated to [...] "merely creating atmosphere" [...] – and hailed Pornography as an [...] "uncompromising and challenging" [...] work." ...|$|E
