5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, HKHRM Director Mr Law Yuk Kai and the Democratic Party Chairperson Lee Chu Ming went on {{a one-week}} visit to the United States. They had {{meetings}} {{with a number of}} government officials and some non-governmental organisations. In the meetings, they explained the Article 23 legislation {{and its impact on the}} life and human rights of Hong Kong citizens. The media and government officials expressed understanding and concerns on <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the Hong Kong public.|$|E
25|$|With this defeat, the Japanese Burma Area Army {{was reduced}} to an {{ineffective}} fighting force. With the majority of Burma liberated, word that Japan had surrendered on 15 August only increased <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese {{to get to the}} Tenasserim hills. They did not however wish to be immobilised on the eastern bank of the Sittang so another 2,000 more died after the battle had been fought, many in the first days of peace. It was the last big battle on land of World War II involving the Western Allies.|$|E
25|$|Bloom {{has a deep}} {{appreciation}} for Shakespeare and considers {{him to be the}} supreme center of the Western canon. The first edition of <b>The</b> <b>Anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Influence almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom considered, at the time, barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, adds a long preface that mostly expounds on Shakespeare's debt to Ovid and Chaucer, and his agon with his contemporary Christopher Marlowe, who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.|$|E

25|$|Colette was 67 {{years old}} at the fall of France, and {{remained}} in Paris, in her apartment in the Palais Royal. Her husband Maurice Goudeket, a Jew, was arrested by the Gestapo in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived {{through the rest of the}} war years with <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> a possible second arrest. During the Occupation she produced two volumes of memoirs, Journal à rebours (1941) and De ma fenêtre (1942 — the two issued in English in 1975 as Looking Backwards).|$|E
25|$|As a boy, Bloom read Hart Crane's Collected Poems, a {{collection}} that inspired his lifelong fascination with poetry. Bloom {{went to the}} Bronx High School of Science (where his grades were poor but his standardized-test scores were high), and subsequently received a B.A. from Cornell in 1951, {{where he was a}} student of English literary critic M.H. Abrams, and a PhD from Yale in 1955. Bloom was a standout student at Yale, where he clashed with the faculty of New Critics including William K. Wimsatt. Several years later, Bloom dedicated his first major book, <b>The</b> <b>Anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Influence, to Wimsatt.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their second}} album, The Band {{embarked}} {{on their first}} tour as a lead act. <b>The</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. Stage Fright (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock, but the fraying of the group's once-fabled unity was beginning to show. As on their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited {{with most of the}} songwriting. However, the trademark vocal style of The Band's three lead singers was much less prominent on this work.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose {{construction of}} heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. Homophobic bullying is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the company}} in the train were four ladies, who are deserving of honourable mention, from the courage they {{displayed}} in accompanying it, namely, Mrs. Nichs. Wood, and Miss F. Wood, Mrs. I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train, but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It seemed from its noiselessness, rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
50|$|According to Paul Wells, {{the film}} deals with <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> <b>of</b> British culture in {{regarding}} sexual repression, patriarchal obsession, voyeuristic pleasure and perverse violence. The impossible {{task in the}} film is the quest to photograph fear itself.|$|R
60|$|But {{all these}} things came merely as interludes in the moving {{currents}} of greater events; for as the summer faded into autumn and autumn into winter <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trustees of St. Asaph's began to call for action of some sort.|$|R

[...] "It will crown my life" [...] he said. We will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called [...] "God's noblest waterway".|$|E
500|$|Standard countered {{and held}} back its {{shipments}} and, {{with the help}} of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest. Rockefeller prevailed and the railroad sold its oil interests to Standard. But in the aftermath of that battle, in 1879 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil's business practices. Rockefeller was under great strain during the 1870s and 1880s when he was carrying out his plan of consolidation and integration and being attacked by the press. He complained that he could not stay asleep most nights. Rockefeller later commented:"All the fortune that I have made has not served to compensate me for <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> that period." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{second factor}} was <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> Congress {{to see more}} silver made into coin. [...] This was due to {{pressure}} from mining and other interests. [...] The Coinage Act of 1873 ended the practice of allowing silver producers to have their bullion struck into silver dollars and returned to them. [...] Although producers had not deposited much silver {{in the years before}} 1873 due to high market prices, former mint director Henry Linderman foresaw that those prices would fall as mines became accessible due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad across the United States, and that the resultant coinage would inflate the currency. [...] He quietly urged Congress to end the practice, which it did. [...] Within a year, silver prices had dropped, and producers tried vainly to deposit bullion at the mints for conversion into legal tender. [...] Mining interests sought other means of selling silver to the government.|$|E

500|$|The {{constant}} {{snow and}} thick mists {{made it difficult}} for Bartlett to calculate the Karluk's position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August. On 3 October <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just [...] distant, the drift turned northwards, away from the land. There were fears among some that Karluk would repeat the experience of the Jeannette, an American vessel that 30years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew. Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.|$|E
500|$|Seth {{finds it}} hard to {{understand}} the fact that the cartoonist he admires could give up a cartooning career and still find happiness in the last twenty years of his life; he come to accept it after a visit to Kalo's mother in a nursing home. [...] He discovers that his Kalo collection may always remain incomplete—though the family once had a scrapbook filled with Kalo's cartoons, they long ago threw it away. [...] By the end of the story, Seth has found a mere eleven of them. [...] When Kalo's mother reveals Kalo's contentment with his choice to give up cartooning, Seth must face <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> his life choices and what a [...] "good life" [...] may mean to him. [...] As a mother who has outlived her son yet does not mire herself in the past, Mrs Kalloway provides an unsentimental contrast to how Seth views and deals with the world.|$|E
500|$|By June 2012, the Russo {{brothers}} entered {{negotiations to}} direct the sequel, and Samuel L. Jackson was confirmed to return as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury. Feige sought out the Russos after watching the genre-parodying season 2 finale of Community which they directed, and for the additional ideas they brought to the initial story pitch. Joe Russo detailed that since the intent was for a political thriller, [...] "all the great political thrillers have very current issues in them that reflect <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>of</b> the audience." [...] Thus the brothers opted to include references to drone warfare, targeted killing and global surveillance. Joe even noted how during principal photography, the issues became more topical due to the disclosure of several National Security Agency surveillance-related documents. At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, {{it was announced that}} the official title for the sequel was Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and that the Russo brothers would direct the film. After signing on to direct, the Russo brothers met with Ed Brubaker to learn more about where the Winter Soldier character came from, his thinking and the themes behind the character. In July 2012, Anthony Mackie entered negotiations to star as Falcon alongside Chris Evans in the sequel. Sebastian Stan was also confirmed to be reprising his role as James Barnes. By August 2012, Anna Kendrick, Felicity Jones, and Imogen Poots were being considered front-runners for {{a leading role in the}} film.|$|E
