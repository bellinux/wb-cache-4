50|$|<b>Two-shot</b> <b>injection</b> molding: TPV can be {{combined}} with polymers through several types of multi-shot injection molding processes. By combining multiple materials, {{a wide variety of}} parts applications, such as a hard/soft combination, can be achieved. The process produces both a finished part and a substrate during each cycle. Two-shot molding is more efficient than insert molding because no handling of the substrate is required.|$|E
