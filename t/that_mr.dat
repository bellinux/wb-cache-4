5|$|Anne learns {{from an old}} friend, Mrs. Smith (Helen Schlesinger), <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Elliot is {{bankrupt}} {{and only}} interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne also is told <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.|$|E
5|$|Larry tells Darrin <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brockway {{has insisted}} that Darrin {{be removed from the}} account. Darrin and Samantha host a Christmas party which Larry, Keith, and Dorothy attend. When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy {{standing}} next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> Brinkley saw <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Pasmer {{wished to}} confine {{the meaning of}} their talk to Miss Anderson, and she assented, with a {{penetration}} of which she saw <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Pasmer was gratefully aware.|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} already stated <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Plornish, not being philosophical, wept. It further {{happened}} <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Plornish, not being philosophical, was intelligible. It may have arisen {{out of her}} softened state of mind, out of her sex's wit, out of a woman's quick association of ideas, or out of a woman's no association of ideas, but it further happened somehow <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Plornish's intelligibility displayed itself upon the very subject of Arthur's meditations.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Higgins, who was {{an elderly}} widow, 'well left', {{reflected}} with complacency <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Parrot's observation {{was no more than}} just, and <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Jennings very likely belonged to a family which had had no funerals to speak of.|$|R
5|$|Mr Awasthi bluntly categorizes it as mental retardation, but Nikumbh criticizes him. Nikumbh {{argues that}} Ishaan is an above average child and {{processes}} information differently. He further states <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Awasthi {{failed to understand}} Ishaan {{and as a result}} the latter is facing low self-esteem and no longer paints, and Mr Awasthi regrets everything he did to Ishaan.|$|E
5|$|Two {{books were}} {{released}} {{related to the}} original series: Mr. Bean's Diary in 1992 and Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format {{in which they are}} printed. The content of both is a template diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bean lives in Highbury and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.|$|E
5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps <b>Mr</b> Dorrit thought <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> General {{had done}} well in being {{overcome}} by the disappointment of his not arriving.

50|$|Mrs. Clarke: Nate's English {{teacher who}} first {{appeared}} on September 12, 1991.

5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{at first}} {{goes to the}} Kwik-E-Mart and {{purchases}} Buzz Cola, then gets into more routine tasks, such as giving Lisa her science project or going to work. At {{the end of the}} day, Homer is sent home from work and watches a news report on TV, which informs him that the mysterious cameras and black vans are being spotted all across town. He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house, and decides to pursue it, leading him to Mr. Burns' mansion. Homer concludes <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns is responsible, and goes to confront him. However, Burns reveals that the black vans were pizza delivery vans, and proceeds to fire and release his guard dogs on Homer.|$|E
60|$|The ladies {{thought the}} old woman doting, led thereto by the remark of Keziah, the maid, <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mason have a lost her memory. And she asked who the other bonny lady was, and Ethel told her <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Pendennis {{was a friend of}} the Colonel's and Clive's.|$|R
60|$|Seeing <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Keith was {{watching}} her, {{she was glad}} of the chance of explaining {{that she had not}} renewed her acquaintance with the Colonel. As she had now spent a fortnight with Mrs. Foster, who knew him well, this should disarm any suspicion <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Keith might entertain.|$|R
6000|$|... "She has deceived me again," [...] {{said the}} Countess, tearing the letter into atoms.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, {{prompting}} Nila to take Pari {{and move to}} Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled with pictures of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wahdati loves him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after {{he is unable to}} find someone suitable to take over for him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati. He develops a deep bond with his employer, and Nabi comes to the realization that his purpose is to take care of Mr. Wahdati. Later Mr. Wahdati's health deteriorates further, and Nabi helps him commit assisted suicide by kissing him on the lips and pressing a pillow over his face.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead. Mr. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|E
5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies {{than in the}} two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} delight <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Barker {{had seen that}} the {{attention}} of the next table was directed to them, and <b>that</b> even <b>Mrs.</b> Horncastle had glanced from time to time at Stacy. But she was not prepared for the evident equal effect <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Horncastle had created upon Stacy. His cold face warmed, his critical eye softened; he asked her name. Mrs. Barker was voluble, prejudiced, and, it seemed, misinformed.|$|R

5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing but good things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|She began a {{four-year}} term on 10 December 2007, facing challenges including: inflation, poor public security, international credibility, a faulty energy infrastructure, and protests from the agricultural sectors over {{an increase of}} nearly 30% on export taxes. Kirchner was the second female president of Argentina, after Isabel MartÃ­nez de PerÃ³n but, unlike PerÃ³n, {{was elected to the}} office, whereas Isabel PerÃ³n was elected Juan PerÃ³n's vice president, and automatically assumed the presidency on his death. The transition from NÃ©stor Kirchner to Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner was also the first time a democratic head of state was replaced by their spouse without the death of either. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been compared with those of Juan and Eva PerÃ³n and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Media observers suspected <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kirchner stepped down as president to circumvent the term limit, swapping roles with his wife.|$|E

5|$|The {{attendant}} tells Scully <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Milsap is {{the only}} person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogavare was toppled in {{a vote of}} no confidence.

Opposition leader Fred Fono promised in November <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Moti would be extradited if the opposition came to power. The Fiji Times suggested <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Moti might then flee to Fiji. After Derek Sikua was elected Prime Minister later in December, he said <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Moti would be deported to Australia.|$|E
6000|$|The {{evidence}} for inspiration is further augmented by {{the testimony of}} Rev.
