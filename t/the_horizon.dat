The team {{got off to}} a 12–1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid-season coaching award. On February 5, Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66–61. In so doing, Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer. Butler finished first in <b>the</b> <b>Horizon</b> League with a 15–3 in conference record, defying preseason expectations. Butler lost <b>the</b> <b>Horizon</b> League tournament final 57–54 to Cleveland State, but made the NCAA tournament as an at-large selection.

40|$|The thermodynamical {{properties}} of dark energy are usually investigated with {{the equation of}} state ω =ω_ 0 +ω_ 1 z. Recent observations show that our universe is accelerating, and <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> and <b>the</b> event <b>horizon</b> vary with redshift z. When definitions of the temperature and entropy {{of a black hole}} are used to <b>the</b> two <b>horizons</b> of <b>the</b> universe, we examine the thermodynamical {{properties of}} the universe which is enveloped by <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> and <b>the</b> event <b>horizon</b> respectively. We show that the first and the second laws of thermodynamics inside <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> in any redshift are satisfied, while they are broken down inside <b>the</b> event <b>horizon</b> in some redshift. Therefore, <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> for <b>the</b> universe may be the boundary of thermodynamical equilibrium for the universe like <b>the</b> event <b>horizon</b> for a black hole.

5000|$|B horizons form below an O, A, or E {{horizon and}} they have {{undergone}} sufficient changes during soil genesis, such that the properties of their original parent material are no longer discernible. <b>The</b> B <b>horizon</b> is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "subsoil". In humid regions, B <b>horizons</b> are <b>the</b> layers of maximum accumulation of materials such as silicate clays, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and organic material. These materials typically accumulate through a process termed illuviation, wherein the materials gradually wash in from <b>the</b> overlying <b>horizons.</b> Accordingly, this layer is also referred to as the [...] "illuviated" [...] <b>horizon</b> or <b>the</b> [...] "zone of accumulation". In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than <b>the</b> <b>horizon(s)</b> above and <b>the</b> <b>horizon(s)</b> below. <b>The</b> B <b>horizon</b> may also have stronger colors (higher chroma) than <b>the</b> A <b>horizon.</b> In arid and semiarid regions, calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate may accumulate in <b>the</b> B <b>horizon.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> due East and due West (if <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

30|$|In the Futures Map frame it is {{possible}} to solve the conceptual problem concerning scenarios, roadmaps and plans using the distinction between the planning and <b>the</b> mapping <b>horizons.</b> <b>The</b> mapping <b>horizon</b> is <b>the</b> anticipation <b>horizon</b> of <b>the</b> Futures Map (of the possible futures). As in picture 1, a scenario path might de facto end already before <b>the</b> mapping <b>horizon.</b> For example in the Futures Map of a company, the bankruptcy of the company might be an end point for the individual company, but in fact, the scenario without this company might be going on, unconsidered by the managers of the company. However, <b>the</b> time <b>horizon</b> of most scenarios is defined by <b>the</b> mapping <b>horizon.</b> As in <b>the</b> picture, there might be many scenario paths to the same end point of <b>the</b> mapping <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
