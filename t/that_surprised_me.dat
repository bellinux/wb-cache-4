60|$|And {{once she}} sprang a {{question}} on me suddenly <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I too, {{looked at}} the cottage, and made a {{discovery}} <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> {{at one of the}} upper windows.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited for}} my reply to this last inquiry with an {{appearance}} of anxiety <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> I had never heard him speak of Low Lanes.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} said something--something <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> from you, and hurts me. I wish to know whether you say it from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a world's wonder! There is {{only one}} thing <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> Was it by {{accident}} that one window was left unfinished?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The thing <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> most," [...] remarked the boss, [...] "is that Brazos doesn't come back. He was foaled on this range, and he's {{never been}} ridden {{anywhere}} else, has he?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{showed no}} resentment at my patronage, but a {{self-sufficiency}} {{that made my}} sympathy seem superfluous, giving the impression of an inner harmony and content <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't strange. I've had English ideas {{impressed}} on me pretty forcibly {{during the}} last few months. But you made a statement <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> Does Colston trust me?" ...|$|E
60|$|While {{my mother}} and I were talking in a low tone about Nicholas, I could not avoid hearing parts of a {{conversation}} between my sister and Ivanka <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> much.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{not that}} I wonder at, Peter; it's the putting of such splendid work in such dark narrow lanes <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> Why {{do they go}} to so much expense {{in such a place}} as this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! Well, I own <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me,</b> for I {{thought your}} eyes could see anything! Now to me nothing is plainer than that gore and that fish; and I must say, my honest friend, {{that in your}} place I should {{apprehend}} that my sight was beginning to fail." ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. Yes: <b>that's</b> what <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> He's {{so desperately}} afraid of Ann. There must be {{something}} the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I {{found that}} you always {{travelled}} with ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds in a box, <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> very much. I thought {{that you were a}} very dangerous companion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Do, Harry; {{that is true}} friendship!' {{says the}} Chief, with a {{gentleness}} <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> 'Now that your old friend is in a difficulty, 'tis surely {{the best time to}} leave him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Aggie was {{the name}} of the old nurse; he had not thought of her till now; but that he should think of her at all was a trait <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> in the man.|$|E
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. <b>That's</b> what <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> They're a jolly sight {{more certain}} over this than they've ever been {{over their own}} interests.|$|R
50|$|Why <b>That</b> Doesn't <b>Surprise</b> <b>Me</b> is {{the sixth}} album by The Lucksmiths, {{released}} on 5 March 2001 on Candle Records (catalogue number CAN2513).|$|R
6000|$|... "Literally, she is. But {{she has not}} emancipated herself morally {{quite so}} far, I trust, as to choose a husband without {{consulting}} me. I have left her at liberty, but I have {{not been in the}} least indifferent. The truth is that your little affair has come to a head with a rapidity <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> It was only the other day that Catherine made your acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> The {{police were}} {{watching}} {{me every day}} as a cat watches a mouse, and thought that they surely had got the thief when they found that I had dealings with Benjamin. Well; you--you were laughing at me in your sleeve all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I frightened you, Hopkins. The state of my nerves. Mrs. Glenarm {{was a little}} sudden with some news <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> I am better now--and able {{to attend to the}} {{household}} matters. There is a mistake in the butcher's account. Send the cook here." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the dimness}} {{of the landing}} I could not see him very well, but there was {{something}} in his voice <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> I knew he was of abstemious habit or I should have thought he had been drinking. I led the way into my sitting room and asked him to sit down.|$|E
6000|$|... "'All right,' says I. 'I'll admit <b>that</b> she <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> But it's {{the first}} time I ever knew one of 'em to {{manipulate}} a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way,' says I.|$|R
6000|$|Mr Dorrit frowned, {{and looked}} {{anything}} but pleased. 'Amy,' he returned, 'it appears to me, I must say, {{that you have}} had abundance of time for <b>that.</b> Ha--you <b>surprise</b> <b>me.</b> You disappoint me. Fanny has conquered any such little difficulties, and--hum--why not you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Helène continued, [...] "I {{ought not}} to ask, but I must confess <b>that</b> you have <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> Is Lord Wolfenden--your lover?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mary Warren {{manifested}} {{a spirit}} and an intelligence <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> She expressed her own {{belief that the}} proscribed classes of the country had only {{to be true to}} themselves to be restored to their just rights, and that on the very principle by which they were so fast losing them. The opinions she thus expressed are worthy of being recorded.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was one part, doctor, <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> {{even more}} than the rest--that was the part {{relating}} to the man Forester. I don't believe a soul suspected him of being in any way connected with the crime. At least we heard nothing of a knife being found, nor, of course, of the quarrel between Forester and the girl; Ruth Powlett, was it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miserrimus Dexter {{had sunk}} {{down in the}} chair. The rough man lifted his master with a {{gentleness}} <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Hide my face," [...] I heard Dexter say to him, in broken tones. He opened his coarse pilot-jacket, and hid his master's head under it, and so went silently out--with the deformed creature held to his bosom, like a woman sheltering her child.|$|E
60|$|You {{will see}} how closely I went with him, by my minding so slight an {{incident}} in so fine a performance. There is no one who could approach him in it; and I am bound to add <b>that</b> he <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> {{as much as he}} pleased me.|$|R
6000|$|The {{meal was}} no sooner over than Ghip-Ghisizzle {{was summoned to}} the chamber of his Majesty the Boolooroo, but before he went away, he took Trot and Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright into a small room and advised them to stay there until he {{returned}} so that the servants and soldiers would not molest them. [...] "My people seem to dislike strangers," [...] said the Majordomo thoughtfully, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> because you are the first strangers they have ever seen. I think they imagine you will become favorites of the Boolooroo and of the Princesses, {{and that is why}} they are jealous and hate you." ...|$|R
6000|$|There stood Tom May, {{like one}} petrified, deaf {{to the words}} around, his dazzled {{eyes fixed on the}} letters, his faculties {{concentrated}} in the endeavour to ascertain whether they were sight or imagination. Yes, there they were, the very words in the well-known writing, the school-boy's forming into the clerk's, there was the blot {{in the top of the}} L! Tom's heart gave one wild bound, then all sensation, except the sight of the writing, ceased, the exclamations of those around him came surging gradually on his ear, as if from a distance, and he did not yet hear them distinctly when he replied alertly, almost lightly, 'Here is a name <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me.</b> Let me look at the patient again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not so,’ {{said the}} Count. ‘I have an alternative. I have just drawn my balance at my banker’s, a {{considerable}} sum, and I am now {{to place it}} in your hands. It will be so much for you and so much less—’ he paused, and smiled {{with an air of}} malignity <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> ‘But it is necessary it should be done before witnesses. Monsieur le Vicomte is of a particular disposition, and an unwitnessed donation may very easily be twisted into a theft.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Another thing <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> was {{the fact}} that so much had been {{accomplished}} in so short a time, for I could not believe that I had been gone from Anoroc for a sufficient period to permit of building a fleet of fifty feluccas and mining iron ore for the cannon and balls, to say nothing of manufacturing these guns and the crude muzzle-loading rifles with which every Mezop was armed, as well as the gunpowder and ammunition they had in such ample quantities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chevalier {{says that}} a young Jew swam the same {{distance}} for his [...] mistress; and Oliver mentions its having been done by a Neapolitan; [...] but our consul, Tarragona, remembered neither of these circumstances, [...] and tried to dissuade us from the attempt. A number of the [...] 'Salsette''s crew were known to have accomplished a greater distance; [...] {{and the only thing}} <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> was that, as doubts had been [...] entertained of the truth of Leander's story, no traveller had ever [...] endeavoured to ascertain its practicability." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{considering}} {{all of the}} issues and queries that have arisen throughout the SCEiP project, perhaps one of the ones <b>that</b> still <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> is the “but I can’t do both” statement. The idea that it’s not possible to achieve both academic and practice impact, and that researchers have to focus on activities to generate one or the other, but can’t manage both...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Junius. [...] "I had no {{difficulty}} in understanding it, although I must say <b>that</b> it <b>surprised</b> <b>me.</b> But I came because I am {{not satisfied with}} the condition of things here, and I wish to be on the spot. I do not understand why you and Miss March should be invited here during my absence." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his {{entry for}} November 27, 1935, Sebastian concludes: [...] "I am {{waiting for the}} day when [...] make their peace with Sandu Tudor [...] and {{discover}} that the Jews are alone responsible for the quarrel—especially myself, who has aroused discord among the Christian fraternity. It sounds like a joke, but it's plausible enough." [...] Almost a year later, when Credința focused its attack on Sebastian, the latter noted: [...] "The only thing <b>that</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> is <b>that</b> the attack came so late." [...] Tudor and Stancu were defeated in court, and were obliged to formally recant. Ornea, who writes that Credința only published the verdict with much reluctance and discretion ("somewhere deep in the pages of one issue"), concludes that the scandal was a decisive blow for Criterion, causing Eliade's club to dissolve itself.|$|R
