A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E

5|$|Tom <b>Thumb,</b> Fielding's sixth play, {{was added}} to the ninth showing of The Author's Farce, 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were {{replaced}} by Fielding's next production, Rape upon Rape. Tom <b>Thumb</b> was later included with other productions, including Rape upon Rape, and later transformed into the Tragedy of Tragedies. In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works. The plot deals with the English hero, Tom <b>Thumb,</b> who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom <b>Thumb</b> is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca. Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an untimely death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat. The farcical nature of Tom <b>Thumb</b> pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy, gender roles and gender politics.|$|E

5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable <b>thumb.</b> However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the <b>thumb,</b> the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the M-83 {{designation}} {{was used}} for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The <b>Thumb</b> area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The {{gap between the two}} roads was eliminated within a year. By the end of the 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing The <b>Thumb</b> area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.|$|E

Additional features were observed in 88 % (22 / 25). In 25 % (4 / 16) of the patients with adducted <b>thumbs</b> and congenital hydrocephalus L 1 CAM gene mutations were identified.
