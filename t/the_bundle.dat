5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> would be good value for money.|$|E

5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> of His were {{discovered}} {{as early as}} the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E

5|$|The {{enlisted men}} were leery {{of working with}} deadly {{explosives}} but were told by officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs and shells, involved using levers and crowbars from boxcars, {{in which they were}} packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand a short distance into place. This series of actions was rough enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard edition, the Collector's Edition was made available for purchase for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which included a steelbook case, a collectible figurine, a digital download code for the animated film , {{the first issue of}} the Injustice comic book series, and three exclusive costumes for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman based on their appearances in The New 52. The North American and European versions of <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> offered different figurines. The North American release offers a 13-inch (33cm) statue featuring Wonder Woman fighting Batman, while the European release offers a smaller 9-inch (23cm) statue of the two. The Battle Edition, exclusive to GameStop and EB Games, included a light weight fight stick controller and the three DLC skins. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the Special Edition was available, exclusively through Game and EB Games respectively, containing the steelbook case and the Red Son Pack.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E

30|$|The {{temporary}} {{resistance of}} the interior CNTs in this system is due to their larger contact surface with their neighboring nanotube and less contact surface with the surrounding ILs. For <b>the</b> <b>bundled</b> systems, {{it was found that}} they severely resist against the solvent separating forces. This happens because in these systems, the sum of π–π interactions between the common surfaces of the nanotube molecules is larger than these interactions in the corresponding non-bundled systems due to the less contact surface of the solvent with <b>the</b> <b>bundled</b> CNTs. <b>The</b> comparison of the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>bundled</b> systems with <b>the</b> non-bundled ones shows this fact that the stability of <b>the</b> <b>bundled</b> system against separation is more than the similar non-bundled ones.|$|R

5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Humble eBook Bundle, John Scalzi {{noted that}} various factors, such as brand name recognition, a lack of DRM, a focus on charity, the {{uniqueness}} of <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> and its format, and the variety of included authors, all made the Humble eBook Bundle a success. Scalzi notes that while people who participate in Humble Bundles will get less in net profit than they would have without <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> (due to the variable percentages patrons can donate and publishers taking their cut of proceeds), but in return receive greater volume (the Humble Bundle sold 42,000 copies of eBooks in two weeks, almost as much as the average monthly bestseller). In conclusion, Scalzi lauds the idea of the Humble Bundle, and notes to future contributors that while <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> is low-margin, it's also low-risk. Novelist Cory Doctorow, who organized both eBook bundles, noted that while no publisher aside from Tor Books would participate in <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> because of no-DRM stipulations, they still raised around $2 million for books whose circulations were earning their authors little to no money.|$|E
25|$|A sphere bundle is {{partially}} characterized by its Euler class, {{which is a}} degree n+1 cohomology class in the total space of <b>the</b> <b>bundle.</b> In the case n=1 the sphere bundle is called a circle bundle and the Euler class {{is equal to the}} first Chern class, which characterizes the topology of <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> completely.

25|$|Another {{special class}} of fiber bundles, called {{principal}} bundles, are bundles on whose fibers {{a free and}} transitive action by a group G is given, so that each fiber is a principal homogeneous space. <b>The</b> <b>bundle</b> is often specified along with the group by referring {{to it as a}} principal G-bundle.
