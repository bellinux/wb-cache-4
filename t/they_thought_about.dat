5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E

Just keep loving old Buck. Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.|$|E
25|$|The Aduatuci and the Germani (in {{the narrow}} sense) {{participated in an}} {{alliance}} of Belgic tribes against Caesar in 57 BCE. Before that battle, information from the Remi, a tribe allied with Rome, stated that the Germani (the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, and the Paemani; but not the Segni) had collectively promised, <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>about</b> 40,000 men. The Aduatuci had promised 19,000. In 54 BCE, after the defeat of this alliance in the Battle of the Sabis, the Eburones and the Aduatuci rebelled again in alliance with the Gaulish tribes to their south and west, the Treveri and Nervii.|$|E

25|$|Caesar's forces {{clashed with}} an {{alliance}} of Belgic tribes in 57 BCE in the Battle of the Sabis. Before that battle, information from the Remi, a tribe allied with Rome, stated that the Germani (the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, and the Paemani) had collectively promised, <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>about</b> 40,000 men. These were to join 60,000 Bellovaci, 50,000 Suessiones, 50,000 Nervii, 15,000 Atrebates, 10,000 Ambiani, 25,000 Morini, 9,000 Menapii, 10,000 Caleti, 10,000 Velocasses, 10,000 Viromandui, and 19,000 Aduatuci. The whole force was led by Galba, king of the Suessiones. However, the alliance did not work. The Suessiones and Bellovaci surrendered after the Romans defended the Remi and then moved towards their lands. And after this the Ambiani offered no further resistance and the Nervii, along with the Atrebates and Viromandui, formed the most important force {{on the day of}} the battle. The Eburones are not mentioned specifically in the description of the battle itself, but after the defeat the Eburones became important as one of the tribes continuing to resist Roman overlordship.|$|E

Akon played her the beat he had developed, and they began working on the song. They wrote it in 10 minutes, {{coming up with a}} doo-wop song rather than the hip hop sound Stefani had expected.|$|E
500|$|When {{the league}} finally {{approved}} Calgary for 2011, the team considered where {{to host the}} game. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> building temporary stadiums west of the city limits or in Lake Louise and hosting the game {{at the foot of}} the Canadian Rockies. The team dismissed the latter idea as impractical, and settled on McMahon Stadium. [...] The usual home of the Calgary Stampeders and the University of Calgary Dinos football teams, McMahon has a standard capacity of 35,650 but additional seating added in the north end zone pushed the capacity for this game over 41,000.|$|E

500|$|All {{three had}} {{previously}} programmed their own video games: Johansson {{had made a}} Mastermind game featuring an opponent character named Thorvald; Kimmo had made a slot machine game and a tic-tac-toe game; and Kann had made a guessing game similar to hangman. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> how they wanted to combine their games into one single amusement arcade-themed game, where the player could pick which of the games they wanted to play, but due to difficulties in unifying the three developers' different programming methods, the game's code became [...] "messy"; Kann eventually {{decided to make a}} [...] "final push" [...] and managed to finish and unify the program.|$|E
500|$|The seminal {{research}} on delayed gratification – the now-famous [...] "marshmallow experiment" [...] – {{was conducted by}} Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: [...] "small reward now, bigger reward later." [...] Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain [...] "cool" [...] distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs, or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} {{first had}} {{to prove that the}} game all worked. They made what's called a [...] "vertical slide" [...] of the game, where they made one movie and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> all the games that would make the actions. Trowers said that they [...] "wanted {{people to be able to}} share movies" [...] and [...] "give people the freedom to do what they wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{test this}} hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger {{movements}} at random intervals, while not counting or planning when {{to make such}} (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. An externally controlled [...] "stop-signal" [...] sound was played at pseudo random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there was an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his [...] "movement genesis" [...] (or else they would have stopped or [...] "vetoed" [...] the movement), and (b) after {{it is too late}} to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.|$|E
2500|$|Once a {{performance}} is over, each judge will give {{an overview of}} what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of [...] "Yes", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated from that series' contest. In Series 8, a new feature {{was added to the}} auditions, which had been previously used on Germany's Got Talent, called the [...] "Golden Buzzer". Situated in the centre of the judge's desk, the Golden Buzzer allows a judge to effectively send the contestant(s) into the live semi-finals, regardless of the opinions of the other judges, if they felt that a contestant's performance was outstanding; when pressed, the judge's X turns gold and the stage is showered in gold glitter strips. However, as a general rule, they may only press it once and cannot press it again in later auditions. While the hosts of Britain's Got Talent may also press the Golden Buzzer for a contestant, they may only press it once themselves in the same manner.|$|E
2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I {{think she was}} very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most. I think she covered a lot [...]" [...] Some said this look into Britney's life was inspiring. [...] "I really have gained {{a lot of respect}} for her now," [...] Derek wrote. [...] "I felt like this was the first time since she burst onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ... I think this is what fans and others have wanted from her for a long time, to be honest. Her honesty can be helpful for others who may be going through situations like hers, such as dealing with a custody battle." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the development, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> how to launch the game, and {{came up with the idea}} to put together fake game boxes for the fictional Arc Symphony, consisting of a PlayStation-style jewel case and JRPG-like cover art with inaccurate Japanese text. A few of these were given out to friends as keepsakes, who would play along with the illusion that the Arc Symphony JRPG was a real video game by posting about it on social media, sharing photographs of the jewel cases on the internet accompanied with comments about the nostalgic feelings they supposedly had for the game. Park said that she liked this idea, since it replicated the game's premise of learning about a game through its fan community in real life. Park and Evans brought the remaining cases to the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, where more people joined in; according to Park, some people insisted that they remembered playing the Arc Symphony JRPG, something she described as feeling surreal. In addition to the case, a fake fan site for the JRPG was created in the style of fan sites from the 1990s; it was coded by Park, and includes fake fan fiction. As she had never been interested in fan fiction herself, she described what she had written as [...] "accurately bad".|$|E
60|$|Of {{the quality}} of their private {{imagination}} I never learnt anything; I suppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was romantic and sentimental. So far as marriage went, the married state seemed at once very attractive and dreadfully serious to them, composed in equal measure of becoming important and becoming old. I don't know what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> children. I doubt if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> them at all. It was very secret if they did.|$|E
