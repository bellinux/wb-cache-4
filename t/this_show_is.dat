500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 8.2 out of 10, commending Chris's storyline and praising Stewie's {{temporary}} build, but criticizing the staleness of Meg's continued poor treatment. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave a much more critical review giving the episode a grade of a C. Heisler stated that neither of the storylines [...] "held any water", because they were [...] "ridiculously short". He also commented: [...] "I'm starting to wonder if <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> even watchable anymore – 18 minutes of filler, 45 seconds of inspired silliness." ...|$|E
500|$|Criticism to {{the episode}} {{was done by}} Finley who said, [...] "So much of <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to an absurd degree {{as he tries to}} impress the actor who's playing him." [...] Similarly, Werts said [...] "Shalhoub pushes a tad too far with the compulsions." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its [...] "excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness." [...] Although praised Shalhoub–Tucci dynamic, Rich Heldenfels of Akron Beacon Journal criticized it as [...] "the actor-imitating-life thing has been done before on TV and in the movies, and the gag well is pretty dry." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune deemed [...] "Dream On" [...] a [...] "highly enjoyable", [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] episode, and possibly her favorite since the pilot. Ryan praised Whedon's directing, writing {{that it is}} clear [...] "Whedon really gets what <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> good at when it's working". Lee Ferguson of CBC also called [...] "Dream On" [...] {{one of his favorite}} episodes of the season, commenting that: [...] "NPH easily outperformed some of the other recent celebs (including Molly Shannon and Olivia Newton-John) who've stopped by the show", and hoped that his character would return in the future.|$|E
500|$|... "Bloodline" [...] aired the {{day after}} Fringes fourth season renewal was {{announced}} by Fox Entertainment, which came {{in the wake of}} various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, [...] "I know so often fans think that they need us... but I would be digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So — thank you. Really." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating [...] "That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is,</b> for me, little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{the biggest}} lie I've ever heard. I'm so angry. We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's {{something you have to}} live with– but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E

500|$|Sava {{felt that}} having the series {{introduce}} the race made Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "an {{essential part of}} Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future", explaining that [...] "the series has {{become more and more}} connected to the larger MCU since Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. deals with the fallout. Not anymore. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an Inhumans movie planned for 2019." [...] Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans [...] "on a personal level rather than a cosmic level" [...] via the television series makes [...] "the whole idea a bit easier to swallow" [...] for the general MCU audience.|$|E
500|$|Ferber was {{at first}} shocked that {{anyone would want to}} adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern {{that he did not want}} to adapt it as the typical {{frivolous}} [...] "girlie" [...] show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, [...] "This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> the opportunity of my life..."Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{with one}} detractor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} his [...] "favorite episode of season seven" [...] and that he wished that [...] "it had been the series finale" [...] for The X-Files. VanDerWerff argued that the episode possessed a [...] "warmth and tenderness" [...] that was missing from the following two seasons, after Duchovny left the series as a full-time star. He concluded that [...] "the genius of 'Je Souhaite' lies in how it embraces the inherent weirdness of the world <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> set in." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Je Souhaite" [...] the second most funny X-Files episode, writing, [...] "Best line: When Scully, ever the skeptic, begins trying to rationalize her examination of an invisible body, Mulder replies with an exasperated, 'Oh!' It's {{what most of us}} had been thinking for years about Scully's refusal to acknowledge all the strange crap she had seen." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{thought that}} Will Arnett, who {{appeared}} as Devon Banks, was [...] "shrewdly cast". Webb Mitovich added that this episode displayed some [...] "good, good stuff". Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad declared [...] "Fireworks" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} episodes so far this season" [...] citing that [...] "the writers juggled a handful of storylines very, very well". She wrote that {{the best part of}} the episodes were [...] "the one-liners. They had [...] laughing so hard that [...] frequently had to pause the TiVo to recover." [...] Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode [...] "was another prime example of what <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> capable of". He thought that [...] "the choice of Arnett as Jack Donaghy's nemesis was perfect, right down to their shared graveled vocal delivery", and that recurring character Chris Parnell's [...] "short, quick hitting scenes are always nonsensical perfection".|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{selected}} [...] "Defying Gravity" [...] for {{the episode}} after Colfer relayed {{a story from}} his own high school days, whereby his drama teacher refused to let him sing the song because of his sex. Murphy explained: [...] "I {{found a way to}} write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is." [...] Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song [...] "really meant the world" [...] to him, and that: [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's {{probably one of the most}} honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about <b>this</b> <b>show</b> <b>is</b> you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
