500|$|Bastard was Somerset's leading wicket-taker {{again in}} 1885, {{claiming}} 25 wickets. In his first {{match for the}} county that summer, he recorded his second ten-wicket match. Facing Hampshire in Taunton, Bastard claimed eight wickets in the first innings, and a further three in the second as Somerset recorded their only win of the year. His next match for the county was also against Hampshire, this time in Southampton. Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, and after batting first reached 117. In the Hampshire response, a contemporary match report recorded that Bastard [...] "did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets {{at a cost of}} only 59 runs". Despite his performance, Hampshire passed Somerset's total and had a first innings lead of 45 runs. Somerset scored 166 in their second innings, leaving Hampshire requiring 122 to win. Bastard bowled 27 overs in the second innings, but failed to add to his wicket tally, and Hampshire won the match by eight wickets. Bastard's performances during 1885 saw him selected in two games for the Gentlemen during the Scarborough Festival. The team was a young one, as well as three of his Oxford team-mates from that season, Page, Kingsmill Key and <b>Tim</b> <b>O'Brien,</b> {{there were a number of}} players from the Cambridge team chosen. Bastard claimed five wickets in the first innings of the match against I Zingari, but failed to take any against the Players. In 1885, his 62 first-class wickets was the eighteenth highest among bowlers in the country.|$|E
500|$|Crossland {{was named}} in the initial twelve-man squad for the first Test against Australia, which was played at Lancashire's Old Trafford ground. An {{official}} from the home ground chose the England team for each match. Lord Harris {{announced that he would}} not participate in the Test at Old Trafford if Crossland was selected. As a result, Lord Harris was withdrawn from the team and replaced by <b>Tim</b> <b>O'Brien,</b> although in the end Crossland did not play either. Lord Harris, who was both the captain of Kent and England in 1884, led the protests against throwing. He forced the retirement of two of Kent's bowlers, but was reasonably satisfied with Lancashire in 1884: for their match against Kent at Old Trafford, they dropped Nash, and by the meeting of the two sides in August that year, neither Crossland nor Nash were in the side. Lord Harris had hoped that this indicated that Lancashire were making efforts to [...] "of [...] own free will, and without agreement with other counties, to place [...] eleven in an irreproachable position", though Lancashire later clarified that Crossland had only missed the match as he was suffering from a shoulder injury; while Nash's bowling was not suited to the hard pitches those matches were played on. Crowd protests against Crossland spread; there was trouble during matches at both Yorkshire and Derbyshire in 1884. Towards the end of that season, the London Truth reported that during a club match in his home town of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Crossland was no balled by an umpire on account of throwing. Upon this, Crossland demanded the umpire retire from the match, and when the opposing captain refused, the match was abandoned. Crossland then announced, via the town crier, that his bowling would [...] "pass unquestioned" [...] in his next county match.|$|E
