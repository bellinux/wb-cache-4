25|$|At Pocono, Earnhardt started {{eighth and}} stayed inside the Top 10 {{most of the}} afternoon. On the last restart, he was behind Brad Keselowski. In a {{reversal}} of the events at Las Vegas, with 5 laps to go, Keselowski tried to move behind the lap down car of Danica Patrick <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of trash off his grille, which caused Earnhardt to slip by and never look back en route to his first victory at Pocono and second of the season. The win marked the first time since 2004 that he had won multiple races in a season. The next week at Michigan, Earnhardt started inside the Top 5, but finished 7th, after several cars had different pit strategies. The next week at Sonoma, saw Earnhardt have his statistical best road course finish, staying in the top ten for most of the race, and finished 3rd.

50|$|Burning the clavie is {{an ancient}} Scottish custom still {{observed}} at Burghead, a fishing village on the Moray Firth. The clavie {{is a collection of}} casks split in two, lit as a bonfire in the evening of 11 January, i.e. New Year's Eve (in Scotland, Hogmanay) by the Julian Calendar. One of these casks is joined together again by a huge nail (Latin clavis; hence the term, it may also be from Scottish Gaelic cliabh, a basket used for holding combustibles). It is then filled with tar, lighted and carried flaming round the village and finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of an altar, locally called the Doorie. It here forms the nucleus of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks. When the burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the people scramble <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lighted <b>piece</b> with which to kindle the New Year's fire on their cottage hearth. The charcoal of the clavie is collected and put in pieces up the cottage chimneys, to keep spirits and witches from coming down.|$|R

Parents speak of the embarrassment of having their child’s instamatic photo in the cashier’s station “rogues gallery” of children not allowed back in the theater for any of a myriad of offenses.

The fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand out <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR MR. DICK,--I {{have been}} a great while owing you a letter; but I am not without excuses, as you have heard. I overworked <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of work {{finished}} before I had my holiday, thinking to enjoy it more; and instead of that, the machinery near hand came sundry in my hands! like Murdie's uniform. However, I am now, I think, in a fair way of recovery; I think I was made, what there is of me, of whipcord and thorn-switches; surely I am tough! But I fancy I shall not overdrive again, or not so long. It is my theory that work is highly beneficial, but that it should, if possible, and certainly for such partially broken-down instruments as the thing I call my body, be taken in batches, with a clear break and breathing space between. I always do vary my work, laying one thing aside to take up another, not merely because I believe it rests the brain, but because I have found it most beneficial to the result. Reading, Bacon says, makes a full man, but what makes me full on any subject is to banish it for a time from all my thoughts. However, what I now propose is, out of every quarter to work two months, and rest the third. I believe I shall get more done, as I generally manage, on my present scheme, to have four months' impotent illness and two of imperfect health--one before, one after, I break down. This, at least, is not an economical division of the year.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{these two}} things are {{primarily}} to be noted in his case. First, that we can only condemn him to a general doom, because we only know his general nature. All criminals, who do particular things for particular reasons (things and reasons which, however criminal, are always comprehensible), have been more and more tried for such separate actions under separate and suitable laws ever since Europe began to become a civilisation--and until the rare and recent re-incursions of barbarism in {{such things as the}} Indeterminate Sentence. Of that I shall speak later; it is enough for this argument to point out the plain facts. It is the plain fact that every savage, every sultan, every outlawed baron, every brigand-chief has always used this instrument of the Indeterminate Sentence, which has been recently offered us as something highly scientific and humane. All these people, in short, being barbarians, have always kept their captives captive until they (the barbarians) chose to think the captives were in a fit frame of mind to come out. It is also the plain fact that all that has been called civilisation or progress, justice or liberty, for nearly three thousand years, has had the general direction of treating even the captive as a free man, in so far as some clear case of some defined crime had to be shown against him. All law has meant allowing the criminal, within some limits or other, to argue with the law: as Job was allowed, or rather challenged, to argue with God. But the criminal is, among civilised men, tried by one law for one crime for a perfectly simple reason: that the motive of the crime, like the meaning of the law, is conceivable to the common intelligence. A man is punished specially as a burglar, and not generally as a bad man, because a man may be a burglar and in many other respects not be a bad man. The act of burglary is punishable because it is intelligible. But when acts are unintelligible, we can only refer them to a general untrustworthiness, and guard against them by a general restraint. If a man breaks into a house <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of bread, we can appeal to his reason in various ways. We can hang him for housebreaking; or again (as has occurred to some daring thinkers) we can give him a piece of bread. But if he breaks in, let us say, to steal the parings of other people's finger nails, then we are in a difficulty: we cannot imagine what he is going to do with them, and therefore cannot easily imagine {{what we are going to}} do with him. If a villain comes in, in cloak and mask, and puts a little arsenic in the soup, we can collar him and say to him distinctly, [...] "You are guilty of Murder; and I will now consult the code of tribal law, under which we live, to see if this practice is not forbidden." [...] But if a man in the same cloak and mask is found at midnight putting a little soda-water in the soup, what can we say? Our charge necessarily becomes a more general one. We can only observe, with a moderation almost amounting to weakness, [...] "You seem to be the sort of person who will do this sort of thing." [...] And then we can lock him up. The principle of the indeterminate sentence is the creation of the indeterminate mind. It does apply to the incomprehensible creature, the lunatic. And it applies to nobody else.|$|E

40|$|My {{inspiration}} for this love seat was the beautiful mountain sunsets we see {{almost every day}} at Liberty University. I love how the dark mountains stand out against the brilliant oranges, pinks, and purples of the sky. I chose to add the curvature of the backrest to resemble {{the rise and fall}} of the mountains. While this is a fun design element it also helps to clearly define the two seats of the chair. I chose not to use legs for this piece of furniture as legs would make it easier for things to roll underneath. From my experience as a college student we tend to drop things a lot, and the harder it is for something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> under <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of furniture the better! As evidenced in the drawing, I have added tables to each arm. Many times college students are looking for a place to sit to work on homework or have a quick bite to eat. Having a table makes it much easier to do either of these things. My fabrics were selected from Mayer Fabrics. The seat and chair back are Fairy Tales Puss ‘N Boots #WC 963 - 004. This fabric corresponds to the curve of the backrest and my idea of mountain inspiration. However, instead of having the pattern run vertically as it does in the examples on the website, I would like it to run horizontally. The arm rests are Silverweave Tangerine. This orange most closely resembled the brilliant orange of the sky at sunset. I thought these two colors and fabrics worked well together to create the design I envisioned. Below are pictures of the fabrics along with links to the website. Drawings of the chair are in separate attachments...|$|R
