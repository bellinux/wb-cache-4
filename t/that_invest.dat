5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

25|$|Exchange-traded funds <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> {{in bonds}} {{are known as}} bond ETFs.

Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E

25|$|Human Capital is the {{backbone}} of Human Development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities, the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, {{and the capacity to}} draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form {{the backbone}} of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> in the human capital and economic advancement of immigrants who are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth. There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).|$|E
25|$|As a {{dioecious}} plant, the inconspicuous pistillate (female) and staminate (male) {{flowers are}} found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles {{developed from the}} axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> the ovary and enclose the fruit. Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs. The ovule is solitary.|$|E

500|$|In {{ecological}} {{terms the}} reproductive {{pattern of the}} American kestrel leans towards a small bird [...] "r-selection" [...] strategy. [...] In r/K selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution {{in one of two}} generalized directions: r- or K-selection. [...] R-selected species are those that place an emphasis on a high growth rate, typically exploiting less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., high r, low K). By contrast, K-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity, and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., low r, high K). Between these two extremes the American kestrel {{is one of the few}} raptor species that lean towards being r-selected. [...] They are able to breed at one year old, have few non-breeding adults in the population, and have larger broods. [...] Their population growth rate is high relative to larger raptors, which typically lean towards being K-selected.|$|E
