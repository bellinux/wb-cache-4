50|$|It is {{normally}} risky {{to change the}} colour of a staple crop because colour preference can negatively affect consumer adoption rates. This {{is not the case}} with yellow cassava. Since local consumers often add palm oil to white cassava flour in their foods, they are normally accustomed to the golden colour. Therefore the yellow colour has been shown not to deter consumers. On a <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> comparing fufu produced with different types of cassava flour, the fufu containing yellow cassava flour was preferred. The experiment also concluded that the yellowness of the fufu added to the appetites of the taste testers.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{evaluation}} of food products {{is a valuable}} means of learning about their characteristics. Consumer taste panels are regularly used to evaluate properties of meat products such as pork loins. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of post-cooking holding time on the <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> ratings of enhanced pork. The loins used in this project were enhanced with varying percentages (close to 10 %) of solutions containing water, salt, phosphates and natural juices or flavors. The loins came from 10 different suppliers and were served in randomly allotted groups of seven, throughout twenty, one-hour <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> sessions. The meat was cooked, diced and kept in double boilers in order to maintain a steady temperature of approximately 122 ° F throughout the duration of the one-hour <b>taste</b> <b>panel.</b> Eight-point hedonic scales were used for juiciness, tenderness, flavor and overall acceptability. The order in which the panelists attended the <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> throughout the hour was recorded. Significant first-degree interactions between time and tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall acceptability were found. As expected, the ratings given by the panelists to the meat decreased as post-cooking holding time in the double boilers increased. Empirically, holding time should be minimized and samples should be replaced after no more than 30 minutes. Results showed that current American Meat Science Association (AMSA) guidelines for meat evaluation should be revised whereby samples are cooked while the <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> is conducted. As such, it is important that proper facilities be used and positive air flow in the panel booths be maintained to minimize any carry-over effects from the aroma of cooking meat...|$|E

Estimates of heritability for hot carcass weight; retail product percentage; fat percentage; bone percentage; rib eye area; kidney, pelvic, and heart fat percentage; adjusted fat thickness; marbling score; Warner-Bratzler shear force; <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> tenderness; <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> juiciness; and <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> flavor that were measured on steers at {{an average age of}} 447 d (weaning age = 185, days on feed = 262) were. 50,. 66,. 58,. 54,. 61,. 48,. 66,. 71,. 26,. 31,. 00, and. 04, respectively. Genetic correlations were positive for heifer weights with hot carcass weight, fat percentage, rib eye area, adjusted fat thickness, marbling score, and Warner-Bratzler shear force, and they were negative with retail product percentage and kidney, pelvic, and heart fat percentage of steers. Age at puberty was genetically correlated with <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> tenderness but not with other carcass traits. Calving rate had positive genetic correlations with fat percentage, rib eye area, adjusted fat thickness, and <b>taste</b> <b>panel</b> flavor, and it had negative genetic correlations with retail product percentage; bone percentage; and kidney, pelvic, and heart fat percentage. Calving difficulty had favorable genetic correlations with hot carcass weight, retail product percentage, and measures of carcass tenderness, but it was unfavorably correlated with traits that involve carcass fatness.
