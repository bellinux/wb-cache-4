[...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the <b>transmission</b> <b>path,</b> possibly even the transmitter.|$|E

A detection algorithm for solar flare induced perturbations on VLF signals was created with the purpose of obtaining the minimum detectable C class flare on these signals.

Performing research on these five <b>transmission</b> <b>paths</b> also enabled analysis on which factors lead to the detectable flare perturbations in the VLF transmissions.
