30|$|In conclusion, ZnO {{nanorods}} {{have successfully}} been synthesized via {{a simple and}} cost-effective spray pyrolysis route. Small addition of <b>thiocarbamide</b> into ZnCl 2 solution (ZnCl 2 :tu = 1 : 0.25) supports development of significantly thinner ZnO nanorods with higher aspect ratio compared to those obtained from only ZnCl 2 solution.

Structural analyses showed that the nanorods arec-axis orientated ZnO wurzite crystals. ZnS particles, issued from the zinc–thiocarbamide complex decomposition being adsorbed onto the freshly formed ZnO side facets, retard the crystal growth to the width thus promoting the longitudinal,c-axis growth.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) is active towards many drugs with a heteroatom having the properties of a soft nucleophile. <b>Thiocarbamides</b> and thiones are S-oxygenated to the sulfenic acid which can either react with glutathione and initiate a redox-cycle or be oxygenated a second time to the unstable sulfinic acid. In this study, we utilized LC-MS/MS to demonstrate that the oxygenation by hFMO of the thioureas under test terminated at the sulfenic acid. With thiones, hFMO catalyzed the second reaction and the sulfinic acid rapidly lost sulfite to form the corresponding imidazole. Thioureas are often pulmonary toxicants in mammals and, as previously reported by our laboratory, are excellent substrates for hFMO 2. This isoform is expressed at high levels in the lung of most mammals, including non-human primates. Genotyping to date indicates that individuals of African (up to 49 %) or Hispanic (2 - 7 %) ancestry have at least one allele for functional hFMO 2 in lung, but not Caucasians nor Asians. In this study the major metabolite formed by hFMO 2 with thioureas from Allergan, Inc. was the sulfenic acid that reacted with glutathione.

40|$|Phenylthiourea (PTU) is {{commonly}} used for inhibiting melanization of zebrafish embryos. In this study, the standard treatment with 0. 2 mM PTU was demonstrated to specifically reduce eye size in larval fish starting at three days post-fertilization. This effect is likely {{the result of a}} reduction in retinal and lens size of PTU-treated eyes and is not related to melanization inhibition. This is because the eye size of tyr, a genetic mutant of tyrosinase whose activity is inhibited in PTU treatment, was not reduced. As PTU contains a <b>thiocarbamide</b> group which is presented in many goitrogens, suppressing thyroid hormone production is a possible mechanism by which PTU treatment may reduce eye size. Despite the fact that thyroxine level was found to be reduced in PTU-treated larvae, thyroid hormone supplements did not rescue the eye size reduction. Instead, treating embryos with six goitrogens, including inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), suggested an alternative possibility. Specifically, three TPO inhibitors, including those that do not possess <b>thiocarbamide,</b> specifically reduced eye size; whereas none of the NIS inhibitors could elicit this effect. These observations indicate that TPO inhibition rather than a general suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis is likely the underlying cause of PTU-induced eye size reduction. Furthermore, the tissue-specific effect of PTU treatment might be mediated by an eye-specific TPO expression. Compared with treatment with other tyrosinase inhibitors or bleaching to remove melanization, PTU treatment remains the most effective approach. Thus, one should use caution when interpreting results that are obtained from PTU-treated embryos...|$|E
