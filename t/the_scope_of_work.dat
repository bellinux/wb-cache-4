In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting bids for the primary construction work on the station, worth $1.525 million. <b>The</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from street level, as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E
5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

But still the work overwhelmed the ACMA. By mid-1907, {{it was clear that the}} UDC would have to completely take over the memorial's fund-raising, design, and construction. On June 19, 1907, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President-General of the UDC, asked the ACMA to delegate its functions to the UDC, with the UDC and Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) retaining certain powers to themselves. The ACMA quickly agreed.|$|E
25|$|Professional diving {{operations}} are usually formally planned {{and the plan}} documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to be done is {{within the scope of}} the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{pursuant}} to the authority provided in the new constitution, the Montana Legislature enacted the Montana Water Use Act (MWUA). The goal of the MWUA was to identify every groundwater source and surface watershed in the state, and to adjudicate every water claim on these sources. The law required that anyone with a water right must file that claim with the state within one year. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) was to administer the MWUA. The DNRC identified five watersheds where water rights most urgently needed adjudication: The Armells Creek, Bighorn River, Powder River, Rosebud Creek, and Tongue River basins. <b>The</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> soon proved overwhelming. In late 1974, based on its preliminary efforts in these five areas, the DNRC estimated {{there were more than}} 500,000 water rights claims in the entire state. The lack of records, overclaiming of water, and amount of conflict over water was so bad, to process all water rights claims would take 100 years.|$|E

5000|$|While the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) {{has always}} {{required}} appraisers to identify <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{needed to produce}} credible results, it became clear {{in recent years that}} appraisers did not fully understand the process for developing this adequately. In formulating <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for a credible appraisal, the concept of a limited versus complete appraisal {{and the use of the}} Departure Rule caused confusion to clients, appraisers, and appraisal reviewers. In order to deal with this, USPAP was updated in 2006 with what came to be known as <b>the</b> <b>Scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> Project. Following this, USPAP eliminated both the Departure Rule and the concept of a limited appraisal, and a new Scope of Work rule was created.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is {{the first}} step in any {{appraisal}} process. Without a strictly defined scope of work, an appraisal's conclusions may not be viable. By defining <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> an appraiser can properly develop a value for a given property for the intended user, and for the intended use of the appraisal. The whole idea of [...] "scope of work" [...] is to provide clear expectations and guidelines for all parties as to what the appraisal report does, and does not, cover; and how much work has gone into it.|$|E
50|$|The {{determination}} of <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{appropriate to the}} needs and expectations of the users of the appraisal results and the intended use of the appraisal drive the {{determination of}} <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and scope of investigation appropriate to the appraisal problem and frame {{the extent to which the}} appraiser investigates the subject of the appraisal and the market. If in the course of investigation, inspection, or research the appraiser discovers evidence which might call particular assumptions into question, he may still have a further decision to make regarding <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Depending on the needs or expectations of the client, the appraiser may choose to continue to investigate the condition to determine its veracity or he may choose to continue to assume the veracity of the assumption despite indications to the contrary, in which case the assumption would be an extraordinary assumption and have to be reported as such.|$|E
