Allen was also beginning to query the quality of British generalship. Godley raised <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> replaced as commander of the NZEF, and proposed Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell, {{the commander of the}} New Zealand Division, as his successor. This never eventuated and Godley remained the commander of the NZEF until its disbandment in late 1919.|$|E

She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her {{dwelling}} in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E

After losing 1â€“0 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal, Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough, joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks, while Sunderland and Hull City survived. Shearer's eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat, and Miller, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} to No. 3, shared century partnerships with Barnes (78) and Bradman (81). A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack, but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century. He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448. The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler, taking 5/91. Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings; another Australian expatriate, Jack Walsh, top-scored with 33. Ring took 5/34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs. Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5/83. After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in {{an hour on the}} final day; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat. Johnson ended with 7/42.|$|E

Others were not interested in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law.

5|$|Lindwall {{returned}} {{to take the}} second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87. The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Lindwall later had Edrich gloving a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145. Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs. On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barneswho had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fieldinghad been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> forced to follow on, and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day, Loxton and wicket-keeper Don Tallon both {{came to the}} crease with Australia in {{difficulty}} at 5/139. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before the gloveman was caught behind from Bill Edrich. Lindwall came to the crease to join Loxton at 6/172 as Australia faced <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> forced to follow on. The pair added a further 36 before Loxton was bowled by Dick Pollard, leaving Australia 7/208, still five runs behind the follow on mark, which they scraped past to end with 221. Loxton again bowled first change in the second innings, taking 0/29 from eight overs as England reached 3/174 {{at the end of}} the third day. Loxton narrowly missed out on a catch when opener Cyril Washbrook had appeared unsettled by some short-pitched bowling from the Australians. A few uncontrolled hook shots flew in the air, and one of these barely evaded Loxton at fine leg. The fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Play began after the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 in the last session, while England required ten wickets for victory. Loxton did not bat as Australia reached 1/92 from 61 overs when the match was finally ended by a series of periodic rain interruptions.|$|E

5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

Lovett accepted the move despite other offers (from the Brisbane Lions and Port Adelaide) to remain in Melbourne with his family and friends whilst having <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> involved in a premiership team.

25|$|Whatever {{residual}} fears many in England {{may have}} felt at <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> ruled by a Scot, James's arrival aroused a mood of high expectation. The twilight years of Elizabeth had been a disappointment; and for a nation troubled {{for so many years}} by the question of succession, the new king was a family man who already had male heirs in the wing. But James's honeymoon was of very short duration; and his initial political actions were to do much to create the rather negative tone which was to turn a successful Scottish king into a disappointing English one. The greatest and most obvious of these was the question of his exact status and title. James intended to be King of Great Britain and Ireland. His first obstacle along this imperial road was the attitude of the English Parliament.|$|E
