Almeida hailed the Emily and after {{making sure it}} was an American ship, let it go. When they were <b>talking,</b> <b>a</b> schooner with 23 guns stopped the Emily again: {{this time it was}} the Almeyda, and Captain Wilson came aboard. This time it was decided that the cargo of sugar, coffee, and leather was Spanish, so Wilson seized them.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the {{committee}} began work, a CD was released that appeared to be a recording of conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party. The recording, related to 2G spectrum scam, would discredit Shanti Bhushan, if found to be genuine. Prashant Bhushan stated that labs had shown the CD was doctored, and that its purpose was to obstruct the anti-corruption movement. Later, Singh claimed that Bhushan telephoned him and tried to stop him from <b>talking,</b> <b>a</b> charge which Bhushan denied.|$|E

25|$|On June 23, 2013, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game {{opened on}} the UK R Albums Chart at number seven, besting {{previous}} album Here I Am (2011) by one chart position. However, on the UK Albums Chart, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game failed to match Here I Ams peak position of forty-three, only managing to debut at number eighty. As a result, it became Rowland's lowest charting album in the UK to date. In the US, <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number four, having sold 68,000copies; it became Rowland's third top-ten album, though sold 9,000copies fewer than Here I Am. <b>Talk</b> <b>a</b> Good Game also debuted at number four on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums, failing to match Here I Ams peak of number one.

And so much of his life is like that." [...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express. Whether it's the kid who's <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> million miles an hour, but saying nothing or the kid who isn't able to get out any word at all they're both at the mercy of not knowing how to express what's inside them." ...|$|E
500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio. He {{found it difficult to}} write a complete song at home, and finished the lyrics later. Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> lot of shit to us to let us feel like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E

Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life.

In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Previously Mitch Albom had {{chronicled the}} Fab Five {{in a book}} {{entitled}} Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream, and Fox Sports had attempted to review the group. The press regarded this as the first complete recounting of the fabled group. Rose describes this film as [...] "almost like the Bible of the Fab Five Story". An ESPN commentator describes the five players as the greatest incoming college basketball recruiting class ever. He notes that they were presented {{to the world as}} the embodiment of what was wrong with college sports because they wore revolutionary baggy shorts and black socks and blasted hip-hop music while <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> lot of trash. The film documents the [...] "formation, rise, scandal and epilogue of the team". It documents the 1991–92 and 1992–93 teams, the University of Michigan basketball scandal, and related off the court issues such as hate mail. Forbes notes that the legacy of the quintet, which includes successive appearances in the championship game of the NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Championship, was overshadowed by the scandal, which necessitated the removal of Final Four banners and vacating of games. The film is noted for presenting the inside story a group of players who the contemporary media derided as thugs and villains, while enterprise rode them as a multimillion-dollar merchandising juggernaut.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the album's {{production}} and style, Harrell stated that {{artists such as}} Rihanna have been <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> stance and stepping away from the popular music {{of the time and}} the expectations of her label, directors and radio, stating, [...] "I don't want to make what everybody else is making. I want to make what I want to make. I know my fans will love it because my fans are loyal to me, but if everybody else loves it, great. If they don't, at least I know, as an artist, I've done what I want to do." [...] Anti was engineered by Nathaniel Alford, Chris Godbey, Harrell, Blake Mares, Daniela Rivera and Marcos Tovar and Harrell.

[...] I think it’s kind of silly {{that it would take}} the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week." [...] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as [...] "TheFacebook", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the Crimson about Facemash, stating that [...] "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many."

2500|$|He {{supports}} U.S. political {{intervention and}} {{economic sanctions against}} state sponsors of terrorism. Santorum views [...] "Islamic-fascism" [...] in Iran {{as the center of}} the [...] "world's conflict", and his geo-political strategy for peace involves the United States promoting [...] "a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq." [...] He sponsored the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 to require Syria cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism. In 2005, Santorum sponsored the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated $10 million aimed at regime change in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the Lautenberg amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like Halliburton to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates. Santorum reflected on his last year in the Senate as one spent <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> lot about Iran, and was characterized by The Atlantic Wire as an [...] "extreme hawk" [...] in his approach with Iran. Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of Hezbollah and the driving force of Hamas. He said Iran {{was at the center of}} [...] "much of the world's conflict" [...] but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006. Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming the nomination of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. Santorum stated that his objection was to Gates' support for talking with Iran and Syria, because it would be an error to talk with radical Islamists.|$|E
