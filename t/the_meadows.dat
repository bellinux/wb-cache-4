5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of <b>the</b> <b>meadows,</b> with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood <b>the</b> <b>meadows</b> are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, and because <b>the</b> <b>Meadows</b> had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some {{have speculated that}} the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges.

5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. <b>The</b> <b>meadows</b> include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on <b>the</b> <b>meadows</b> outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately {{bring an end to the}} civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army {{emerged from}} the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians {{emerged from the}} woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to <b>the</b> <b>meadows</b> beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset.

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on <b>the</b> <b>Meadows,</b> on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E

5|$|The Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster, Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster, is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, <b>the</b> <b>meadows</b> of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{stratigraphy}} and pollen, plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses, {{along with}} nine radiocarbon dates from Nichols <b>Meadow,</b> provides <b>the</b> most intensive investigation of Sierra Nevada montane meadow development and paleoecology. During pollen zone NM-I (ca. 18, 500 [...] 12, 500 yr B. P.) <b>the</b> Nichols <b>Meadow</b> area contained a stream during the Tioga glacial stage. The presence of high Artemisia and Gramineae pollen percentages {{along with a}} very low pollen influx rate reflects a cold-dry steppe-woodland environment. Pollen zone NM-II (ca. 12, 500 - 8800 yr B. P.) documents {{the development of a}} lower montane forest and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) community which existed around a small <b>meadow.</b> <b>The</b> higher sediment accumulation rates suggest that fallen trees contributed to <b>the</b> aggregation of <b>meadow</b> sediments. Early Holocene aridity is recorded in pollen zone NM-III (ca. 8800 - 6000 yr B. P.) by poorly preserved pollen. We infer that the forest rees closed in on <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> and occupied <b>the</b> <b>meadow</b> floor. <b>The</b> reduction in available moisture caused giant sequoia to become locally extinct in <b>the</b> Nichols <b>Meadow</b> area probably moving into their current distribution within the Nelder Grove. Pollen zone NM-IV (6000 yr B.
