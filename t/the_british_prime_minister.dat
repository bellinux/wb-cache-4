5|$|Given {{that the}} Second World War was fuelled {{by the need}} to disarm oppressive and racist regimes, is it fair that the BNP has hijacked Churchill as its own?

5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at Chequers, the official country residence of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> {{where they were}} entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of German {{airborne}} operations during the Battle of France, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5,000 parachute troops.

5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies {{were attempting to}} cut off by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E

5|$|The 1st Airborne Division was an {{airborne}} {{infantry division}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The division was formed in late 1941 during World War II, after <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Winston Churchill, demanded an airborne force, and was initially under command of Major-General Frederick A. M. Browning. The division {{was one of two}} airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, with the other being the 6th Airborne Division, created in May 1943, using former units of the 1st Airborne Division.|$|E
5|$|The second {{hunger strike}} {{took place in}} 1981 and was a {{showdown}} between the prisoners and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Margaret Thatcher. One hunger striker, Bobby Sands, was elected as a Member of Parliament during the strike, prompting media interest from around the world. The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death—including Sands, whose funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000people. The strike radicalised Irish nationalist politics, and was the driving force that enabled Sinn Féin to become a mainstream political party.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the raid against the Bruneval {{installation}} had two important effects. First, a successful raid against German-occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for the British public, and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Winston Churchill took a personal interest in the operation, and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to hear from Major Frost and several other officers {{who had participated in}} it. Several medals were awarded as a result.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule {{could not be}} prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise Rhodesia's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{helping to}} secure victory at El Alamein the 9th Division moved to Gaza in Palestine on 3 December. Since the {{previous}} October, the Australian government {{had sought to}} bring the division back to Australia {{in order to use}} it against the Japanese in the Pacific, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions which had been withdrawn the year before, and on 15 December <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister,</b> Winston Churchill, had finally agreed to provide the necessary shipping. Following a divisional parade at Gaza, the 2/48th Battalion embarked upon the troopship Nieuw Amsterdam on 24 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Beadle's de jure {{recognition}} of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E

5|$|By the 1820s, an {{extensive}} canal system had been constructed, giving {{greater access to}} natural resources and fuel for industries. During the Victorian era, the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by Queen Victoria. Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham and later an MP, and his son Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> {{are two of the}} most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established its own university in 1900.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Sastri was {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Royal Commission on Labour in India.

50|$|Gibson was {{assigned}} to the American Embassy in London in May 1916. In December of that year he supposedly became engaged to be married to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister's</b> 19-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Asquith. Gibson plausibly denied any such engagement in letters to his mother.|$|R
