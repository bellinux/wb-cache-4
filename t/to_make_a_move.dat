5|$|Steph later begins feuding with Summer Shaw (Summer Strallen), who {{was after}} a career in show business, {{everything}} she previously wanted. When Max split up with Steph, she was heartbroken. After a talk they decided they would both give it another go, and Steph asked him to meet her for lunch. Niall made sure Max thought that he and Steph had an affair. This resulted in Max and Steph splitting up once more. They reconciled, but the doubts continued. When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
25|$|A {{player is}} not allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that would return the board to a {{previous}} position, with the same player to move. This rule prevents games from entering into a repeated loop.|$|E

25|$|Earnhardt had the {{dominant}} {{car of the}} race, leading 115 out of 160 laps. On the last restart, he managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> from sixth to {{first place in the}} span of two laps, with Waltrip holding off the field as Earnhardt took the checkered flag. He won the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, which was the first Cup race following the September 11 attacks as the original scheduled race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway was postponed {{until the end of the}} season. After the race, he performed a Polish victory lap while holding a large American flag out the driver's side window.|$|E
25|$|In the race, Harvard {{took the}} early lead {{out of the}} gate with Yale second. Both of the leaders’ strokes were long and slow while Cornell stuck to its stroke. At the half mile mark, Yale edged in front of Harvard but could not hold the lead form a surging Cornell who took a half boat lead {{by the end of the}} first mile. The Courtney-coached crew {{continued}} to build on their lead while Harvard sputtered and fell well behind Yale. Throughout the race, Cornell’s coxswain, Freddie Colson, motivated his teammates by reminding them of what their critic had said about them before the race. About a half mile from the finish, Yale tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> but it was too lateCornell won by 3 lengths.|$|E

Later that day Confederate forces under Major General Bushrod Johnson engaged Brevet Major General Charles Griffin's First Division of the V Corps at the Battle of Lewis's Farm.|$|E

25|$|Confederate General-in-chief Robert E.

On the morning of March 29, 1865, Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to the western end of his line and had begun to form a mobile force of about 10,600 infantry, cavalry and artillery under the command of Major General George Pickett and cavalry commander Major General Fitzhugh Lee. This force would go beyond {{the end of the line}} to protect the key junction at Five Forks from which a Union force could access the remaining open Confederate roads and railroads.|$|E
25|$|Leonard {{also has}} an affair with Raj's younger sister Priya (apparently every time she comes to town), despite a pinky swear with Howard that neither of them would attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> on her, and Raj giving his strong disapproval. When Priya returns, she and Leonard begin a relationship. Raj {{strongly}} opposes this, and Penny is secretly uncomfortable with Leonard dating someone else, eventually breaking down and crying while talking with her friend Amy Farrah Fowler. Once again, Leonard is unaware of Penny's true feelings. Subsequently, Priya pressures Leonard into ending his friendship with Penny, which he attempts with extreme reluctance. Penny complies, though {{it is clear that}} she does not want Leonard out of her life. Penny eventually resolves to stay in Leonard's life by ingratiating herself to Priya.|$|E
25|$|Daei {{became the}} first Asian player to feature in a UEFA Champions League match. Yet at Bayern he found himself low in the pecking order. This coupled with the Iranian {{national}} team's scheduling, Daei had found very little time for playing. Daei was unhappy with his position in the club and decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to Hertha BSC {{before the end of}} his three-year contract, when Bayern won the championship title in the 1999 Bundesliga. He scored his first and second goal in the UEFA Champions League on 22 September 1999 in group stage match against Chelsea won by Hertha with 2–1. His famous match against Chelsea gained him a lot of recognition. Yet even at Hertha he was not a hugely important player, since he was only amongst one of the squad's many successful players, who were to fulfill Hertha's Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League dreams.|$|E

25|$|The dojo has {{a league}} also. Each of the {{students}} competes. The stronger a player is, the fewer games they have to play. Two different time limit rules {{are used in the}} league games. There is a longer time limit where each player has a minute to move, and hayago where the players are given just 10 seconds <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> There is no time limit, so any given player can play 1 or 10 games in one day. The league also has a rating system. The ratings are based on the players' winning percentages. There is a handicap, but one that was very different than the orthodox system of allowing the opponent to place the number of stones to the difference in rank. The stronger player gets 10 seconds less in their time for every number difference in rank. There is also a reverse komi rule. 0 komi, —3 komi, —5 komi, and —8 komi.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines {{were the}} first <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> when John VIII and his advisors made a risky {{decision}} by inciting a rebellion within the Ottoman Empire. In August 1421, they backed a man named Mustafa {{who claimed to be}} a long lost son of Bayezid the Thunderbolt. In Europe, Mustafa's rebellion worked well and he gathered some support. However, in August 1422, Murad II had this rebellion crushed and Mustafa received the traditional execution (hanging) shortly after, something any rebel would have expected. Murad II was enraged and had an army sent to Constantinople and to Thessalonika, the latter falling in 1430. Murad II was unable to take Constantinople by force. Nonetheless, the situation in the Capital was dire enough for Manuel II to come out of retirement and incite yet another rebellion in Asia Minor under Murad II's brother, Kucuk Mustafa. Initial rebel success, including a siege of Bursa was too much for Murad II to ignore so the siege of Constantinople was lifted to deal with this threat, and to the Byzantines' greatest despair, dealt with it indeed.|$|E
