5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
500|$|Following the Åsta {{accident}} on 4 January 2000, when a Class 92 was wrecked and {{taken out of}} service, NSB announced that they would terminate two of the commuter rail services south of Støren towards Oppdal. At the same time, the company announced {{a reduction in the}} number of services from Trondheim to Steinkjer. From 11 June 2000, all services on the Dovre Line south of Støren were terminated, leaving only intercity services. At the same year, plans by local politicians and commerce were launched to halve the travel time between Trondheim and Steinkjer, under the motto [...] "Trondheim to Steinkjer in one hour". NSB hoped to introduce a faster airport link, similar to the Airport Express Train in Oslo, which would allow the trains to operate from Trondheim to the airport in 20 minutes. The plans would have called for the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> at 17 of 21 stations and investments at about NOK3.7 billion.|$|E

"Were it only {{a quarrel}} between Lord Grey and this man, it would matter but little; but, from all I hear, he {{exercises}} a strange influence over his countrymen, who deem {{that he has}} mysterious powers, and can call up spirits to aid him.

But these mountaineers are altogether without learning, and are full of superstitions. Even with us, a man more learned than the commonalty is deemed, by them, to dabble in the black art; and {{it may well be that}} this reputation Glendower has obtained is altogether due to the fact that he has much knowledge, whereas the people have none. However that may be, there is no doubt that the Welsh people are mostly ignorant; and that, at the call of this Glendower, men from all parts are hastening to join his banner.
