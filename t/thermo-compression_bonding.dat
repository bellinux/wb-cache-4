This work reports the highest throughput {{reported in the literature}} for a microfluidic device with simultaneous operation of liquid-liquid droplet generators. The device was achieved by stacking several layers of 128 flow-focusing droplet generators, organized in a circular array. These layers are interconnected via through-holes and fed with designated fractal distribution networks. The proposed layers were milled on poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) sheets and the stack was <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonded</b> to create a three-dimensional device with a high density of generators and an integrated hydraulic manifold. The effect of stacking multiple layers was studied and the results show that fabrication accuracy has a greater impact on the dispersity of the emulsion than the addition of more layers to the stack.

These valves allow one to vary the opening pressure set-point and flow resistance {{over a period of}} time. The first design consists of a micromachined check-valve array using a SU- 8 polymer structural layer deposited {{on the top of a}} gold sacrificial layer. The second design is based on a variable length cantilever beam structure with a gold sacrificial layer. The adjustable cantilever-beam structure is fabricated by gold <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bond</b> of a thin silicon wafer over a glass substrate. In both designs, the evaporated gold can be electrochemically dissolved using a constant DC current via a telemetry link. In the first design the dissolution simply opens up individual outlets, while in the second design, gold anchors are sequentially dissolved hence increasing the effective length of the cantilever beam (reducing the opening pressure). A current density of 35 mA/cm(2) is used to dissolve the gold sacrificial layers. Both gravity and syringe-pump driven flow are used to characterize the valve performance.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{resistance}} welding bonds: solid state, fusion, and reflow braze. In a solid state bond, also called a <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bond,</b> dissimilar materials with dissimilar grain structure, e.g. molybdenum to tungsten, are joined using {{a very short}} heating time, high weld energy, and high force. There is little melting and minimum grain growth, but a definite bond and grain interface. Thus the materials actually bond while still in the solid state. The bonded materials typically exhibit excellent shear and tensile strength, but poor peel strength. In a fusion bond, either similar or dissimilar materials with similar grain structures are heated to the melting point (liquid state) of both. The subsequent cooling and combination of the materials forms a “nugget” alloy of the two materials with larger grain growth. Typically, high weld energies at either short or long weld times, depending on physical characteristics, are used to produce fusion bonds. The bonded materials usually exhibit excellent tensile, peel and shear strengths. In a reflow braze bond, a resistance heating of a low temperature brazing material, such as gold or solder, is used to join either dissimilar materials or widely varied thick/thin material combinations. The brazing material must “wet” to each part and possess a lower melting point than the two workpieces. The resultant bond has definite interfaces with minimum grain growth. Typically the process requires a longer (2 to 100 ms) heating time at low weld energy. The resultant bond exhibits excellent tensile strength, but poor peel and shear strength.|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} the yield of the wafer-level Cu-Cu <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonding</b> method, certain surface pre-treatment methods for Cu are studied {{which can be}} exposed to the atmosphere before bonding. To inhibit re-oxidation under atmospheric conditions, the reduced pure Cu surface is treated by H 2 /Ar plasma, NH 3 plasma and thiol solution, respectively, and is covered by Cu hydride, Cu nitride and a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) accordingly. A pair of the treated wafers is then bonded by the <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonding</b> method, and evaluated by the tensile test. Results show that the bond strengths of the wafers treated by NH 3 plasma and SAM are not sufficient due to the remaining surface protection layers such as Cu nitride and SAMs resulting from the pre-treatment. In contrast, the H 2 /Ar plasma–treated wafer showed the same strength as the one with formic acid vapor treatment, even when exposed to the atmosphere for 30 min. In the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) measurement of the H 2 /Ar plasma–treated Cu sample, the total number of the detected H 2 was 3. 1 times more than the citric acid–treated one.

40|$|More Than Moore's Law" is {{the driving}} {{principle}} for the electronic packaging industry. This principle focuses on system integration instead of transistor density {{in order to achieve}} faster, thinner, and smarter electronic devices at a low cost. A core area of electronics packaging is interconnection technology, which enables ultra-miniaturization and high functional density. Solder bump technology is one of the original, and most common interconnection methods for flip chips. With growing demand for finer pitch and higher number of I/Os, solder bumps have been forced to smaller dimensions and therefore, are subjected to higher current densities. However, the technology is now reaching its fundamental limitations in terms of pitch, processability, and current-handling due to electromigration. Electromigration in solder bumps {{is one of the major}} causes of device failures. It is accelerated by many factors, one of which is current crowding. Current crowding is the non-uniform distribution of current at the interface of the solder bump and under-bump metallurgy, resulting in an increase in local current density and temperature. These factors, along with the formation of intermetallic compounds, can lead to voiding and ultimately failure. Electromigration in solder bumps has prevented pitch-scaling below 180 - 210 microns, producing a shift in the packaging industry to other interconnection approaches, specifically copper pillars with solder. This research aims to explore the electromigration resistance of an adhesive-based copper-to-copper (Cu-Cu) interconnection method without solder, which is <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonded</b> at a low temperature of 180 C. While solder bumps are more susceptible to electromigration, Cu is capable of handling two orders of magnitude higher current density. This makes it an ideal candidate for next generation flip chip interconnections. Using finite element analysis, the current crowding and joule heating effects were evaluated for a 30 micron diameter Cu-Cu interconnection in comparison with two existing flip chip interconnection techniques, Cu pillar with solder and Pb-free solder. A test vehicle (TV) was fabricated for experimental analysis with 760 bumps arranged in an area-array format with a bump diameter of 30 micron. Thermo-mechanical reliability of the test vehicle was validated under thermal cycling from - 55 C to 125 C. The Cu-Cu interconnections were then subjected to high current and temperature stress from 1 E 4 to 1 E 6 amps per square centimeter at a temperature of 130 C. The results establish the high thermo-mechanical reliability and high electromigration resistance of the proposed Cu-Cu interconnection technology.

Void nucleation and growth are studied and counter-measures for void suppression are proposed and implemented. Silicon dioxide wafer bonding, on the other hand, is used as a temporary bond to attach a donor wafer to a handle wafer during donor wafer thinning and subsequent layer transfer. Sufficiently high bond strength is obtained with careful surface preparation and activation prior to bonding. (cont.) Silicon layer can be stacked either in a "face down" or "face up" orientation. Using a combination of wafer bonding and thinning, double-layer stacks in both orientations are fabricated. By repeating these steps on two "face down" double-layer stacks, a four-layer stack is successful demonstrated. A vertically interconnected active layers stack is demonstrated by fabricating poly-silicon resistor chains. Poly-silicon resistors in two layers are electrically connected with interlayer vias. Temperature measurement of metal lines suggests that Cu bonding medium can remove heat from top active layer of a double-layer stack more effectively than oxide bonding medium. Thermal stress induced in a multi-layer stack can pose a serious reliability concern. Analytical and numerical evaluation of thin film stresses of a multi-layer stack is performed. Stresses of interest include normal stress in thin films, and shear and peel stresses at the interfaces. It is found that the Cu bonding layer is under substantial tensile stress that increases with bonding temperature. High stress level in the Cu bonding layer provides a strong driving force for the formation of interfacial voids. by Chuan Seng Tan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The sensor integrates a flip-bonded complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with capacitive sensing circuits on a low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) interposer with Au through vias by Au-Au <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonding.</b> The CMOS circuit and bonding pads on the sensor backside were electrically connected through Au bumps and the LTCC interposer, and the differential capacitive gap was formed by an Au sealing frame. A diaphragm for sensing 3 -axis force was formed in the CMOS substrate. The dimensions of the completed sensor are 2. 5 mm in width, 2. 5 mm in length, and 0. 66 mm in thickness. The fabricated sensor output coded 3 -axis capacitive sensing data according to applied 3 -axis force by three-dimensional (3 D) -printed pins. The measured sensitivity was as high as over 34 Count/mN for normal force and 14 to 15 Count/mN for shear force with small noise, which corresponds to less than 1 mN. The hysteresis and the average cross-sensitivity were also found {{to be less than}} 2 % full scale and 11 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{efficiency}} of Cu surface passivation by optimally chosen ultra-thin layer of Ti resulting low temperature, low pressure CMOS compatible Wafer-on-Wafer (WoW) Cu-Cu <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonding.</b> Ultra-thin Ti layer is {{regarded as one of}} the promising passivation layer as the presence of the same prevents oxidation of copper over an extended period of time. This allows various semiconductor industries dealing with heterogeneous technologies which are geographically located at different places to sync up and carry out 3 D integration through WoW bonding. The optimum thickness for achieving low temperature and low pressure bonding is found to be 3 nm. In this endeavor, efficiency of ultra-thin Ti passivation layer in preventing oxidation of Cu over a long period was analyzed using various characterization techniques. These include contact angle measurements and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The samples got successfully bonded even after their exposure to non-vacuum, ambient conditions and quality of the bonding was characterized using Cross-sectional Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Surface Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) and bond strength analysis by tensile Pull test. The results are similar to the passivated samples bonded just after the deposition indicating that Ti is an ideal candidate for passivating Cu over extended period of time...|$|E

40|$|Infrared (IR) thermal {{emitters}} {{are widely}} used in monitoring applications. For autonomous systems, miniaturized devices with low power consumption are needed. We have designed, fabricated and tested a novel device design, packaged on the wafer level by Al-Al <b>thermo-compression</b> <b>bonding.</b> 80 μm wide Aluminium frames on device and cap wafers were bonded in vacuum at 550 °C, applying a force of 25 kN for 1 hour. The bond force translated to a bond pressure of 39 MPa. Subsequent device operation showed that the seals were hermetic, and that the emitters were encapsulated in an inert atmosphere. The emitters were optimized for radiation at λ= 3. 5 μm. Emission spectra by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy showed high emissivity in the wavelength range 3 – 10 μm at 35 mA driving current and 5. 7 V bias, i. e. 200 mW power consumption. The emitter temperature was around 700 °C. The rise and fall times of the emitters were below 8 and 3 ms, respectively. The low thermal mass indicates that pulsed operation at frequencies around 100 Hz could be realized with about 90 % modulation depth. The measured characteristics were in good agreement with COMSOL simulations. Thus, the presented devices have lower power consumption, {{an order of magnitude}} higher modulation frequency, and a production cost reduced by 40 – 60 % 1 - 4 compared to available, individually packaged devices. The patented device sealing provides through-silicon conductors and enables direct surface mounting of the components. © (2017) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
