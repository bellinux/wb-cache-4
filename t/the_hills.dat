5|$|The more major of {{the current}} roads often started as turnpikes in the 16th century. These avoid the highest areas of <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> To {{the north of the}} western part of the Mendips, the A368 {{separates}} <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> from the Chew Valley, while on the southern edge the A371 similarly runs along the bottom of the scarp slope between <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> and the Somerset Levels. The western end of <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, another serious {{attack was}} made on the British lines of {{communication}} from Ramleh by units of both the Ottoman 16th Division on the plain and the 19th Division in <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> The aim of this counterattack was the destruction of two British Empire divisions in <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> by cutting their lines of communication.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{concerns}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland. <b>The</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland haven’t been archaeologically {{examined and}} they haven’t been studied {{as well as}} hill forts {{in other parts of}} Sweden. The focus of this essay is to determine the use of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland.   Comparative studies will be made between Halland’s <b>hill</b> forts and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts of Bohuslän and <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts of <b>the</b> Eastern part of Sweden. The results of the research have yielded that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland strongly reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän {{when it comes to the}} positioning in the landscape, as well as the general appearance of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts. There are remains of houses in some of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän. Because of the similarities with <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Bohuslän, there is a possibility that there have been houses on top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland. It is not possible to say whether <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland have been places of “safe haven” and/or permanent residents. Most of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland have great view over seas or the ocean, as well as over the inland. They tend to be located close to old roads and would have had a great overview of them. It’s possible that <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts were connected to trading posts. Signaling between <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in <b>the</b> northern part of Halland is possible because of the closeness of them. Drawings of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts have been made successfully; they show roughly where the walls of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> fort are situated and where the precipices and inclinations are situated. The drawings make it easier to compare <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> forts in Halland to hill forts in other parts of Sweden...|$|R
50|$|The {{facilities}} normally {{found at}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> base are {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> at Indianhead. This means that all skiing begins at <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> top, so your last lift ride for the day is up and off <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> There are no accommodations {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> but there are numerous trailside condos, hill top condos, and rental cabins in the area.|$|R

5|$|There {{are still}} several {{quarries}} on the Mendip Hills. Some {{of the stone}} is still carried by Mendip Rail; the other railways in the area closed in the 1960s. Although the Roman Fosse Way crossed <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> the main roads generally avoid the higher areas and run {{along the bottom of}} the scarp slope on the north and south of <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> The western end of <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39. A wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities take place in the Mendips, many based on the particular geology of the area. <b>The</b> <b>hills</b> are recognised as a national centre for caving and cave diving, as well as being popular with climbers, hillwalkers and natural historians. Wookey Hole Caves and some of the caves in Cheddar Gorge are open as show caves; however, many of the caves of the Mendip Hills are only accessible to members of caving clubs. Long distance footpaths include the Mendip Way and Limestone Link.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hill</b> was {{originally}} named <b>the</b> Melaka <b>Hill</b> when Parameswara established <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and surrounding area as the administrative centre of Melaka.

50|$|In 1578, a eunuch of the Qutub Shahi court named Yakut was ill.

The next morning, Yaqut's illness was cured and a stone was found on <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> which is said to have had the hand marks of Ali on it. After hearing about this incident, the Sultan visited <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and ordered a dargah to be built on top of <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>The</b> stone that was found is kept in the shrine on top of <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved around the edge of <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that of the various tunnels that cross under the city of Puebla, one runs from <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> of Loreto to <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> of San Juan (now <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> of La Paz) and from there travels down to <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> Cuexcomate, afterward crossing under the Atoyac river and ending in the Archaeological zone of Cholula and its pyramids.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hill</b> {{itself is}} {{situated}} in the area between Kingswells, Westhill, Blackburn and Dyce.

30|$|The {{formation}} {{ages of the}} grabens are not evident, {{because the}} age of the deformed unit on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> was not determined. However, {{the fact that there is}} no graben extending into Unit A suggests that they are probably older than Unit A, which adjoins and is younger than <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>The</b> domal uplift of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> might result in the graben formation atop <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> (Wöhler et al. 2009).|$|R
5|$|North Korean forces {{began making}} gains in <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> {{along the river}} {{adjacent}} to their bridgehead, against positions of the 34th Infantry.

K Company to the south was also attacked but held its line, reinforced by L Company on August 10. Fighting continued for several days, resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> along the Naktong, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against the other.|$|E

5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E
