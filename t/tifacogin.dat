40|$|Context: The {{expression}} and release of tissue factor {{is a major}} trigger for the activation of coagulation in patients with sepsis. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) forms a complex with tissue factor and blood protease factors leading to inhibition of thrombin generation and fibrin formation. Objectives: To determine if administration of <b>tifacogin</b> (recombinant TFPI) provides mortality benefit in patients with severe sepsis and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and to assess <b>tifacogin</b> safety in severe sepsis, including patients with low INR. Design and Setting: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial conducted from March 21, 2000, through September 27, 2001, in 245 hospitals in 17 countries in North America, Europe, and Israel. Patients: The primary efficacy population consisted of 1754 patients (≥ 18 years) with severe sepsis and a high INR (≥ 1. 2) randomly assigned to intravenous infusion of either <b>tifacogin</b> (0. 025 mg/kg per hour for 96 hours, n= 880) or placebo (arginine citrate buffer, n= 874), and 201 patients with a low INR (< 1. 2) randomly assigned to receive the same dose of either <b>tifacogin</b> or placebo. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause 28 -day mortality. Results: Overall mortality at 28 days in the tifacogin-treated group (n= 880) vs the placebo group (n= 874) for high INR was 34. 2 % vs 33. 9 %, respectively (P=. 88, Pearson χ 2 test; P=. 75, logistic regression model). None of the protocol-specified secondary end points differed between the <b>tifacogin</b> vs placebo groups. An analysis on the first 722 patients demonstrated a mortality rate of 38. 9 % for placebo vs 29. 1 % for <b>tifacogin</b> (P=. 006, Pearson χ 2 test). <b>Tifacogin</b> significantly attenuated prothrombin fragment 1. 2 and thrombin:antithrombin complex levels (P<. 001, 2 -sample t test) in patients with high and low INR. Overall mortality was lower in the <b>tifacogin</b> response in patients with low INR (12 %; n= 83) vs placebo (22. 9 %; n= 118) (P=. 051, Pearson χ 2 test; P=. 03, logistic regression model). There {{was an increase in}} serious adverse events with bleeding in the <b>tifacogin</b> group in both cohorts (6. 5 % <b>tifacogin</b> and 4. 8 % placebo for high INR; 6. 0 % <b>tifacogin</b> and 3. 3 % placebo for low INR). Conclusions: Treatment with <b>tifacogin</b> had no effect on all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and high INR. <b>Tifacogin</b> administration was associated with an increase in risk of bleeding, irrespective of baseline INR...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{effective}} antibiotic therapy, {{about one-third}} of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and organ dysfunction die within a month. This high death rate demonstrates {{the need for additional}} interventions. Both animal models and clinical data suggest that pathological expression of tissue factor (TF), with consequent activation of coagulation and inflammatory processes, contributes to the morbidity and mortality associated with CAP. TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an endogenous molecule with both anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activity. In severe CAP, endogenous TFPI is overwhelmed by increased expression of TF. In this setting administration of recombinant TFPI (<b>tifacogin)</b> could restore hemostasis. The OPTIMIST phase 3 trial of <b>tifacogin</b> in severe sepsis did not show overall mortality benefit from <b>tifacogin.</b> However, retrospective analysis suggested improved survival among <b>tifacogin</b> treated patients who had severe CAP. Benefit seemed clearest when such patients had not received concurrent heparin and/or when they had documented microbial infection. These findings led to a prospective study (CAPTIVATE) in which 2, 100 patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission were randomized to standard care plus either placebo or one of two dose levels of <b>tifacogin.</b> The study excluded concomitant heparin and encouraged documentation of infection. Enrolment was completed in July 2008 but data are not yet available. The primary outcome measure is 28 -day all-cause mortality. In addition to short-term and long-term survival, the study is collecting data on adverse events (particularly when related to bleeding or thrombosis) and the effect of <b>tifacogin</b> on disease progression, resource use, and duration of ICU and hospital stay...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} {{was to determine the}} potential efficacy of recombinant human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (<b>tifacogin)</b> in a subpopulation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from a phase III study of severe sepsis. METHODS : A retrospective review of patients with suspected pneumonia was conducted by an independent clinical evaluation committee (CEC) blinded to treatment assignment. The CEC reanalyzed data from patients enrolled in an international multicenter clinical trial of sepsis who had a diagnosis of pneumonia as the probable source of sepsis. The primary efficacy measure was all-cause 28 -day mortality. RESULTS: Of 847 patients identified on case report forms with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, 780 (92 %) were confirmed by the CEC to have pneumonia. Of confirmed pneumonia cases, 496 (63. 6 %) met the definition for CAP. In the CEC CAP population, the mortality rates of the <b>tifacogin</b> and placebo groups were 70 / 251 (27. 9 %) and 80 / 245 (32. 7 %), respectively. The strongest signals were seen in patients with CAP not receiving concomitant heparin, having microbiologically confirmed infection, or having the combination of documented infection and no heparin. The reduction in mortality in this narrowly defined subgroup when treated with <b>tifacogin</b> compared with placebo was statistically significant (17 / 58 [29. 3 %] with <b>tifacogin</b> and 28 / 54 [51. 9 %] with placebo; unadjusted P value of less than 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Tifacogin</b> administration did not significantly reduce mortality in any severe CAP patient. Exploratory analyses showed an improved survival in patients who did not receive concomitant heparin with microbiologically confirmed infections. These data support the rationale of an ongoing phase III study exploring the potential benefit of <b>tifacogin</b> in severe CAP.

40|$|Patients with community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) {{in the hospital}} setting exhibit markedly abnormal levels of various biomarkers of infection, inflammation and coagulation. CAP is a well characterized disease, relatively homogeneous and amenable to management according to defined protocols. Hence, this group of patients represents an opportunity to investigate further these biomarkers {{as a means of}} determining disease severity and identifying candidates for new therapies. Changes in biomarker levels during the course of disease may enable physicians to identify those patients who are most at risk for deterioration and progression toward severe CAP and who are in greatest need of early intervention. Subgroup analysis of the placebo-controlled OPTIMIST trial of <b>tifacogin</b> in severe sepsis revealed a trend toward benefit in patients with procalcitonin levels of 2 ng/ml or greater and in those with high baseline markers of activated coagulation. Biomarker studies are being undertaken as part of the ongoing CAPTIVATE study. This study includes patients with severe CAP and will compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (<b>tifacogin)</b> versus placebo. In the future it may also be possible to use genomic markers to identify patients at greatest risk for deterioration or complications...|$|E
40|$|Well-documented {{drawbacks}} {{of traditional}} anticoagulants have {{lead to the}} quest for an ideal anticoagulant resulting in a surge of novel anticoagulant molecules. These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO- 14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD 0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG 1, 2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (<b>tifacogin,</b> PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB 402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP 21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin). Direct thrombin inhibitors and Factor X inhibitors are the most clinically advanced. This article discusses the recent advances {{in the development of}} novel targets of anticoagulants. Medline, EMBASE, cochrane database, medscape, SCOPUS, and clinicaltrials. gov were searched using terms "anticoagulants", "blood coagulation inhibitors", "anticoagulants and venous thromboembolism", "anticoagulants and atrial fibrillation", and "′antithrombins.
