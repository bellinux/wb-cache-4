5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people.</b> To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people,</b> and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms-based methods involve {{tracking}} {{one or more}} of {{the three}} primary fertility signs: basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position. Systems relying exclusively on cervical mucus include the Billings Ovulation Method, , the Creighton Model, and the Two-Day Method. Symptothermal methods combine observations of basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and sometimes cervical position. Calendar-based methods rely on tracking a woman's cycle and identifying her fertile window based on the lengths of her cycles. The best known of these methods is the Standard Days Method. The Calendar-Rhythm method is also considered a calendar-based method, though it is not well defined and has many different meanings <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

In their book, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, Tony Rea and John Wright have adopted this more literal translation, translating the term fedayeen as [...] "self-sacrificers".|$|E
500|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{have argued}} that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively {{by the majority of}} people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.

500|$|As Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Ismay had broad responsibilities, and was [...] "concerned {{with every}} aspect of {{planning}} and preparation for a war which seemed imminent." [...] Ismay dealt extensively {{with a variety of}} matters and focussed much of his attention on the preparation of anti-aircraft defences and co-ordination among the military services. As the crisis in Europe escalated, however, Hankey announced his intention to retire in June 1938. Hankey hoped that one person, preferably Ismay, would inherit all of the positions he had occupied, including Secretary of the CID, clerk of the Privy Council, and Secretary to the Cabinet, but the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, decided that the positions should be split and assigned <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

500|$|Regarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: [...] "I like innuendo, I like irony, I {{like the}} way things can be taken on {{different}} levels." [...] This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'. Rooksby interpreted {{the meaning of the}} song in different ways <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people.</b> He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again. For the boys, the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual act as if for the first time.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Lukasz Gottwald (Dr. Luke) {{had just}} {{finished}} producing tracks for Kelly Clarkson's album Breakaway (2004) and was looking to expand further on his writing and producing credits. Luke solicited around <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> {{in the music business}} asking for demos from unknown artists. Two of the demos he received were from Katy Perry and Kesha. He was particularly taken with Kesha's demos which consisted of a self-penned country ballad and trip-hop track. The latter of the demos caught Luke off guard when she ran out of lyrics and started to rap, [...] "I'm a white girl/From the 'Ville/Nashville, bitch. Uhh. Uhhhhh." [...] The improvisation made her stand out from other artists that Luke had listened to, which he recalled: [...] "That's when I was like, 'OK, I like this girl's personality. When you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out." [...] Following this, at the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs.|$|E
500|$|Tolman and {{his assistants}} {{finished}} making their changes in July 1945, and Groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel. Each submitted a written report, which was {{returned with the}} courier and the manuscript. These were busy people who sometimes only had {{a few days or}} even hours to look at the manuscript. Many, but not all, merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it. Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, sent back a detailed review. He had concerns about the amount of credit being given <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> and organizations, and recommended that [...] "full credit be given to H. D. Smyth for preparing it and that the statement be made that the Army has no responsibility for the report except for asking him to do it." [...] Smyth was given credit, but no such statement was issued. To prepare the final draft for the printer, Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington, D.C., from the Manhattan District's headquarters in Oak Ridge.|$|E

500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people...</b> We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special... to know that you had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E
500|$|Yuji Horii, {{a fan of}} {{time travel}} fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the {{scenario}} of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, [...] "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm {{and come up with}} a variety of attractions to put in." [...] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as [...] "a long string of errands... 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'." [...] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an [...] "Active Time Event Logic" [...] system, [...] "where you can move your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you", and with players [...] "talking <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> and steering the conversation in different directions", allowing each scene to [...] "have many permutations." [...] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.|$|E
