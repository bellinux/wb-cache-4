5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> {{measures}} about 1 mm (1/32 in) {{from side}} to side, and is distinctly arcuate (arched) from front to rear, lunate (crescent-moon shaped) in shape, but very wide, with broad and slightly rounded ends. <b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> is solid, dark-brown and has about 10 broad flat ribs only in the middle part of <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> These ribs are absent or scarcely discernible on the side areas. Where the ribs meet the upper edge they sometimes form crenulations ( [...] a scalloped effect) and may also produce {{the same effect on}} the lower edge of <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> In other individuals the ribs extend all the way across <b>the</b> <b>jaw,</b> making both <b>the</b> upper and the cutting edges of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> clearly denticulate (noticeably toothed in outline).|$|R

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> and the shape, size, and position of the bones of <b>the</b> <b>jaws,</b> adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can {{increase the risk of}} failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} a great deal of work on facial animation, there is not much {{research}} on <b>the</b> effect of <b>jaw</b> motion on <b>the</b> movement of the face. The complex nature of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> bones makes it difficult to implement all <b>the</b> motions <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> can do. <b>The</b> human <b>jaw</b> has two widely separated identical joints behaving like a single joint. Widely separated joints of <b>the</b> mandible (lower <b>jaw</b> bone) allow it to translate in any direction and/or rotate about any axis in three-dimensional space although its movements are somewhat restricted by physical constraints and patterns of muscle activity. A simplified jaw model which covers the major movements of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> is proposed in this paper. <b>The</b> lower <b>jaw</b> in <b>the</b> model can rotate around the axis connecting the two ends of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and make small translational motions in any direction in 3 -D space. The face is modeled as a two layer model which is attached to <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> <b>The</b> inner layer of the face moves kinematically as dictated by <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> <b>The</b> outer layer moves with the effect of the springs connecting it to the inner layer. The motion of the outer layer is calculated using spring-mass equations. Eating and chewing actions are simulated as applications of the model. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|Trap-jaw ants of {{the genus}} Odontomachus are {{equipped}} with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom.

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: {{that is to}} say, {{the upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> open before retreating underwater.|$|E
25|$|Laterally compressed, or ziphodont teeth, are {{characteristic}} of Sebecus and other sebecosuchians. Although the teeth vary in size, they are homodont, having a similar shape throughout <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> At <b>the</b> tips of {{the upper and lower}} <b>jaws,</b> <b>the</b> teeth are rounder in cross-section. The fourth dentary tooth is raised in <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> to form an effective canine. The foremost teeth of <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> are much smaller and lower than the fourth tooth. At the tip of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>the</b> first dentary tooth is procumbent, or directed forward. The teeth of the upper and lower jaws form an alternate pattern to allow <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> to close tightly. A notch is present between the maxilla and premaxilla bones of <b>the</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> accommodating <b>the</b> fourth dentary tooth when <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> is closed. <b>The</b> procumbent first dentary teeth fit {{between the first and second}} premaxillary teeth. This close fit allows the serrated edges of the teeth shear with one another.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> joint {{consists}} {{only of the}} squamosal and dentary bones, and <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> {{contains no}} smaller bones {{to the rear of}} the dentary, unlike the therapsid design.|$|R

5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12â14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of life.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. <b>The</b> <b>jaws</b> were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 LÃ¼ {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
