5|$|After Palko, the Court {{examined}} Bill of Rights protections one by one. Despite this incremental approach, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> eventually apply most {{rights to}} the states.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} {{the case would}} be heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge. His court at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, was {{converted}} to accommodate the case by raising {{the height of the}} bench and witness box and installing new seating. In May it was announced that the case would start on 1 June, and that entry to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be by ticket only.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In the event that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> decide that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation {{for the loss of}} the rights.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> {{held that}} <b>the</b> UK has {{constitutional}} instruments that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> not interpret to be abrogated without close scrutiny.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, the Ninth Circuit's {{ruling in}} UMG [...] {{seems to suggest}} that, in future, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> side with <b>the</b> service providers.|$|R
50|$|Even if Mdani {{stands as}} law, it is {{possible}} that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> allow such evidence in the future {{on the basis of their}} power to admit hearsay evidence in certain circumstances.|$|R
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice {{to serve on the}} Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Superior <b>Court</b> {{noted that}} <b>the</b> Act was, [...] "ambiguous {{and open to}} {{disparate}} interpretations." [...] If the Act became law, its meaning and effects {{would probably have been}} determined by court rulings. In this case, to determine the proper meaning of the ambiguous Act, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> have tried to determine the intents of, and state of mind of the enacters of the law, i.e., the voters of the State of Alaska. The neutral ballot summary ( [...] a one-paragraph summary printed on the ballot) may have been a critically important factor <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> have considered in interpreting the meaning of Ballot Measure 4 as law.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> not be of {{much use}} in {{interpreting}} the section, the section was nearly amended in 1992 with the Charlottetown Accord to make it enforceable. The Accord never came into effect.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> {{also found}} that the {{doctrine}} of Ex parte Young did not apply, invoking the rationale of an earlier case, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412 (1988), for the proposition that where Congress had provided a remedial scheme, <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>would</b> not imply <b>the</b> existence of additional remedies.|$|R
5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{size and}} {{membership}} of <b>the</b> Constitutional <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> be restructured. <b>The</b> {{number of members}} of <b>the</b> country's top <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be raised to 17 from 11, and Parliament and the president would elect and appoint members.

25|$|On March 22, 2007, Houdini's grand-nephew (the {{grandson}} {{of his brother}} Theo), George Hardeen, announced that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> be asked to allow exhumation of Houdini's body, to investigate the possibility of Houdini being murdered by spiritualists, as suggested in the biography The Secret Life of Houdini.|$|R
25|$|May 31, 2007: Attorneys for Michael Addison {{stated that}} the New Hampshire Supreme Court should halt all {{proceedings}} due to claims of how <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> handled <b>the</b> death penalty case for Addison.

5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} of the King's Bench was thanks to its use of Chancery-like procedure; centrally, the system of bills. Prior to this, a writ {{would have to be}} issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated time delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was not needed. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the covenant, detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; since the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred there, allowing the King's Bench to issue a bill of arrest on its own.

50|$|Dickson's {{tenure as}} Chief Justice {{coincided with the}} first wave of cases under the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which reached <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> from 1984 onwards.

25|$|One {{suggestion}} is that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> be justified in dispensing with prior notice only in cases of urgency, {{where there is a}} reasonable likelihood of irreparable loss to the application if the debtor is forewarned of the impending application.|$|E
25|$|Cox's {{campaign}} {{appealed the}} judge's {{decision not to}} dismiss the slander charges {{in addition to the}} libel charges. In February 1989 the California Courts of Appeal agreed to hear arguments from attorneys for Cox on why Erhard's slander charges should also be dismissed. Cox felt that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>would</b> issue a ruling dismissing Erhard's slander charges on appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} case setting forth the {{parameters}} of this requirement is Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), in which the Court held that when Congress paid the legal bills for both the plaintiffs and the defendant (in this case the U.S. Treasury department, by designation), then {{there was no real}} controversy between the parties, and a judgment of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> be the equivalent of an advisory opinion.|$|E
25|$|This {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} in certain cases <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> consider if policy changes were justified even when the affected parties had already been consulted.

50|$|Characteristically, {{in those}} jurisdictions a {{non-charitable purpose trust}} {{requires}} a written trust instrument and the trust instrument must specify a protector or enforcer who will have locus standi to enforce {{the terms of the}} trust against the trustees.

50|$|An {{example of}} the {{practical}} effect of the Golsen rule is that if <b>the</b> Tax <b>Court</b> is hearing a case in Dallas, Texas, <b>the</b> Tax <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> follow <b>the</b> precedent of <b>the</b> United States <b>Court</b> of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (which consists of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi).

25|$|The {{previous}} term, the Court had dramatically enlarged {{the activities}} that {{were considered to be}} in or to affect interstate commerce. It had also altered its settled jurisprudence in the area of substantive due process, the doctrine dealing with rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> not {{consider}} {{a case involving}} the FAA for another 17 years. When it did, in Southland Corp. v. Keating, then-Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a 7-2 majority that not only upheld Prima Paint but held that the law applied to arbitration clauses in contracts executed under state law as well. Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor dissented, as they would in subsequent cases where the court upheld that decision.|$|E
25|$|The DEA {{published}} a final denial of Gettman's petition on April 18, 2001. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the agency's decision on May 24, 2002, {{ruling that the}} petitioners were not sufficiently injured to have standing to challenge DEA's determinations in federal court (290 F.3d 430). Since the appeal was dismissed on a technicality, it is unknown what position <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>would</b> have taken {{on the merits of}} the case.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{the case}} does not, on a strict reading, {{constitute}} {{a breach of}} Parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt {{to give effect to}} the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by Lord Diplock in the case of Garland v British Rail Engineering). It {{remains to be seen how}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of Macarthys v Smith, Lord Denning suggested that, should such an event occur, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>would</b> be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.|$|R

50|$|Normally, {{members of}} <b>the</b> new patent <b>court</b> {{must also be}} EU members.
