The <b>thickness</b> <b>ratios</b> of S. planus differ significantly between the two localities, which suggest that these different populations did not frequently migrate between the two areas (currently ~ 130 km apart, although the actual distance during Turonian is uncertain due to the presence of faults and folds between the two areas). There is no difference in hatchling diameters between the two areas, suggesting that the <b>thickness</b> <b>ratios</b> became manifested after the post-hatchling stage due to limited migration with in a nektobenthic habitat. This study suggests that scaphitid ammonoids became nektobenthic with limited migration at a stage earlier than previously thought (not during the transition from normal to abnormal coiling). The limited migration in scaphitid ammonoids might relate to their higher evolutionary volatility...|$|R

50|$|Surface {{distortion}} due to grinding or polishing {{increases with}} the aspect {{ratio of the}} part (diameter to <b>thickness</b> <b>ratio).</b> To a first order, glass strength increases as the cube of the thickness. Thick lenses at 4:1 to 6:1 aspect ratios will flex much less than high aspect ratio parts, such as optical windows, which can have aspect ratios of 15:1 or higher. The combination of surface or wavefront error precision requirements and part aspect ratio drives the degree of back support uniformity required, especially during the higher down pressures and side forces during polishing. Optical working typically involves a degree of randomness that helps greatly in preserving figure-of-revolution surfaces, provided the part is not flexing during the grind/polish process.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of design and {{optimization}} of functionally graded piezoelectric material (FGPM) transducers, wave propagation in FGPM structures has received much attention in the past twenty years. But previous research efforts have been focused essentially on semi-infinite structures and one-dimensional structures, i. e., structures with a finite dimension in only one direction, such as horizontally infinite flat plates and axially infinite hollow cylinders. This paper proposes a double orthogonal polynomial series approach to solving the wave propagation problem in a two-dimensional FGPM structure, namely an FGPM ring with a rectangular cross-section.

50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the die cavity. Due to high length to <b>thickness</b> <b>ratio</b> of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the die cavity. In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the flash material to deformation resistance. As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill the die cavity more effectively - even intricate parts of the die cavity is filled.|$|E
