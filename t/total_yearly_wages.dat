30|$|Our employee-level data provide {{not only}} <b>total</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>wage</b> {{but also its}} {{different}} wage components: basic wage, bonus, supplements, and overtime pay. Bonuses can differ between individuals and {{are based on the}} productivity of workers. Supplements are given to all workers with certain job characteristic, such as those who work night hours or who have more years of tenure in the firm. Information on pay is the <b>yearly</b> <b>total.</b> We divide this <b>yearly</b> <b>total</b> by 12 to construct a monthly pay variable. In comparing wages to the legal minimum wage it is important to use the correct measure of wages. Legally, the wage compared to the minimum wage should include the basic wage plus bonus plus some, but not all, supplements. Overtime pay, the employer contribution to social insurance, and some legally-mandated supplements should be excluded. Other wage supplements that should be excluded when comparing wages to the minimum wage include those for working the night shift and working under dangerous or uncomfortable working conditions. Wage supplements that should be included when comparing wages to the minimum wage are those that are not legally mandated, and include those for medical and health benefits, for tenure, meal allowances, transportation supplements, supplements for books and newspapers, and cost of living adjustments. However, our data only report total supplements paid to workers. That is, we cannot distinguish between supplements that are legally required {{to be included in the}} minimum wage and those legally excluded. Because we cannot distinguish which part of reported supplements should or should not be included when comparing to the minimum wage, when we calculate the proportion of full-time workers earning less than the monthly minimum wage, we present two estimates: the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus (an upper bound) and the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus plus supplements (a lower bound).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study evaluates runoff {{predictions}} {{generated by}} GeoWEPP (Geo-spatial interface to the Water Erosion Prediction Project) and {{a modified version}} of WEPP v 98. 4 for forest soils. Three small (2 to 9 ha) watersheds in the mountains of the interior Northwest were monitored for several years following timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed climate variables, percent ground cover, soil erodibility values, and GIS-derived slope data were used to drive the models. Predictions of <b>total</b> <b>yearly</b> runoff generated by GeoWEPP (WEPP v 2002. 7) and the modified WEPP model were compared to <b>total</b> <b>yearly</b> runoff measured at each watershed. In addition, measured seasonal values were compared to the predictions generated by the modified WEPP model. GeoWEPP significantly underpredicted the <b>total</b> <b>yearly</b> runoff for all three sites. The modified WEPP model, with algorithm changes to account for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow, predicted <b>total</b> <b>yearly</b> runoff for two of the three sites with an index of agreement (d) of 0. 8 and 0. 9 for each. The third site performed less accurately, with d = 0. 3. In the seasonal runoff predictions, the modified WEPP model was most accurate for the spring months (higher runoff) but was a poor predictor for other seasons when the measured runoff rates were low. The GeoWEPP model successfully incorporates digital elevation data, but the WEPP version used to process the data does not adequately represent the hydrological processes of forests. The lateral flow modifications that were added to the WEPP model improved predictions of runoff in forests, thus suggesting that further refinement of these calculations may improve the accuracy of WEPP-based models when applied to forest environments...|$|R
