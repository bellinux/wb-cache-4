40|$|A {{new family}} of <b>tetrathiafulvalenes</b> has been prepared. The {{materials}} exhibit complex redox behaviour {{related to the}} electronic influence of the 1, 4 -dithiin moieties embedded {{within the framework of}} the molecules. The X-ray crystal structure of compound 4 reveals an unusual non-planar conformation of the heterocyclic compound, with the TTF fragment adopting a boat conformation. Theoretical calculations, performed at the DFT level (B 3 P 86 / 6 - 31 G*), confirm the boatlike structure (C- 2 v symmetry) as the most stable conformation for this family of <b>tetrathiafulvalenes.</b> Upon oxidation, electrons are extracted from the whole molecule and the radical cations and dications remain highly distorted from planarity. For the dications, the 1, 4 -dithiin units present foldings of similar to 40 degrees suggesting the possibility of reaching higher oxidation states in agreement with experimental results. For the tetracations, both the TTF nucleus and the 1, 4 -dithiin units are singly-charged and become planar.

40|$|The {{field of}} organic, or molecular, {{electronics}} is currently dominated by both polymeric and molecular organic materials, while considerably less research efforts {{are devoted to}} transition metal based complexes. Despite this, such compounds can offer advantages including additional tuneability of the spatial distribution and energy levels of the frontier orbitals or stable paramagnetic species by manipulating the metal-ligand interactions which may be accomplished selectively modifying the ligand framework or changing the central metal. A series of Ni(II) and Cu(II) acenaphthenequinone bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complexes were prepared and characterised using X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopy, as well as magnetic susceptibility and field effect transistor measurements and computational calculations. The observed charge transport properties are {{discussed in terms of}} the structural and electronic trends both within the series and {{in the context of the}} two more established analogue series, namely the bis(3 -thiosemicarbazonato) and the diacetyl bis(3 -thiosemicarbazonato) metal complexes. The Ni(II) analogues of the acenaphthenequinone bis(thiosemicarbazonato) family were found to exhibit p-type charge transport with mobilities between 10 ¯ 9 and 10 ¯ 5 cm 2 V¯ 1 s¯ 1 depending on the exocyclic substitutent and resulting packing pattern. The observed results were rationalised in terms of the reorganisation energy and the charge transfer integrals. A series of 4, 4 `-phenyl-substituted nickel dithiolene complexes was synthesised and characterised. Initially with the aim of investigating the effect of varying the para-substituent of the phenyl ring on the charge transport properties, these efforts were undermined by the poor processability of these molecules by both vapour and solution phase methods. As a result, n-type charge transport could be observed under ambient conditions only for the phenyl and 4 -bromo-phenyl substituted analogues, but the device performance was extremely poor. Nonetheless, the calculated reorganisation energies, charge transfer integrals and predicted mobilities were encouraging and may prompt further work on these materials. An all-organic analogue series of 4, 4 `-(4 -halogen-phenyl) -substituted <b>tetrathiafulvalenes</b> was also investigated. The hole transport materials displayed mobilities of between 10 ¯ 3 and 10 ¯ 7 cm 2 V¯ 1 s¯ 1 for both solution and vapour processed devices, depending on the nature of the halogen. These results are discussed in terms of their molecular properties and the calculated charge transport parameters and put in context of the performance of the 4, 4 `-bis(phenyl) -substituted benchmark analogue. Interestingly, the obtained crystal structure of the bromo-substituted analogue showed the molecule to be in the cis conformation, an observation that is unprecedented for simple, 4 -phenyl, 5 -hydrogen substituted <b>tetrathiafulvalenes,</b> and indicates that both conformers are initially formed. Finally, a series of 4, 4 `-(2 -alkyl) thienyl substituted nickel dithiolene salts and <b>tetrathiafulvalenes</b> was synthesised and characterised. While the charge transport properties of the former were not further investigated due to the low solubility of the neutral species, the <b>tetrathiafulvalenes</b> were incorporated into FET devices via solution processing. All exhibited comparatively high conductivity at room temperature (1. 6 x 10 ¯ 3 S m¯ 1), exceeding that of their quarterthiophene analogues. This masked the observed gate effects but indicates potential applications as conducting or charge transfer materials. While the two resolved analogues displayed trans geometry in the single crystal structures, powder diffraction and preliminary DSC measurements indicate that the materials displayed at least one additional phase, which once again likely corresponded to the cis conformer...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tetrathiafulvalenes</b> (TTFs) are an {{appealing}} class of organic small molecules {{giving rise to}} some of the highest performing active materials reported for organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Because they can be easily chemically modified, TTF-derivatives are ideal candidates to perform molecule-property correlation studies and, especially, to elucidate the impact of molecular and crystal engineering on device performance. A brief introduction into the state-of-the-art of the field-effect mobility values achieved with TTF derivatives employing different fabrication techniques is provided. Following, structure-performance relationships are discussed, including polymorphism, a phenomenon which is crucial to control for ensuring device reproducibility. It is also shown that chemical modification of TTFs has a strong influence on the electronic structure of these materials, affecting their stability as well as the nature of the generated charge carriers, leading to devices with p-channel, n-channel, or even ambipolar behaviour. TTFs have also shown promise in other applications, such as phototransistors, sensors, or as dopants or components of organic metal charge transfer salts used as source-drain contacts. Overall, TTFs are appealing building blocks in organic electronics, not only because they can be tailored to perform fundamental studies, but also because they offer a wide spectrum of potential applications. <b>Tetrathiafulvalenes</b> are promising active materials in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), in which they exhibit high performances. An overview is provided of the use of this family of materials as a model building block for OFETs to highlight general concepts of organic semiconductors and their use in devices.
