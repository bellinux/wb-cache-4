40|$|Since {{the last}} report, {{and on the}} advice {{received}} in the last meeting, {{the focus of this}} work has now narrowed to examining methods for creating diversity in evolutionary ensembles of neural networks. The three areas that will be examined in the thesis are diversity in local search and global evolution in the EENCL framework, and the investigation of a novel combination of NCL and a multi-objective evolutionary approach. This report details some of the results achieved and publications written since the last report and also details other work that is ongoing. A detailed thesis plan is presented, as well as a <b>timetable</b> <b>to</b> <b>completion.</b> It is expected that the experimental results will be completed within the funded period, but that writing up will overun the funded period by up to three months. 2 Results and developments Our recent results with experiments using an Island model population structure (INCL) are presented in two conference papers in appendix A and B. The first is a paper presented at CEC 06 in Vancouver, detailing the INCL approach. The second is a paper submitted to ICDM 06 and recently rejected, that attempted to expand on the earlier paper with some comparative and analytical work that was unavailable for the CEC paper. The paper was rejected mainly because the comparitiv...|$|E
