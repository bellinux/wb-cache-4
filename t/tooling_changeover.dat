40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{industrial}} problem {{found in a}} company that produces acrylic fibres {{to be used by}} the textile industry. The problem is a particular case of the discrete lot sizing and scheduling problem (DLSP). In this problem, lots of similar products must be generated and sequenced in ten unrelated parallel machines, in order to minimize <b>tool</b> <b>changeovers</b> and the quantity of fibre delivered after the required due date. The company problem is original because a changeover can occur between two lots of the same product due to tool wear. We analyse the problem in detail and present an adaptation of a heuristic found in the literature to solve it. Results obtained with the proposed heuristic are compared with results that used to be obtained by the production planner, using historical data. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The JIT {{workflow}} of Toyota {{had this}} problem of <b>tools</b> <b>changeover</b> took between two and eight hours, Toyota could neither afford the lost production time nor the enormous lot sizes suggested by the economic order quantity. Lot reduction and set up time reduction had actually been ongoing in TPS since 1945 when Taiichi Ohno became manager of the machine shops in Toyota. On {{a trip to the}} US in 1955, Taiichi Ohno observed Danly stamping presses with rapid die change capability. Subsequently, Toyota bought multiple Danly presses for the Motomachi plant. And Toyota started to work on improving the changeover time of their presses. This was known as Quick Die Change, or QDC for short. They developed a structured approach based on a framework from the US World War II Training within Industry (TWI) program, called ECRS - Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Unit-capacity Constrained Permutation Problem with Feasibility Recovery (UCPPFR) {{is to find}} a {{sequence}} of moves for pieces over a set of locations. From a given location, a piece can be moved to a unit capacity location, i. e. the latter location must be free of its original piece. Each piece has a specific type, and in the end every location must contain a piece of a required type. A piece must be handled using a specific tool, thus incurring a setup cost whenever a <b>tool</b> <b>changeover</b> is required. It could be necessary to use some Steiner locations to find a solution, thus incurring a Steiner cost. The aim of the UCPPFR is to find {{a sequence}} of moves with a minimum total setup and Steiner cost. We give a necessary and sufficient condition to check whether an instance admits a solution with no Steiner location. We show that the UCPPFR reduces to finding simultaneously a vertex-disjoint path cover and a shortest common supersequence. Finally, using a compact encoding for solutions and integer linear programming tools, we solve real instances coming from the nuclear power plant fuel renewal problem...|$|R

The thread rolling automation system is designed to function {{as part of a}} multi-process workcell, which emphasizes adaptability and ease of implementation. Design of the thread rolling automation facilitates the development of a universal gripping system, which is designed to grasp a large variety of fastener styles and sizes with a minimum of <b>tooling</b> <b>changeover.</b> A novel grasping model is developed to predict the error tolerance of the proposed gripping system design, which is validated experimentally.

40|$|A rapid {{changeover}} {{capability is}} central for today's thinking concerning responsive, small batch manufacturing. The customer-driven mass customization paradigm places emphasis on satisfying market demands, particularly {{in terms of}} product individualization and ready delivery. Changeover capability is prominent in such a time-based manufacturing environment, where successful companies {{have to be able}} to adapt swiftly to market turbulence and at the same time avoid the traditionally high unit costs associated with custom made or small volume products. Existing <b>tools</b> to improve <b>changeover</b> performance primarily address retrospective improvement, which can be achieved with an emphasis either on refining the activity of those conducting the changeover or changing the hardware that is worked upon. Although there is a choice as to where emphasis might be directed it has been found that retrospective programs are in practice very often led with a strong emphasis on low expenditure and organizational change. Equipment modification opportunities can be significantly undervalued. Beyond retrospective improvement an excellent changeover capability can also be provided at the outset as an element of overall process equipment capability. The OEM's challenge to build and market changeover-capable equipment is potentially greatly assisted by the availability of a coherent design for changeover (DFC) methodology. Drawing lessons from the development of various DFX methodologies, including design for assembly and design for variety, this chapter discusses the early development of a design for changeover methodology to assist OEMs and other groups responsible for the design and adaptation of process hardware...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{production}} {{is a strategy}} for high competiveness in manufacturing. The capability for economical manufacture in small batch sizes is an essential requirement for achieving lean production. This facilitates mixed production of several kinds of products to match varying product demand and can {{have a major impact}} in reducing inventories. An obvious requirement for this is the high frequency of equipment setups or product changeovers. This will not be attractive unless set-up times and costs can be reduced to competitive levels. The application of SMED can achieve this. SMED is a well-established methodology involving a set of techniques, methods and guidelines to achieve fast product changeovers at machines. This paper describes the application of SMED in the production process of plastic and metal components required for the assembly of several types of circuit breakers. The work was carried out during a short period of a few months under a master thesis project. Several important SMED strategies and solutions were implemented and evaluated in terms of their impact on productivity and on other manufacturing performance measures. Three specific machines were involved: a punch-bending machine, a punch press and an injection moulding machine. An important contribution was made by introducing innovative and simple solutions such as adapting <b>tools</b> and normalizing <b>changeover</b> operations. Most of the achieved results exceeded the initial expectations. Beyond the purely technical and economic benefits of SMED, better workstations’ ergonomic conditions were also attained. Besides the usual quantification of setup time reduction, other indicators were calculated, namely: work-in- process (WIP), annual setup cost and distance travelled by operators during the changeover process. Reductions of setup time varying from 59 % to 90 % were achieved. WIP of metal components was reduced from 17. 05 to 7. 74 days reducing more than 50 % on the corresponding costs. A more impressive reduction on WIP was obtained for plastic parts, actually from 5 to 1. 09 days of work corresponding to a WIP cost reduction of over 80 %. The distance travelled by operators during the changeover process was dramatically reduced too: typically a reduction from 300 m to 10 m and less. The total annual cost savings projection, in this small area of parts production, is near 20, 000 €. Although large benefits were obtained from the study, scope for further improvement still exists. In fact the objective of product changeover times below 10 minutes aimed by SMED was not achieved in one case. Universidade do MinhoFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
