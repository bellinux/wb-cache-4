5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound manipulation and <b>tape</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tago Mago is {{the third}} album by the German krautrock band Can, {{originally}} released as a double LP in 1971. It was the band's second studio album {{and the first to}} feature Damo Suzuki after the 1970 departure of previous vocalist Malcolm Mooney. Recorded in a rented castle near Cologne, the album features longer experimental tracks blending funk, avant-garde music, jazz, and electronic <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|With {{some members}} working as dishwashers, {{the group was}} {{apparently}} not thrilled with the album being released on Ward 9. Terry Tolkin, a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent Touch and Go Records in Detroit. Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac was released in 1984. Building on their first EP, the band made psychedelia a much bigger part of their sound on this release, which made full use of the <b>tape</b> <b>editing,</b> non-traditional instrumentation, and sound modulation that came to define their studio recordings.|$|E

25|$|Tape {{recording}} with condenser microphones {{became a}} long used {{standard operating procedure}} in mastering lacquer–aluminium cuts. This improved the overall pickup of high quality sound and enabled <b>tape</b> <b>editing.</b> Over the years there were variations {{in the kinds of}} tape recorders used, such as the width and number of tracks employed, including 35mm magnetic film technology.|$|E
25|$|Rembrandt Pussyhorse {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{experimental}} releases in Butthole Surfers' considerably experimental catalog. Making heavy use of in-studio <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> and sound modulation, the album adds piano, organ, and violin, amongst other sounds, to Butthole Surfers' then-usual battery of electric guitar, bass, and dual drummers. According to guitarist Paul Leary and lead vocalist Gibby Haynes, Butthole Surfers were a four-piece for most of these sessions, with Leary playing the majority of the basslines.|$|E

5000|$|The mono and stereo {{versions}} have {{slightly different}} harmonica introductions. In the stereo version, the harmonica drops out briefly. Also, a noticeably clumsy and audible <b>tape</b> <b>edit</b> is heard {{during the second}} chorus between [...] "And when I ask you to be mine" [...] and [...] "You're gonna say you love me, too".|$|R
500|$|Early {{industrial}} music often featured <b>tape</b> <b>editing,</b> stark percussion and loops distorted to {{the point}} where they had degraded to harsh noise, such as the work of early industrial group Cabaret Voltaire, which Journalist Simon Reynolds described as characterized by [...] "hissing high hats and squelchy snares of rhythm-generator." [...] Carter of Throbbing Gristle invented a device named the [...] "Gristle-izer", played by Christopherson, which comprised a one-octave keyboard and a number of cassette machines triggering various pre-recorded sounds.|$|E
500|$|In New York, Zappa {{increasingly}} used <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> as a compositional tool. A prime example is {{found on the}} double album Uncle Meat (1969), where the track [...] "King Kong" [...] is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts, and because of his insistence on precise tuning and timing, {{he was able to}} augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa. Later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the tempo or meter of the sources. He dubbed this process [...] "xenochrony" [...] (strange synchronizations)—reflecting the Greek [...] "xeno" [...] (alien or strange) and [...] "chronos" [...] (time).|$|E
500|$|By March, {{they had}} {{finished}} recording the track, but {{felt that it}} was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as [...] "a {{hell of a lot of}} work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn't read music …" [...] According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. When it came to recording his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir were also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired, Simpson began {{experimenting with}} <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> and drum {{machines}} and the regular jams {{in the attic}} of his house led to forming the Scratchbeat Masters. Using cut up beats, samples and turntables they would challenge other bands and their sound systems. They released a 12" [...] single called [...] "Wax On The Melt", a collaboration between a number of crews and Graham Massey and Martin Price together with whom he would later form 808 State. Their first album, Newbuild, was released in 1988, but he soon left the group to concentrate on his solo work.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Psychic...s {{tracks were}} {{enhanced}} with extensive <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> and, in some cases, {{the addition of}} non-traditional instrumentation, including the barrage of bizarre sounds (spitting, vomiting, Spanish radio station, etc.) heard in [...] "Lady Sniff." [...] Lead vocalist Gibby Haynes debuted a new vocal technique by singing through a bullhorn for some songs, and played saxophone on [...] "Negro Observer" [...] and [...] "Cowboy Bob". This was the first Butthole Surfers studio album to feature double drummers King Coffey and Teresa Nervosa, and the last with bass player Bill Jolly, who had also performed on the band's first two releases.|$|E

50|$|In June 1969 White Noise {{released}} the groundbreaking album An Electric Storm on Island Records. The album was created {{using a variety}} of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, Love Without Sound, employed sped-up <b>tape</b> <b>edits</b> of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds.|$|R

2500|$|Much of Can's {{music was}} based on free {{improvisation}} and then edited for the studio albums. For example, when preparing a soundtrack, only Irmin Schmidt would view the film and then give {{the rest of the}} band a general description of the scenes they would be scoring. This assisted in the improvised soundtrack being successful {{both inside and outside the}} film's context. Also, the epic [...] "Cutaway" [...] from Unlimited Edition demonstrates how <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> and extensive jamming could be used to create a sound collage that doesn't gel perfectly, and how a track could be constructed from the more inspired moments from extended jams.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the concept}} of art itself {{expanded}} and groups like Survival Research Laboratories, Borbetomagus and Elliott Sharp embraced and extended the most dissonant and least approachable aspects of these musical/spatial concepts. Around the same time, the first postmodern wave of industrial noise music appeared with Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and NON (aka Boyd Rice). These cassette culture releases often featured zany <b>tape</b> <b>editing,</b> stark percussion and repetitive loops distorted {{to the point where}} they may degrade into harsh noise. In the 1970s and 1980s, industrial noise groups like Current 93, Hafler Trio, Throbbing Gristle, Coil, Laibach, Steven Stapleton, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, Smegma, Nurse with Wound, Einstürzende Neubauten, The Haters, and The New Blockaders performed industrial noise music mixing loud metal percussion, guitars, and unconventional [...] "instruments" [...] (such as jackhammers and bones) in elaborate stage performances. These industrial artists experimented with varying degrees of noise production techniques. Interest in the use of shortwave radio also developed at this time, particularly evident in the recordings and live performances of John Duncan. Other postmodern art movements influential to post-industrial noise art are Conceptual Art and the Neo-Dada use of techniques such as assemblage, montage, bricolage, and appropriation. Bands like Test Dept, Clock DVA, Factrix, Autopsia, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Severed Heads, Sutcliffe Jügend, and SPK soon followed.|$|E

Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time.

2500|$|The {{next few}} years saw Can release their most {{acclaimed}} works. While their earlier recordings tended {{to be at least}} loosely based on traditional song structures, on their mid-career albums the band reverted to an extremely fluid improvisational style. The double album Tago Mago (1971) is often seen as a groundbreaking, influential and deeply unconventional record, based on intensely rhythmic jazz-inspired drumming, improvised guitar and keyboard soloing (frequently intertwining each other), <b>tape</b> <b>edits</b> as composition, and Suzuki's idiosyncratic vocalisms. Czukay: [...] "(Tago Mago) was an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return." ...|$|R
