Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored by most of the Indian population. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, Dostana grossed over 871 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.|$|E

5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a <b>two-month</b> <b>period</b> with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a <b>two-month</b> <b>period,</b> and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a <b>two-month</b> <b>period</b> before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Loxton's {{record was}} less spectacular despite playing {{in all but}} one of Victoria’s matches. He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists, and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests. In what was effectively a Test trial, the uncapped all-rounder failed to impress with the bat, making a duck and six. He bowled extensively, sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4/113 as the Australians fell to a defeat. Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition, scoring 53 and taking a total of 4/56 in the next match against New South Wales, which the Victorians won by nine wickets. He then went into an unproductive sequence, failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a <b>two-month</b> <b>period.</b> His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each. Despite this, the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed by what he saw of Loxton at domestic level, and the Victorian all-rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India. With the series already convincingly won 3–0, Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Len Johnson, Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts.|$|E

25|$|Starting Season 6, seasons will {{be reduced}} to <b>two-month</b> <b>periods,</b> a balance Blizzard found from player feedback.

Blizzard anticipates adjusting how skill points are adjusted from regular matches to be less penalizing at the lower skill levels. Players can also be demoted from all tiers above Silver if their skill ranking over the last five matches played drops below the threshold; however, players are still credited {{at the end of the}} season with the highest tier earned that season.|$|R

Based on these calibrations and a comparison with measurements from the longitudinal polarimeter (LPOL) at HERA carried out over a <b>two-months</b> <b>period</b> in 2000, we obtain a mean LPOL/TPOL ratio of 1. 018.

In 2003 he climbed Nanga Parbat, Dhaulagiri (solo) and Broad Peak in a <b>two-month</b> <b>period.</b> The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a crevasse and then developed high altitude pulmonary edema.

40|$|A four-year-and-eight-month-old whippet was {{presented}} with a chronic skin wound situated at the medial aspect of the right elbow. Because of its chronic nature, the wound was initially carefully debrided and subsequently treated by means of negative pressure therapy. This fairly new technique offers {{a wide range of}} advantages that improve the healing capacities of a chronic wound. The beneficial effect of negative pressure wound therapy on the development of a nice granulation bed was clear. In order to optimize the final result, an autologous skin grafting (full-thickness free mesh graft) was performed. By applying negative pressure on the skin graft, a quick and solid attachment of the graft was achieved. After a period of four weeks, the wound was almost completely healed despite various earlier attempts to successfully treat that wound in the <b>two-months</b> <b>period</b> prior to referral...|$|R
