5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius and Réunion were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. On Réunion, it lived alongside <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> ibis, the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> parakeet, <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> swamphen, <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> owl, <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> night heron, and <b>the</b> <b>Réunion</b> pink pigeon.|$|E
