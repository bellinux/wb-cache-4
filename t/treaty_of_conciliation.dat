However, the website of the Holy See presents the pacts as two, making the financial convention an annex of the <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciliation.</b> In this presentation, the pacts {{consisted of two}} documents, {{the first of which}} had four annexes: ...|$|E
50|$|On 23 January 1932 {{the first}} {{definitive}} frontier treaty between Turkey and Iran {{was signed in}} Tehran. The border between Turkey and Iran {{is one of the}} oldest in the world and has stayed more or less the same since the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, and the Treaty of Zuhab. The 1932 treaty thus formalised a centuries-old status quo. On the same day, the countries signed a new Treaty of Friendship, as well as a <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conciliation,</b> Judicial Settlement and Arbitration.|$|E
50|$|In 1563, Catholic troops {{led by the}} Duke of Guise set out to {{recapture}} Orleans, the defence of which was entrusted to the brother of Admiral de Coligny, François de Coligny d'Andelot. On 18 February 1563, when {{the position of the}} besieged had become difficult, Poltrot de Mere, a convicted Protestant, assassinated François de Guise. This assassination precipitated a treaty between the two parties which led to the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563 and established peace between the two communities. Orleans continued to live under this <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciliation</b> until 1567.|$|E
50|$|After World War I, {{the main}} {{priority}} of Luxembourgish foreign policy was {{to assure the}} security of the Grand Duchy in the new organisation of Europe. Situated as it was between the two great military powers of the continent, France and Germany, the country would risk seeing its existence endangered {{in the event of a}} new conflict between its neighbours. The warming of Franco-German relations since the Locarno Conference in 1925 was a positive sign. The Locarno Treaties provided for countries' security to be guaranteed by the development of procedures to resolve international differences peacefully. The Luxembourgish government profited from these dispositions to conclude a number <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciliation</b> and arbitration with other countries. It signed treaties with Belgium and France in 1927; Spain and Poland in 1928; Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia and the United States in 1929; Romania in 1930 and, finally, Italy and Norway in 1932.|$|R
40|$|In my paper, I {{present the}} antecedents <b>of</b> the Hungarian-Italian <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Friendship, <b>Conciliation</b> and Arbitration <b>of</b> 1927. After the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Trianon, Hungary {{tried to find}} allies to broke out of the {{international}} isolation, but was faced with numerous difficulties. While the Bethlen government approached Jugoslavia, Italy offered a possibility for Hungary, {{that could not be}} refused. Finally, the Hungarian leadership accepted the Italians’ offer and the negotiations between the two countries commenced at the end of 1926. Both Italy and Hungary were wary of each other, they tried {{to get to know the}} other’s intentions, but in the end, they arrived at an understanding. After these discussions Bethlen and Mussolini signed a <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Friendship on 5 th April, 1927 in Rome...|$|R
50|$|U.S.-Ethiopian {{relations}} {{were established in}} 1903, after nine days of meetings in Ethiopia between Emperor Menelik II and Robert P. Skinner, an emissary of President Theodore Roosevelt. This first step was augmented with <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> arbitration and <b>conciliation</b> signed at Addis Ababa 26 January 1929. These formal relations included a grant of Most Favored Nation status, and were good up to the Italian occupation in 1935.|$|R
50|$|The Anti-war <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Non-aggression and <b>Conciliation</b> (also {{known as}} Saavedra Lamas Treaty) was an inter-American treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro on October 10, 1933. It was the brain-child of Carlos Saavedra Lamas, who was Argentinian Minister of Foreign Affairs {{at the time}} the treaty was concluded. It was signed by representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay. The US {{government}} acceded to the treaty on August 10, 1934. The treaty went into effect on November 13, 1935. It was registered in League <b>of</b> Nations <b>Treaty</b> Series on November 28, 1935.|$|R
50|$|As a first gesture <b>of</b> <b>conciliation,</b> the Sultan had for {{the first}} time {{appointed}} a Christian Greek, Kostakis Adosidis Pasha, as Governor-General (vali) of the island, and following the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Berlin, Muhtar Pasha was sent to the island for negotiations with the Revolutionary Committee.|$|R
50|$|His work {{in ending}} the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932-1935) {{had not only}} local {{significance}} but generalized international importance as well. When {{he took over the}} foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Nonaggression and <b>Conciliation</b> which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.|$|R
