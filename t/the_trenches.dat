5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|By October 5, Washington {{was almost}} ready to open the first parallel. That night the sappers and miners worked, putting strips of pine on the wet sand to mark the path of <b>the</b> <b>trenches.</b>|$|E
50|$|The banked earth {{on the lip}} of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> facing <b>the</b> {{enemy was}} called the parapet and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was called <b>the</b> parados. The parados {{protected}} the soldier's back from shells falling behind <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> <b>The</b> sides of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> were often revetted with sandbags, wooden frames and wire mesh. The floor of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was usually covered by wooden duckboards. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trench</b> {{was formed}} as soluble limestone, {{dolomite}} and gypsum dissolved forming potholes, funnels and caves that eventually collapsed. Today <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> features many scarps and offsets and generates long rain clouds {{caused by the}} air rising above it. There is a vernal lake in the south-west of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and a stream rising from a drilled well that disappears back into the ground within <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} <b>the</b> Puysegur <b>Trench</b> is highly seismically active, with the Alpine Fault {{starting}} at <b>the</b> <b>trench's</b> northern end. In July 2009, New Zealand's third-largest recorded earthquake (magnitude 7.8) struck {{close to the}} northern end of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> off <b>the</b> coast of Fiordland. A magnitude 7.2 quake hit <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> itself in November 2004.|$|R
5|$|Conditions were {{worst in}} the Allied trenches. The Germans were more willing to accept <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> as {{long-term}} positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} {{deadlock}} as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
50|$|The head of {{the machine}} was 30 ft long and 7 ft wide and 8 ft high and {{weighted}} about 30 tons. The head had a plough blade for cutting the top part of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> {{to a depth of}} about 2 ft, raising the excavated soil and pushing it to the sides of <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> <b>The</b> lower part of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was cut to a depth of 2 ft by a cylindrical cutter superficially resembling the cutting blade of a cylinder lawnmower. Conveyors raised the excavated soil which was added to the plough's deposits at the side of <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> <b>The</b> overall depth of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> was 5 ft and the spoil provided an additional cover of about 2 ft.|$|R
5000|$|Shoring of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> {{has to be}} done not {{necessarily}} immediately after excavation, but within certain time, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> will collapse.|$|R
2500|$|The deepest {{point in}} the ocean is <b>the</b> Mariana <b>Trench,</b> located in <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands.

5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind {{had to make it}} appear that <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|On {{the rest}} of the {{population}} it was far more deadly now; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> â€“ young previously healthy adults.|$|E

40|$|Microstructure in the damascene {{interconnects}} evolves {{with the}} overburden layer, an excessive metal layer over <b>trenches.</b> We present <b>the</b> results of three-dimensional simulation, which show {{the effects of}} overburden thickness on mi-crostructure evolution in a <b>trench.</b> When <b>the</b> thickness of the overburden {{is less than half}} of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> depth, for a <b>trench</b> with <b>the</b> aspect ratio of unity, the microstructure in <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> tends to evolve into a bamboo structure. This effect is discussed in terms of grain sizes in <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and those in the over-burden. The thinner overburden layer would have smaller grains, of which growth is limited by its thickness. Such small-sized grains in the overburden are not likely to grow into <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> which hardly make grain boundaries in <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> Meanwhile, <b>the</b> grains from <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> are able to continue growth inside <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> resulting in a bamboo structure. Overburden thickness af-fects the reliability and the electrical performance of the damascene copper in-terconnects. Optimization of overburden thickness is required to minimize these effects...|$|R
5|$|The Mahdists in <b>the</b> <b>trenches,</b> {{equipped}} with outdated rifles and makeshift ammunition, designed {{to wait until}} Hunter's forces were well within range to open fire. The entrenched Mahdists weathered the continual barrage of the advancing forces until the distance shrunk to one hundred yards. Together, the Mahdist line erupted in rifle fire, hammering the advancing battalions and, in particular, the stationary 10th Sudanese. Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, and a dozen regular soldiers {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were {{to be found in the}} winding alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, looking on as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E

50|$|Ocean bottom seismography {{studies of}} <b>the</b> Ryukyu <b>trench</b> {{provide insight into}} the P-wave {{velocity}} structure of the area. In the northern part of <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> several transects have been studied, including a profile of the back arc region parallel to <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> a transect spanning <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> fore arc and back arc region, and a transect spanning the Ryukyu volcanic arc. The transect perpendicular to the length of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> images many distinct velocity layers. The sedimentary wedge created by subduction has four distinct layers with p-wave velocities of 1.8 km/s, 2.8-2.9 km/s, 3.5 km/s, and 4.5-5 km/s. In the area of this transect, the wedge reaches a thickness of 9 km at 50 km from <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> Beneath <b>the</b> wedge are several seismic layers within the oceanic crust.|$|R
5000|$|As one of <b>the</b> deepest hadal <b>trenches,</b> <b>the</b> sediments of the Horizon Deep {{harbours}} {{a community}} of roundworms. A 2016 {{study found that the}} abundance of individuals in this community is six times greater than it is at a site on <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> edge ( [...] 6250 m) near the deep and that the difference in biomass between these locations is even bigger. Species diversity, on the other hand, is twice as big on <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> slope, probably because of a small number of opportunistic species in <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> [...] Figures for abundance and biomass are similar for the deeps of <b>the</b> Mariana <b>Trench</b> but considerably lower in <b>the</b> Peru-Chile <b>Trench.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} exploration of <b>the</b> <b>Trench</b> occurred in <b>the</b> late 1950s when Robert Fisher, Research Geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, investigated <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> {{as part of a}} worldwide scientific field exploration of the world's ocean floor and sub-oceanic crustal-structure. Bomb-sounding, echo-train analysis and manometer were some of the techniques used to determine the depth of <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> <b>The</b> research contributed {{to an understanding of the}} subduction characteristic of the Pacific margins. Various agencies have explored <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> in <b>the</b> aftermath of the 2004 earthquake, and these explorations have revealed extensive changes in the ocean floor.|$|R
5|$|When {{the leading}} {{squadron}}s charged up to <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and the redoubt, the squadron commander and about 12 troopers of 12th Light Horse Regiment, dismounted to attack with rifle and bayonet, while {{the remainder of}} the regiment continued to gallop passed the redoubt on the right, to ride through a gap in the defensive line. When the second line squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment approached <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and redoubt, most of the squadron continued mounted riding through the gap. However, as both squadron commanders had dismounted to fight in <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> and earthworks, the troopers who continued mounted were led by Captains Robey and Davies. These leading troops stopped to assemble at a point near where the road from Asluj crossed the Wadi Saba, behind the main Ottoman defences. When Robey and Davies mounted troopers were reorganised, they rode along the Asluj road into Beersheba in force, to capture the town.|$|E
