25|$|Other authors {{speculate}} that <b>turacos</b> and other birds employing {{the use of}} turacoverdin may derive a physiological and biochemical benefit from synthesizing the pigment. Copper, like porphyrins, can be damaging to birds when accumulated at high concentrations. <b>Turacos</b> may detoxify {{the high levels of}} copper ingested in a diet rich with porphyrins, thereby advertising the protection they've granted themselves by depositing the copper-rich pigments in their feathers. It also may be of some biological significance that <b>turacos</b> all seem to be pigmented with turacin and turacoverdin in exactly the same regions of the wing feathers.|$|E
25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin, being copper-based pigments, require large {{quantities}} of copper {{in order to be}} manufactured. As <b>turacos</b> are primarily arboreal species, they are able to accumulate copper through a diet rich in fruits, flowers, buds, and other plant matter. Church and Moreau estimated that 3 months' worth of fruit intake contribute to producing the pigment present in the newly grown plumage of the turaco species T. corythaix (the Knysna turaco). It has also been observed that it takes young <b>turacos</b> around a year to acquire their colorful adult plumage, and some authors have speculated that they probably need that long to acquire the necessary copper. It has also been noted that <b>turacos</b> all live across Central Africa, which corresponds geographically with one of the world's richest copperbelts. It is unknown whether turaco diets are especially rich in copper as compared to the diets of other birds, or whether <b>turacos</b> are especially effective at extracting copper from their foods. It is also unknown whether turaco species lacking turacin and turacoverdin-induced pigmentation have a comparatively copper-deficient diet, absorb less copper from their diet, or lack the enzymes required to synthesize the pigments.|$|E
25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin {{are both}} found {{in four of}} the six genera of <b>turacos.</b> The {{subfamily}} Criniferinae is typically regarded as being devoid of the brighter pigments, although the genus Corythaeola does have a small stripe of turacoverdin on its breast. The remaining turaco genera are placed in the subfamily Musophaginae and are referred to as the turacin-bearing <b>turacos.</b> More than half of turaco species belong to the genus Tauraco, and are all notable for being mostly a vivid green.|$|E

25|$|Most feather {{pigments}} are melanins (brown and beige pheomelanins, {{black and}} grey eumelanins) and carotenoids (red, yellow, orange); other pigments occur only in certain taxa â€“ the yellow to red psittacofulvins (found in some parrots) {{and the red}} turacin and green turacoverdin (porphyrin pigments found only in <b>turacos).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} jacana, on {{the other}} hand, {{is a member of}} the order Charadriiformes, a group clearly not closely related to either Musophagidae or Galliformes. This makes it highly unlikely that turacoverdin in Jacana reflects common ancestry with either <b>turacos</b> or galliforms. If the green pigment in Jacana is truly turacoverdin, then the pigment must have evolved independently in this order. This is further supported by the fact that the pigment in Jacana is located only in the remiges, while in all musophagid and galliform species, the pigment is found mainly in body feathers.|$|E

25|$|Turacoverdin is {{a unique}} copper uroporphyrin pigment {{responsible}} for the bright green coloration of several birds of the family Musophagidae, most notably the turaco. It is chemically related to turacin, a red pigment also found almost exclusively in <b>turacos.</b> Turacoverdin {{is one of the}} only true green pigments found in birds, as the coloration that appears in most green feathers is due to the unique properties of blue structural coloration in combination with yellow carotenoids. Turacoverdin and turacin were the first ever chemically characterized feather pigments, and turacoverdin was first isolated and described in 1882 by Dr. C.F.W. Krukenberg.|$|E
25|$|Few studies {{into the}} {{chemical}} nature of turacoverdin {{have been performed}} to date. Research by R.E. Moreau in the 1950s showed it to be less soluble in basic solutions than its chemical cousin turacin. While originally thought to contain little copper by its discoverer, who instead believed it to be iron-based, later spectroscopic analysis demonstrated high copper (and low iron) content in pigment from the green feathers of the Knysna turaco and the Schalow's turaco. Moreau also demonstrated that the green coloration of <b>turacos</b> might actually {{be due to the}} combined effect of two different turacoverdin pigments that differ slightly in polarity.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{spectrophotometric}} {{evidence suggests}} that turacoverdin may be closely related or identical to green pigments in the feathers of the northern jacana (Jacana spinosa), the blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), and the crested wood-partridge (Rollulus rouloul). As Ithaginis and Rollulus {{are members of the}} order Galliformes, this has led some researchers to assume support for a turacoverdin-bearing common ancestor of Musophagidae and Galliformes, making the presence of the pigment a symplesiomorphy for these groups. The pigment data specifically suggests that <b>turacos</b> evolved from a group of galliform species, which is represented by the extant genera Ithaginis and Rollolus. Based on the appearance of its green feathers, researcher Jan Dyck speculates that Rollolus is closer to a possible ancestor than Ithaginis.|$|E

25|$|Although {{no formal}} tests have been {{performed}} investigating the functional significance of turacoverdin coloration, speculation abounds. Moreau in 1958 observed that turaco species inhabiting forests {{are more likely to}} be green in color than species inhabiting other environments, which may offer concealment from predators. In fact, it has been observed that the greener and denser a turaco's forest habitat, the deeper green its plumage, while non-forest-dwelling turaco species tend to be devoid of the green pigment. This claim has not been studied rigorously from a biochemical or phylogenetic perspective, however, and awaits further research. <b>Turacos</b> may employ their unique green coloration for sexual or social advertisement, but again no spectrophotometric or biochemical studies have been conducted to test for sex differences in coloration, and to limited human perception there appears to be none.|$|E

The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species.

60|$|Passing {{on to the}} {{tropical}} regions, it is among their evergreen forests alone that we find whole groups of birds whose ground colour is green. Parrots are very generally green, and in the East we have an extensive group of green fruit-eating pigeons; while the barbets, bee-eaters, <b>turacos,</b> leaf-thrushes (Phyllornis), white-eyes (Zosterops), and many other groups, have so much green in their plumage as to tend greatly to their concealment among the dense foliage. There {{can be no doubt}} that these colours have been acquired as a protection, when we see that in all the temperate regions, where the leaves are deciduous, the ground colour of the great majority of birds, especially on the upper surface, is a rusty brown of various shades, well corresponding with the bark, withered leaves, ferns, and bare thickets among which they live in autumn and winter, and especially in early spring when so many of them build their nests.|$|E
6000|$|This {{principle}} is strikingly {{illustrated by the}} existence of considerable numbers of birds in which both sexes are similarly and brilliantly coloured,--in some cases as brilliantly as the males {{of many of the}} groups above referred to. Such are the extensive families of the kingfishers, the woodpeckers, the toucans, the parrots, the <b>turacos,</b> the hangnests, the starlings, and many other smaller groups, all the species of which are conspicuously or brilliantly coloured, while in all of them the females are either coloured exactly like the males, or, when differently coloured, are equally conspicuous. When searching for some cause for this singular apparent exception to the rule of female protective colouring, I came upon a fact which beautifully explains it; for in all these cases, without exception, the species either nests in holes in the ground or in trees, or builds a domed or covered nest, so as completely to conceal the sitting-bird. We have here a case exactly parallel to that of the butterflies protected by distastefulness, whose females are either exactly like the males, or, if different, are equally conspicuous. We can hardly believe that so exact a parallel should exist between such remote classes of animals, except under the influence of a general law; and, in the need of protection by all defenceless animals, and especially by most female insects and birds, we have such a law, which has been proved to have influenced the colours of a considerable proportion of the animal kingdom.[122] ...|$|E
