5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records {{filed a lawsuit against}} Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made. Stone Temple Pilots had delivered six albums (five studio records and the compilation, <b>Thank</b> <b>You)</b> <b>and</b> Atlantic wanted a seventh album with an option for two more. In a statement made by email, the band said they were surprised and disappointed by the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

500|$|The {{new version}} of the dance single with Inna's vocals was {{initially}} made available for consumption as credited to Bob Taylor and Anni (backwards to Inna), as the artists wanted to [...] "stay in the shade" [...] reportedly because [...] "the Romanian audience has some bias". Following a time of speculation and controversy, the performers of the recording were finally revealed, with Inna writing on her website; [...] "I consider that a good song can be promoted and listened to without knowing by whom it is composed or who interprets it. With the help of 'Déjà Vu', I have showed this thing and, look, again, you – the audience – had the biggest intake. I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> don't forget that you are the only ones that can make a hit out of a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Most other {{movements}} of the mass are parodies of music from earlier cantatas, dating {{back as far as}} 1714. Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to [...] "bring a composition to a higher level of perfection". The original musical sources of several movements are known, for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked. Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and affekt. For example, [...] (We give you thanks) is based on [...] (We thank you, God, we <b>thank</b> <b>you)</b> <b>and</b> the [...] (Crucified) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the faithful Christian, [...] (Weeping, lamenting, worrying, fearing) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of Weimar.|$|E
500|$|Jan C. Snow laments {{that the}} phrase was trite and {{indicative}} of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to [...] "have a relaxing day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not <b>Thank</b> <b>You,</b> <b>and</b> No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I see all of you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. <b>Thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I hope you like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E

That year Le Bon also performed Duran Duran's 1993 hit [...] "Ordinary World" [...] with opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti during a [...] "Children of Bosnia" [...] benefit concert for War Child. Le Bon described the event to Jam! Showbiz thusly: [...] "If you're talking about name dropping, he's one of the biggest names you could drop, Pav-The-Man." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her {{in support of}} the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Pussy Riot themselves tweeted: [...] "DEAR MADONNA! We love you and you just might be changing Russia's history right now. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> a thousand prayers in return!" [...] Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date.|$|E

2500|$|FIFA President Sepp Blatter {{took the}} unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the {{decisions}} that went against them, saying: [...] "Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it." [...] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: [...] "We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting." [...] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> goodbye.

2500|$|The band {{joined with}} long-time Hüsker Dü sound {{engineer}} Lou Giordano to record The Rising Tide, released in June 2000.

At {{the end of the}} tour, the band expressed its desire to finally reach out to its European fans by undertaking its first overseas tour. However, {{on the eve of the}} tour, Time Bomb pulled its tour funding, claiming that they simply could not afford to support the band overseas. It turned out that the label had invested a substantial amount of money in supporting Peter Searcy's Could You Please and <b>Thank</b> <b>You,</b> <b>and</b> the album had performed so poorly that the label was almost completely bankrupt. [...] Not only could they not support Sunny Day Real Estate overseas, they could no longer fund the band at all. Some weeks later, the label ceased operations.

2500|$|Many {{listeners}} associate Klemperer {{with slow}} tempos, but recorded evidence now available on compact disc {{shows that in}} earlier years his tempi could be quite a bit faster; the late recordings give a misleading impression. For example, one of Klemperer's most noted performances was of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Eroica. Eric Grunin's Eroica Project contains tempo data on 363 recordings of the work from 1924–2007, and includes 10 by Klemperer [...] some recorded in the studio, most from broadcasts of live concerts. The earliest Klemperer performance on tape was recorded in concert in Cologne in 1954 (when he was 69 years old); the last was in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1970 (when he was 85). The passing years show a clear trend with respect to tempo: as Klemperer aged, he took slower tempi. In 1954, his first movement lasts 15:18 from beginning to end; in 1970 it lasts 18:41. In 1954 the main tempo of the first movement was about 135 beats per minute, in 1970 it had slowed to about 110 beats per minute. In 1954, the Eroica second movement, [...] "Funeral March", had a timing of 14:35; in 1970, it had slowed to 18:51. Similar slowings {{took place in the}} other movements. Around 1954, Herbert von Karajan flew especially to hear Klemperer conduct a performance of the Eroica, and later he said to him: [...] "I have come only to <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> say that I hope I shall live to conduct the Funeral March as well as you have done".|$|E
