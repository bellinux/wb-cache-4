50|$|In some countries, the {{optically}} pure (S)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its <b>trometamol</b> <b>salt</b> {{is said to}} {{be particularly}} rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.|$|E
5000|$|Tris, or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, or known during medical use as {{tromethamine}} or THAM, is {{an organic}} compound with the formula (HOCH2)3CNH2. It is extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology {{as a component}} of buffer solutions such as in TAE and TBE buffers, especially for solutions of nucleic acids. It contains a primary amine and thus undergoes the reactions associated with typical amines, e.g. condensations with aldehydes. In medicine, tromethamine is occasionally used as a drug, given in intensive care for its properties as a buffer for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis in specific circumstances. Some medications are formulated as the [...] "tromethamine salt" [...] including hemabate (carboprost as <b>trometamol</b> <b>salt),</b> and [...] "ketorolac trometamol".|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of two oral {{forms of}} fosfomycin, tromethamine (<b>trometamol)</b> <b>salt</b> and calcium salt, were studied in five young (age, 29 +/- 3 [standard deviation] years) and eight elderly (age, 72 +/- 6 years) adults. The subjects received a single 40 -mg/kg (body weight) (approximately equal to 3 -g) calcium fosfomycin dose and a 25 -mg/kg (approximately equal to 2 -g) tromethamine fosfomycin dose in fosfomycin acid form. Blood and urine {{samples were collected}} for 24 h. Antibiotic concentrations in serum and urine were measured by microbiological assay. In all subjects, the peak levels of the calcium salt in serum were two- to fourfold {{lower than those of}} the tromethamine salt (6 to 7 and 18 to 22 micrograms/ml, respectively), indicating poor intestinal absorption of the calcium form. The elimination half-life of the two oral forms was about 5 h in young adults, and the half-life was only moderately longer in elderly subjects, with large individual variations: 8. 28 +/- 5. 51 h for tromethamine fosfomycin and 11. 80 +/- 6. 86 h for calcium fosfomycin. In elderly subjects, absorption of the tromethamine salt form was not modified, but the time to peak level was delayed for the calcium salt (2. 58 +/- 0. 54 h versus 1. 41 +/- 0. 67 h in young adults). Pharmacokinetic elimination of the two forms of fosfomycin was only moderately affected in elderly subjects; we observed lower urinary elimination, about 58 versus 28 % of the dose in 24 -h urines for the tromethamine salt and decreased renal clearance of both forms. However, the dosages of tromethamine and calcium fosfomycin need not be adjusted for elderly subjects who have endogenous creatinine clearances above 50 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are crystalline solids in their pure forms. Crystalline solids have definable morphologies, i. e. shape and size. Crystal morphology {{is determined by}} both the internal structure of the crystals and external factors during growth from solution. The morphology of a crystal batch can affect key processes during manufacturing. Companies generally accept whatever morphology the manufacturing process provides and deal with any subsequent problems by costly trouble‒shooting. Rational design of optimised morphologies for crystalline pharmaceutical solids {{would be a very}} significant technical and commercial advance. Chapter one introduces the concept of crystal nucleation and growth. The phenomenon of polymorphism alongside the causes and impact is discussed. A summary of the scope of instrumentation used in the investigation of crystal polymorphism and morphology, including crystal size distribution (CSD), is also included. Chapter two examines the research carried out during an exploration of the optimum crystallisation parameters of phenacetin. Following a morphological study, the impact this induces on particle density and flow properties is examined. The impact of impurities on the crystallisation properties of phenacetin is investigated. Significantly, the location of impurities within individual crystals is also studied. The third chapter describes an industrial collaboration looking at the resolution and polymorphic study of <b>trometamol</b> and lysine <b>salts</b> of ketoprofen and 2 ‒phenylpropionic acid (2 ‒PPA). Chapter four incorporates a solid state study on three separate compounds: 2 ‒chloro‒ 4 ‒nitroaniline, 4 ‒hydroxy‒N‒phenylbenzenesulfonamide and N‒acetyl‒D‒glucosamine‒ 6 ‒O‒sulfate. 2 ‒Chloro‒ 4 ‒nitroaniline and 4 ‒hydroxy‒N‒phenylbenzenesulfonamide both produced interesting, extreme morphologies which warranted further investigation as part of a collaborative study. Following a summarisation of results in chapter five, chapter six contains the full experimental details, incorporating spectral and other analytical data for all compounds synthesised {{during the course of the}} research...|$|R
