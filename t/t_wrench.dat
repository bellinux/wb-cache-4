50|$|In 1941 {{he formed}} with H. J. Massingham and Gerald Wallop, Lord Lymington the Kinship in Husbandry, {{a group of}} a dozen men with an {{interest}} in rural revival. It was a precursor organisation of the Soil Association, which was set up in 1946. Original members were: Adrian Bell, Edmund Blunden, Arthur Bryant, J. E. Hosking, Douglas Kennedy, Philip Mairet, Lord Northbourne, Robert Payne and C. Henry Warren. The group first met in Edmund Blunden's rooms at Merton College, Oxford, in September 1941. They drew ideas from agricultural experts: Albert Howard, Robert McCarrison, George Stapledon and G. <b>T.</b> <b>Wrench.</b> Other members included Laurence Easterbrook and Jorian Jenks. In official eyes, this grouping or think-tank was treated with less suspicion than its correlated far-right political organisations. It had some effect on agricultural policy, particularly in relation to self-sufficiency. It also affected the thinking of the Rural Reconstruction Association founded in 1935 by Montague Fordham, and the Biodynamic Association.|$|E
40|$|The cottage {{economy and}} the {{collective}} farm are two alternative models of socialist agriculture that relate broadly to the traditions of Romantic and utilitarian socialism and embody diametrically opposed attitudes to food and its production. In the decades following the Russian Revolution of 1917 – {{at a time when}} collectivised agriculture was being implemented on a previously unimaginable scale, with disastrous consequences – the case for such a model was made enthusiastically by British Stalinists such as George Bernard Shaw, Jean Beauchamp, Margaret Cole, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. This fed into a wider shift in British society where responsibility for securing the food supply was increasingly seen {{as a function of the}} state rather than the market. During the inter-war decades the centre of gravity for British socialists’ thinking about food production shifted from the cottage economy to the collective farm. Yet there were those – like Chesterton, Belloc, Orwell and Muggeridge, as well as the emerging thinkers of the organic movement like Louise Howard and G. <b>T.</b> <b>Wrench</b> – who in various ways held on to the cottage economy ideal and the peasant smallholder as a bulwark against the vast, industrialised mega-farms of the Soviet Empire. They were often seen not as socialists but as cranks. This paper explores the debates around this issue and considers their continuing relevance to our own thinking about the ways food is produced...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a microinfiltração da {{interface}} pilar/implante de implantes hexágono externo (HE) com diferentes torques. Para isso, foram utilizados nove implantes HE torque externo, pilar cônico e seu respectivo parafuso, selecionados aleatoriamente e divididos em três grupos. Utilizados em duas fases do experimento. Uma suspenção bacteriana de Escherichia coli à densidade padrão de 0, 5 McFarland foi preparada e inoculada nas partes internas dos implantes sendo esses acompanhados a cada 24 horas durante 14 dias. Ao final deste período, a viabilidade bacteriana foi verificada por teste microbiológico. Na primeira fase do experimento os grupos foram divididos em V 0, 5 : composto por implantes inoculados com volume de 0, 5 &# 956;L; V 1, 0 : implantes inoculados com 1, 0 &# 956;L e V 1, 5 : implantes inoculados com 1, 5 &# 956;L. Tendo seus pilares apertados com torque recomendado pelo fabricante. Na segunda fase, o experimento foi repetido três vezes para verificação de reprodutibilidade. Os conjuntos foram divididos em grupos com diferentes torques: T 10 : pilares apertados com torque de 10 Ncm; T 20 : apertados com 20 Ncm e T 32 : apertados com 32 Ncm. Na primeira fase V 1, 0 e V 1, 5 apresentaram todas as amostras com turbidez dos tubos de controle de extravazamento nas primeiras 24 horas. Na segunda fase três amostras apresentaram resultados positivos para microinfiltração, sendo duas do T 10 e uma do T 20 durante período 14 dias. Após este período todas as amostras apresentaram viabilidade da suspensão inoculada. Dentro das limitações deste estudo, pode-se concluir que o torque influenciou na microinfiltração bacteriológica de implantes HE e que a padronização da metodologia apresentou minimização de falhas relacionadas ao operador. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the microleakage of abutment/implant interface (A/I) in external hexagon implants (HE) with different torques values. Nine HE implants extern torque with conical abutments and screws were randomly selected and divided into three groups: V 0. 5, V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 and used in two experimental steps. A Escherichia coli bacterial suspension (BS) was prepared to the density of 0, 5 McFarland standard and inoculated in the inner parts of the implants. The clarity of the broth was observed each 24 hours during 14 days, and after this period, the bacterial viability was checked by a microbiological test. In the first step, implants were inoculated as follows: V 0. 5 - with 0. 5 &# 956;L of BS; V 1. 0 - with 1. 0 &# 956;L of BS; and V 1. 5 - with 1. 5 &# 956;L of BS. Then the abutments were wrench following the manufacturer s recommended torque values. In the second step, the experiment design was repeated three times for checking the reproducibility and the assemblies were divided into three groups with different torques values: T 10 - abutments wrench with 10 Ncm; <b>T</b> 20 - <b>wrench</b> with 20 Ncm and <b>T</b> 32 - <b>wrench</b> with 32 Ncm. The results showed that in the first step all the samples of V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 groups presented cloudy broth on the control tubes in the first 24 hours. In the second step, three samples presented positive results for bacterial leakage during the period of 14 days, which two were from the T 10 group and one from the T 20 group. After this period all the samples presented viability for the bacterial test. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the torque value influenced the HE implants bacterial microleakage and that the standardization of the test methodology offered lower operator variables...|$|R
