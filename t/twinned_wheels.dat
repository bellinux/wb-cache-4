5000|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} Ar 232 was the landing gear. Normal operations from prepared runways used a tricycle gear — a then-novel feature for German military aircraft—but the sideways-retracting main gear's lever-action lower oleo-strut suspended arm - carrying the main gear's wheel/tire unit at the bottoms of the maingears' struts could [...] "break", or kneel, after landing to place the fuselage closer {{to the ground and}} thereby reduce the ramp angle. An additional set of eleven smaller, non-retractable <b>twinned</b> <b>wheels</b> per side, mounted along the ventral centreline of the fuselage from just behind the semi-retractable nosewheel aftwards to just forward of the wing's trailing edge, supported the aircraft once the main landing gear's lever-action lower arm had [...] "knelt", or could be used for additional support when landing on soft or rough airfields. The aircraft was intended to be capable of taxiing at low speeds on its row of small wheels, thus being able to negotiate small obstacles such as ditches up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in width. The appearance of the row of small wheels led to the nickname [...] "millipede". In flight, the main legs fully retracted inwards into the wings, while the fixed support wheels remained exposed and the nose wheel only semi-retracted, with the nosewheel tire's lowest point while retracted never going above the lowest point of the 22 auxiliary centre-line wheels' tires.|$|E
5000|$|The Ju 288's {{intricate}} main {{landing gear}} system's design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members directly behind a single oleo strut, for each pair of <b>twinned</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted to {{the lower end of}} the uniquely-attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off {{the lower end of the}} twin-member, [...] "Y-shaped" [...] retraction strut assembly, and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a rearwards direction during retraction of the maingear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help [...] "shorten" [...] its stowed length within the engine nacelle. This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut's freely-moving top end to physically rotate downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main [...] "Y-shaped" [...] member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end anchored to the firewall's rear surface. [...] The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180º from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels' axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut's pivot point when fully retracted. Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288's main gear units to repeatedly collapse on touchdown.|$|E

40|$|Truemper {{configurations}} (thetas, pyramids, prisms, and wheels) {{have played}} an important role in the study of complex hereditary graph classes (e. g. the class of perfect graphs and the class of even-hole-free graphs), appearing both as excluded configurations, and as configurations around which graphs can be decomposed. In this paper, we study the structure of graphs that contain (as induced subgraphs) no Truemper configurations other than (possibly) universal <b>wheels</b> and <b>twin</b> <b>wheels.</b> We also study several subclasses of this class. We use our structural results to analyze the complexity of the recognition, maximum weight clique, maximum weight stable set, and optimal vertex coloring problems for these classes.

50|$|During development, the {{anticipated}} {{weight of the}} He 177 increased so much that a main undercarriage design sufficient to handle the 32 MT loaded weight, was difficult to achieve. The engine nacelles and wings had little room for the main undercarriage members, which needed to be longer than usual, for ground clearance for the large diameter four-blade propellers. After several extremely complex arrangements had been considered during initial design, a novel system was adopted. Instead of a wheel leg under each engine nacelle, two wheel legs were attached to the main spar at each nacelle, the outboard legs retracting upward and outward into shallow wing wells and the inboard legs swinging upward and inward into similar wells in the wing roots, with all units enclosed by flush fitting wheel and strut doors, which almost met under each engine nacelle when fully extended. During the retraction cycle, the forward-oriented lever-action lower gear strut sections, on which the wheels were mounted onto their axles, pivoted to a 90° angle from 120° when fully extended to the main gear leg, {{to be able to}} fit into the wheel wells. A conventional rearwards-retracting single-leg <b>twin</b> <b>wheel</b> arrangement for each main gear was used on the two prototypes built (one during the war, one post-war) of the He 274 in France. Drawings were made for a tricycle gear arrangement for the Amerika Bomber entry version of the proposed He 277, which was also depicted with single main gear struts with <b>twin</b> <b>wheels.</b> For the He 177A's own landing gear maintenance needs, some two hours were required just to change a main gear tire, using special Heinkel-designed 12 MT capacity main gear jacks and blocks.|$|R
