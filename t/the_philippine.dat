5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, <b>the</b> <b>Philippine</b> crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that <b>the</b> <b>Philippine</b> crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that <b>the</b> <b>Philippine</b> crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within <b>the</b> <b>Philippine</b> crocodile. Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of <b>the</b> <b>Philippine</b> crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E
