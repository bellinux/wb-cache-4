5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
25|$|It has a five-round {{detachable}} box magazine {{which is}} positioned {{just ahead of}} the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Squared off {{the front}} of the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> so that one could use finger support for easier aiming.|$|E
50|$|Other {{devices such}} as inhalers, {{crossbows}} and power tools may also have <b>trigger</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used for all major parts of the pistol {{including}} the frame, slide and barrel. The pistol was offered in four models: the Survivor, Survivor Guardsman, Hunter and the Hunter Guardsman models. The Survivor models come in a bright stainless steel, high-luster finish while the Hunter models are available in a matte finish. The Guardsman models have squared-off <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> instead of the rounded <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> found on the non-Guardsman models.|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that [...] "Special Purpose" [...] models {{are not the same as}} [...] "Law Enforcement" [...] models; the latter have heavier duty barrels, safeties, <b>trigger</b> <b>guards,</b> and will stand up to harder use.|$|R
25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard,</b> which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|E
25|$|The F1 was {{followed}} by the G1 version that included several minor improvements, such as redesigned grips and an enlarged <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> for operation with gloves. However, the G1 remained conceptual and was never actually produced.|$|E
25|$|SIG P210-A: In January, 2016 SIG Sauer {{announced}} {{production of}} the P210-A in the Exeter, NH, United States factory. Three versions are planned: Standard, Target and Carry; with a magazine release close to the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> {{as opposed to a}} heel style release.|$|E
5000|$|Execution flow {{is defined}} using <b>Triggers,</b> <b>Guards</b> and Effects. The {{simulation}} supports re-runs with alteration to the triggered events and supports viewing variables, the call stack and setting debug markers. There is also support for interaction with emulated User-Interface screens containing common UI fields.|$|R
5000|$|Trigger weight {{had to be}} 500 grams for [...]22 {{short in}} ISSF regulations, {{compared}} to 1,360 grams for [...]22LR in the 1930s. Nowadays [...]22LR is reduced to 1,000 grams.Some <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> were drilled for a set screw to restrict rearward movement, thereby increasing speed in the Rapid Fire events.|$|R
50|$|A few {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} Model 69A after World War II. The bolt handle was changed from a {{straight}} to a slightly swept-back shape, a grooved trigger was introduced, and the receiver became available with grooves for aftermarket scope mounts. Late in the production run, chromed bolts, <b>trigger</b> <b>guards,</b> and magazine guard plates were introduced.|$|R
25|$|The firearm uses a fixed, {{polygonal}} {{rifled barrel}} (hexagonal with a 250mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced {{through the use}} of a profiled and enlarged <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gas-Block, {{handguard}} retainers and folding-stock mechanism {{components are}} cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, <b>trigger</b> <b>guard,</b> dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.|$|E
25|$|The Bodeo Model 1889 is a solid-framed, six-shot {{revolver}}. The revolver {{was designed}} in two distinct versions: a round-barreled version designed with a <b>trigger</b> <b>guard,</b> and an octagonal-barreled version with a folding trigger. The octagonal-barreled version was produced for {{rank and file}} Italian soldiers, while the round-barreled version was produced for non-commissioned officers and field officers. The folding trigger version was produced in greater numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Vest-Pocket Self-Cocker (same as Vest Pocket Safety Hammer {{but without}} half / full cocking sear) NOTE: Some <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> {{installed}} on this model had cutouts {{which would allow}} {{the installation of the}} half / full cocking sear. Early models had a -inch octagonal barrel with front sight, later models incorporated a short 1-inch round barrel, no front sight. Calibers: [...]22 and [...]32 ...|$|R
5000|$|Mossberg {{shotguns}} currently designated [...] "law enforcement models" [...] are 590A1s. 590A1s {{differ from}} other 500/590 shotguns, {{in that they}} have heavy barrels, metal <b>trigger</b> <b>guards,</b> and metal safeties. 590A1s are available in 14 in, 18.5 in, and 20 in barrels. The 590A1 is also used by the U.S. and allied armed forces, having been {{designed to meet the}} stricter standards outlined by the U.S. Army.|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{versions}} {{retained the}} German receiver ring markings, but some rifles, especially later ones, had them removed {{and a new}} serial number {{was added to the}} right side of the receiver above the stock line. The left side of the receiver retained the original markings. Barrels had a calibre designation stamp near the breech and a SCHULTZ & LARSEN OTTERUP or GEVAERFABRIKEN OTTERUP (early examples) marking applied to the barrel. Bolts were usually re-numbered to match the receiver, but old numbers remained visible on some bolt parts, <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> and magazine floorplates.|$|R
25|$|The PT92 can be {{distinguished}} from its modern Beretta counterpart primarily by having the safety {{mounted on the frame}} as opposed to on the slide like the Beretta. Though mechanically similar to the original, the PT92s differ from the early 92s by having a <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> similar to the modern 92s (the originals were rounded) and a magazine release in the same place as the modern 92s (the originals were {{at the bottom of the}} grip).|$|E
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b> The <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E
25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{produced by the}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of intermediate power (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic operating mechanism, fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b> In size and handling, it is much like an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E
30|$|The initial Pseudostate is a {{state that}} defines the {{starting}} point for the default state machine. It is represented by a black circle. The outgoing transition from the initial vertex may have behaviour, but not <b>trigger</b> or <b>guard.</b>|$|R
50|$|From a distance, the P228 can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} P226 {{by comparing the}} <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> (the P228's is curved, while the P226's is slightly hooked) and the barrel and slide lengths (the P228's barrel 99 mm, thus having a corresponding shorter slide). Also in a side-by-side comparison the P228 would appear slightly shorter (15 mm shorter) than the P226. The larger capacity P226 magazine can also be employed in the P228 although it extends {{from the base of}} the grip. Civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued with the introduction of 9mm chambering in the P229 but were recently reintroduced in limited quantities to civilians with an accessory rail and designated P228R.|$|R
50|$|Handguns {{must have}} a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an {{accessory}} rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge {{to the rear of}} the slide stop pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.|$|R
25|$|Grandpa Type A Nambus have {{multiple}} variances from the later Type A Modified. The Type A Modified, {{commonly referred to}} as Papa Nambu, were produced at the Tokyo Arsenal until the 7000 serial number range. The <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> of the Grandpa Type A Nambu were considered extremely cramped especially when wearing gloves and were enlarged in later produced models. The Grandpa Nambus also had a wooden bottom magazine and welded lanyard loops. Papa Nambus had aluminum bottomed magazines with lanyard loops retained in rings. Both the Grandpa and Papa type Nambus may have the Siamese juk symbol stamped on the rear grip indicating service in Thailand before World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{new design}} lacked the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> {{and it was}} {{chambered}} {{in a wide range}} of calibres from 6.35x16mm (.25 ACP), 7.65x17mm (.32 ACP), 9x17mm (.380 ACP), 9x23mm Largo, with most pistols exported to Peru in the 11.43x23mm (.45 ACP). The JO.LO.AR. pistols have a distinctive lever installed on the right hand side of the frame (referred as a Palancam') enabling the user to carry the pistol with the chamber empty and in time cock the weapon all with one hand which made it useful especially for the Peruvian Mounted Police who were on horseback. Many of these pistols were sold in the United States as surplus and can be considered as collectible firearms today.|$|E
25|$|The Astra 400 {{is heavy}} {{compared}} to many contemporary service pistols {{of the time}} like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 {{was designed to be}} safe to fire with a simple blowback action unaided by any breech-locking devices. This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong recoil spring. It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard to cock. The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b> The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and explore}} a new statechart (sc) abstraction method and define a simplified statechart (ssc) model. We study the basic building blocks (so the term `DNA') of UML sc models. Within this formal approach, we untangle the object-oriented concepts characterizing the UML. We treat <b>triggers,</b> <b>guards</b> and effects {{as related to}} each other, but make no reference to any explicit value (type) in the computation. This abstract approach allows us to introduce mathematical manipulations of UML sc, {{in line with the}} theory of regular automata. Statechart DNA has been applied in defining complexity metrics for UML sc models, the automatic generation of model test cases and behavior manipulations in CASE tool environments...|$|R
50|$|The carbine was {{designed}} and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full time to working on the weapon. The carbine used a special brass cartridge, also invented by Burnside. Pressing the weapon's two <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> opened the breech block and allowed the user to insert a cartridge. When the trigger was pulled, the hammer struck a percussion cap and caused a spark; {{a hole in the}} base of the cartridge exposed the black powder to this spark. The unique, cone-shaped cartridge sealed the joint between the barrel and the breech. Most other breech-loading weapons of the day tended to leak hot gas when fired, but Burnside's design eliminated this problem.|$|R
50|$|The new rifle {{features}} a heavy-taper stainless steel barrel, a detachable 10-round double-stack box magazine, custom iron sights calibrated from 100-600 meters, a laminated wooden stock, stainless steel construction with extra corrosion resistant coatings, and enlarged <b>trigger</b> <b>guards</b> and bolt handles {{so they can}} be used by rangers without requiring them to remove their gloves. The barrel, bolt and receiver will be made by Colt Canada under licence from SAKO. In addition to the rifle, the accessories package will include a custom-molded Pelican hard transport case, plus a soft transport case (outfitted with sling, extra magazines, a trigger lock and custom cleaning kit). Both hard case and soft case and rifle butt stock feature the Canadian Ranger badge.|$|R
25|$|Jackson {{learns that}} Django {{is waiting for}} him at Tombstone Cemetery and kills Nathaniel, but not before the latter hides María. Django, resting himself {{on the back of}} Mercedes Zaro’s cross, pulls the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard</b> off his {{revolver}} with his teeth and rests it against the cross, just as Jackson’s gang arrive. Believing that Django cannot make {{the sign of the cross}} with his mutilated hands, Jackson shoots the corners of Zaro's cross. Django then kills Jackson and his men by pushing the trigger against the cross and repeatedly pulling back the hammer. Leaving his pistol on Zaro’s cross, Django staggers out of the cemetery, ready to start a new life with María.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War, the British {{produced}} the No. 4 Mk 2 (Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals for official designations in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard,</b> beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood {{in the rear of}} the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass buttplates (during World War II, the British replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with zinc alloy (Zamak) ones to reduce costs and to speed up rifle production). With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their existing stocks of No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2. No. 4 Mk 1 rifles so upgraded were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/2, whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/3.|$|E
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the <b>trigger</b> <b>guard.</b> Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{equipped}} items {{now also}} affect a character's statistics. Armor, weapons, and accessories may increase health, attack, or defense; {{they may also}} grant skill points that allow the character to equip special traits that affect the character's playstyle. These traits may include automatically <b>triggered</b> <b>guard</b> impacts, the ability to cause damage against a blocking opponent, or even a statistic increase based on parameters such as an opponent's alignment or gender. Standard characters may also be modified in this manner, albeit only modestly, allowing custom costumes and skill sets {{to be used in}} Special VS. mode. Custom characters may still be used in Standard VS. mode, but without any of the special abilities gained through equipment or weapon choice. One profile is allowed for Offline VS. mode, meaning that only one profile's created characters can be loaded at any one time.|$|R
50|$|Standard flintlock pistols have a {{noticeable}} delay between {{pulling the trigger}} and actually firing the bullet. Purpose-built duelling pistols have various improvements {{to make them more}} reliable and accurate, such as longer and heavier barrels, spurs on the <b>trigger</b> <b>guards,</b> saw handles, platinum-lined touch-holes and hair triggers. All component parts were manufactured, hand-finished and then adjusted with great care and precision, which made duelling pistols much more costly than standard firearms of the period. Special care was taken when moulding the lead bullets to ensure that there were no voids which would affect accuracy. Pistols were carefully and identically loaded, and each duellist was offered his choice of the indistinguishable loaded pistols. As duels were generally fought at short distances which were paced out, typically 35 to 45 ft, between stationary opponents, extreme accuracy was not required.|$|R
50|$|The Frontier Model {{was created}} {{to compete with the}} Colt Model 1873 Single-Action Army (aka Peacemaker), Remington Model 1875, and Smith & Wesson Model 3 as a large frame, big bore six-shooter. Beginning in 1876, the Frontier was {{produced}} in four variations. All featured what we consider a 'conventional' <b>trigger</b> and <b>guard.</b> Most were produced in a nickel finish.|$|R
