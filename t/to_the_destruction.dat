5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{collection}} of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the large number of}} people killed during this time, over 100,000people were forced to evacuate.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived.

5|$|The five {{versions}} of the Lost World Pyramid were each larger than the previous version. They were not built directly centred upon the preceding version due to the necessity of maintaining the E-Group plaza area between the pyramid and the East Platform.

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E

5|$|Aramaic {{became the}} common {{language}} in the north, in Galilee and Samaria. Hebrew remained in use in Judah; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence, and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period. Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E

In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an outside loop {{to assist in the}} separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E

An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
