5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay <b>to</b> <b>temper</b> their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E

Tempered fractional Brownian motion, the tempered fractional integral or {{derivative of}} a Brownian mo-tion, is a new stochastic process whose increments can exhibit semi-long range dependence. The tempered finite difference op-erator is also useful in time series analysis, where it provides a useful new stochastic model for turbulent velocity data. Tem-pered stable processes are the limits of random walk models, where the power law probability of long jumps is tempered by an exponential factor.

25|$|Fasting {{is seen as}} {{purification}} and the regaining of innocence. It is {{a practice}} of learning <b>to</b> <b>temper</b> the body's primary desire for food. By learning <b>to</b> <b>temper</b> this basic desire of the body, the practitioner can more readily temper other worldly desires, and thus, become better enabled to draw closer to God {{in the hope of}} becoming more Christ-like. Through obedience to the Church and its ascetic practices the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the passions (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians are provided with a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view fasting as a hardship, but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the Church provides both the time and the amount of fasting that is expected as a minimum for every member who chooses to participate. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without food entirely {{for a short period of}} time. A complete three-day fast at the beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries.|$|E
25|$|In {{commerce}} and manufacturing, {{there are many}} uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquify gases - oxygen, nitrogen, propane and methane, for example. In compressed air purification, {{it is used to}} condense water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a high octane gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration <b>to</b> <b>temper</b> steel and cutlery.

Random walks with heavy tails converge to stable stochastic processes, whose probability densities solve space-fractional diffusion equa-tions. Continuous time random walks, with heavy tailed wait-ing times between particle jumps, converge to non-Markovian stochastic limits, whose probability densities solve time-fractional diffusion equations.

The retained austenite blocks (γb) decomposed in the samples tempered at 400 °C. A significant decrease in the microhardness value for the sample heat-treated at 270 °C can only be observed after the sample was tempered at 450 °C, because bainite was the predominant phase in the microstructure, which self-tempers as it forms...|$|R
