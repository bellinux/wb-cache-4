5|$|When the Romanians {{entered the}} war on 27 August 1916, <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> were again at Rustschuk, and were {{immediately}} attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> but struck a lighter loaded with fuel. Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day, the Second Monitor Division, consisting of Bodrog and three other monitors, set fire to oil storage tanks, the railway station and magazines, and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer {{on their way back}} to Belene. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled.|$|E
5|$|After the scuttling of <b>the</b> <b>monitors,</b> around 450 {{officers}} and {{men from the}} Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac.

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Körös was based at Zemun, just {{upstream}} from Belgrade on the Danube. Her commander was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topčider Hill, although Körös was not initially involved.

5|$|On 6 April 1941, {{when the}} World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began, Morava was based at Stara Kanjiža on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force {{was responsible for}} the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division Potiska. The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug R-XXI, the river transport Senta, and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, Morava withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, Poručnik bojnog broda Božidar Aranđelović, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant. On 10 April, Morava was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from Bačka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, Morava anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors Vardar and Sava, and Aranđelović took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> to navigate freely. The crews of <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.|$|E

40|$|Part I Introduction and {{justification}} of <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Building with Nature This report describes <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Building with Nature in the IJsselmeer region. When {{it comes to}} implementing the concept of building with nature the main issue is not how it is technically possible, but whether stakeholders consider it possible and desirable. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> gives insight into perceptions of stakeholders and provides possibilities for improvements in decision making and in generating societal support for Building with Nature projects. The project that developed this monitor {{is part of the}} Building with Nature research and innovations programme. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> has <b>the</b> following goals: Describe the (changes in) perceptions and actions related to ‘building with nature’ in hydraulic engineering projects. Among which: 1. Describe the situation of the project at the start of <b>the</b> <b>monitoring,</b> include <b>the</b> history of the project, the broad context, the assignment of the project, and the (formal) involvement of stakeholders. 2. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities at project level (design, project management, process). 3. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities for building with nature within the external field of force. 4. Make an inventory of perceptions related to improvements and the involvement of the different stakeholders. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is on perceptions of people who are involved in hydraulic engineering projects. For the development of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> existing monitor approaches are used. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is gathering of information and has characteristics of constructivist <b>monitoring.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> aims to show the diversity of the available perceptions and actions. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is not merely on ‘learning’, although when <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> is used in meetings or workshops, it can contribute to learning about building with nature. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> is qualitative of nature, with implicit use of indicators. <b>The</b> <b>monitor</b> is one of <b>the</b> initiatives of <b>monitoring</b> within <b>the</b> Research programme Building with Nature. One other initiative is for example <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> of <b>the</b> Community of Practice in the IJsselmeer region. Part II <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> – Questionnaire In preparing for the use of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> three main questions are to be asked. The first question is: what is the focus in the project? The second question is: who are the respondents and why? There are no universal criteria, nor are these desirable. And the third question is: how do we use the questionnaire? Are we interested in doing face to face interviews, or interviews by phone? How the questionnaire is used depends largely on the goal of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and <b>the</b> resources (i. e. time, money, people) availableThe questionnaire consists of four different parts. Part A discusses issues related to building with nature within the project and deals with stakeholders’ perceptions of the concept. Part B discusses factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature. Part C is about placing issues on the agenda and possibilities for improvements. Part D rounds up the questionnaire. For analysing the results of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> following elements compromise the framework of analysis: 1. Aspects perceived as characteristic for building with nature 2. Aspects of building with nature in the project 3. Best practices of building with nature according to respondents 4. Perceptions of factors and conditions which stimulate or obstruct building with nature. 5. Perceptions of the future and future possibilities for realizing building with nature 6. Perceptions of action perspectives to realize building with nature on large scale in multiple 7. projects in the IJsselmeer region. Part III <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> tested To test <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> two projects were selected as pilots: the dike strengthening project Edam- Amsterdam and the silt catch pit. Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> in these projects has lead to an improved version of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and lessons learned on how to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> It was not possible to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> itself in <b>the</b> dike strengthening project, although the process was very useful. We found that interesting projects to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> also are subject to sensitive issues. Great concern is necessary to deal with these issues. Therefore, sensitive issues require more preparation time. In the project ‘silt catch pit’ we were able to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and make a case description of the project. Applying the questionnaire and developing the case description lead to improvements of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and recommendations on its use. On the development of <b>the</b> <b>monitor,</b> <b>the</b> following is concluded: •Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> results in a broad insight into the feasibility of the building with nature concept, factors which are of influence and insight into the decision making in building with nature projects. •It is recommended to have an exploratory interview before using the questionnaire. This is necessary to gain enough information relevant for the case description, gain permission to apply <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> and get in contact with the relevant stakeholders. •Applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> in <b>the</b> silt catch pit showed that it is very suitable to find factors influencing the feasibility of building with nature in projects. Because it was only possible to develop one pilot, we recommend to again reflect critically on <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> when applied. •Sensitive issues may make a project an (more) interesting one for applying <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> However, it may be more difficult to acquire permission for application and it may require more time. During application of <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> one {{should be aware of the}} issues. Demarcation of concepts is important for the sake of comparing results, as the questionnaires are used for different persons and in different moments in time •The questionnaire can be combined with workshops or meetings to stimulate the realization of the building with nature concept. •The case description is based on a monitor that is incomplete and is part of developing <b>the</b> <b>monitor.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> case description should not be used as a complete example and should be considered together with the conclusions and recommendations made...|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. <b>The</b> <b>monitors</b> were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the shutter, one shell struck {{the edge of the}} shutter, creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E

5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and <b>the</b> <b>monitors,</b> symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title.

5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
5|$|In March 1917, Enns {{relocated}} to Brăila in eastern Romania, where it remained until July 1918. Sent to Linz and Budapest for an overhaul in dry dock, Enns {{then returned to}} eastern Romania and was stationed at Reni where she met a group of monitors and patrol boats that had been operating against Russia in the Black Sea. In October 1918, the Danube Flotilla was under serious threat of being cut off in the lower Danube by French forces after the Bulgarians concluded an armistice with the British and French. After the steamer Croatia was fired on by the French as it tried to get past Lom, she cut her tow line, releasing seven lighters, which ran aground on a sandbank. Croatia was hit, suffered casualties and grounded on the Romanian side of the river. The French retrieved three of the lighters and towed them into the anchorage at Lom. The following day, Enns and two other monitors managed to release three of the remaining lighters while under heavy French fire, and towed them upstream. The flotilla continued to retreat up the Danube, running the gauntlet of French and Serbian forces. With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in early November, the South Slavs went ashore at Vukovar. The Austrian, Hungarian and Czech crew members of the flotilla continued on their journey, arriving in Budapest on 6 November, and Enns began flying the Hungarian flag, {{as part of the}} navy of the Hungarian People's Republic. On 8 December, <b>the</b> <b>monitors</b> were seized by the Allies, and less than two weeks later Enns was towed to Belgrade where she was handed over to Serbia to be maintained on behalf of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).|$|E
