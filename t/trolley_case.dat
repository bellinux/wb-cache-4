40|$|Discussion of the “problem of numbers” in {{morality}} {{has focused}} {{almost exclusively on}} the moral significance of numbers in whom-to-rescue cases: when you can save either of two groups of people, but not both, does {{the number of people}} in each group matter morally? I suggest that insufficient attention has been paid to the moral significance of numbers in other types of case. According to common-sense morality, numbers make a difference in cases, like the famous <b>Trolley</b> <b>Case,</b> where we must choose whether to kill a person (or persons) as a side effect of saving a greater number. I argue that recognition of the role of numbers in killing cases forces us to reassess purported solutions to the problem of numbers...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} linked human {{exposure}} to pollutants with adverse health effects. Passenger exposure in public transport systems contributes an important fraction of daily burden of air pollutants. While there is extensive literature reporting {{the concentrations of}} pollutants in public transport systems in different cities, there are few studies systematically addressing the heterogeneity of passenger exposure in different transit microenvironments, in cabins of different transit vehicles and in areas with different characteristics. The present study investigated PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2. 5 μm), black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP) and carbon monoxide (CO) pollutant concentrations in various public road transport systems in highly urbanized city of Hong Kong. Using a <b>trolley</b> <b>case</b> housing numerous portable air monitors, we conducted a total of 119 trips during the campaign. Transit microenvironments, classified as 1). busy and secondary roadside bus stops; 2). open and enclosed termini; 3). above- and under-ground Motor Rail Transport (MTR) platforms, were investigated and compared to identify the factors that may affect passenger exposures. The pollutants inside bus and MTR cabins were also investigated together with a comparison of time integrated exposure between the transit modes. Busy roadside and enclosed termini demonstrated the highest average particle concentrations while the lowest {{was found on the}} MTR platforms. Traffic-related pollutants BC, UFP and CO showed larger variations than PM 2. 5 across different microenvironments and areas confirming their heterogeneity in urban environments. In-cabin pollutant concentrations showed distinct patterns with BC and UFP high in diesel bus cabins and CO high in LPG bus cabins, suggesting possible self-pollution issues and/or penetration of on-road pollutants inside cabins during bus transit. The total passenger exposure along selected routes, showed bus trips had the potential for higher integrated passenger exposure compared to MTR trips. The present study may provide useful information to better characterize the distribution of passenger exposure pattern in health assessment studies and the results also highlight the need to formulate exposure reduction based air policies in large cities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Facts in Feminist Philosophy track. Experimental philosophy, (henceforth called X-Phi), represents a departure from traditional philosophy; instead of privileging intuitions of professional philosophers to analyze concepts like moral responsibility, knowledge, intentional action, etc., X-phi catalogs and analyzes the intuitions of ordinary people (that is, non-philosophers) about scenarios designed to uncover the concepts found in standard usage. It formulates explanations of those intuitions that may reveal more complex and nuanced philosophical concepts. X-philosophers create variations of standard philosophical thought-experiments (like that old chestnut, the <b>trolley</b> <b>case)</b> in order to test out their own hypotheses about what features are morally salient in the process of giving a response. This is standard practice in social science research as well. However, it does sometimes happen that researcher-framed scenarios miss, or over-emphasize or under-emphasize the role of some feature of the situation. It may not be clear, for instance, whether the reason for the divergence of responses in an X-phi survey is epistemic or moral—that is, the data produced (namely quantitative response patterns) underdetermines the underlying psychological processes and moral intuitions of the respondents. In short, these sorts of experiments do not reveal what features of a scenario people think they are reacting to or what reasoning patterns and moral intuitions they think they are using in that situation. Given that X-philosophers take as a guiding principle that what people think their cognitive processes are is relevant to a philosophical investigation of the actual nature of those cognitive processes, this can limit their effectiveness. We argue that X-Phi could (and in many cases should) go farther into the realm of empirical investigation through gathering qualitative information about real-life experiences that use the philosophical concepts in question. In this way, by allowing ordinary people the power to frame scenarios themselves and identify which features they think are salient for their particular judgments, philosophy genuinely incorporates the experiences of individuals into a coherent, complex and multi-faceted account of important philosophical concepts. Including a multiplicity of voices and views also fits within a view of epistemic practice that recognizes the ways in which value judgments and the social contexts in which they occur exert strong influences on resulting theory. When examining the sources of complex practices (like formation of moral judgments), an often-overlooked but important resource is those persons whose knowledge is not abstract or principled, but situated within some practice—practitioners with situated, contextual and particular knowledge. Feminist epistemologists argue not only for the epistemic benefits of inclusion of situated knowers in the arenas of intellectual inquiry, but also for its moral value. Indeed, many critics find the epistemic and moral realms to be inextricable: “to decide what is epistemically valuable we need to decide what kind of knowledge community is desirable, and this can’t help but involve political priorities and political choices”(Haslanger, 1999). By giving situated knowers the opportunity to frame scenarios for themselves, identifying which features of their situation are salient, they are treated with “tempered equality” of intellectual authority (Longino, 2001,); that is, they are given a voice and taken seriously in the course of development and critique of the knowledge-seeking process at hand. In our proposed methodological expansion, we offer examples of interview scripts that ask questions to elicit detailed and perspectival information from respondents. Qualitative methods are used to explore questions along a continuum of involvement by the researcher – ranging from ethnographic methods of observation where the data collection is determined by the context, to narrative analysis that relies upon content of the informant’s stories in a particular area of interest, to open-ended, in-depth interviews whereby the analyst may provide more or less structure to the interview guide depending upon the nature of the investigation. In one example, the interviewer includes follow-up questions to elicit information about how family relations might be relevant and whether issues of potential discrimination are involved. In keeping with X-philosophy methods, we also provide empirical data for our claims. We present results of our qualitative study (currently in progress, to be completed spring 2010) of student fast-food workers, examining their attitudes about work, food, and the potential effects of their social network connections on their eating behaviors at work and at home. We discuss the ways in which our interviews contributed to an increased understanding of issues of control, agency, and identity in the social context of eating and working. We also point out limitations of the methods and areas for further study. In conclusion, we make both a conceptual and empirical case for developing X-phi methods that include and value a multiplicity of perspectives and embrace the complexity of human experience. By doing so, we reap both epistemic and moral benefits. This process of inquiry is parallel to attempts in other disciplines, such as health care, that strive to include the values and experiences of both practitioners with hands on tacit knowledge as well as the disenfranchised for whom public health programs are often designed. Berwick (2008) argues for expansion of the standards for evidence in healthcare to include both the examination of “mechanisms (i. e. ways in which specific social programs actually produce specific social changes) and contexts (i. e. local conditions that could have influenced the outcomes of interest) ”. Cartwright (2009) advocates extending those same standards of evidence to healthcare policy, pointing out the need for theories of evidence that deal with both credibility and relevance. Expanding methods of x-phi to include qualitative approaches has the opportunity to inform both epistemic and moral landscapes and the potential to reinforce these shifts in other areas of inquiry as well. Such an approach in philosophy can enable understanding across differences without eliminating the viewpoints of those who may not be philosophers but whose voices should be heard...|$|E

Here, it is tested directly if bankers respond differently to moral dilemmas. Evaluations of the moral acceptableness of behavioural options in two <b>trolley</b> <b>cases</b> by bankers (n = 23) are compared to those of ordinary people (n = 274). An apparent difference in response behaviour between the groups can be fully explained by a difference in the response behaviour of men and women.

40|$|Michael Otsuka {{claims that}} it is impermissible to kill {{innocent}} threats because doing so is morally equivalent to killing bystanders. I show that Otsuka's argument conflates killing as a means with treating a person herself as a means. The killing of a person can be a means only if that person is instrumental in the threat to Victim's life. A permission to kill a person as a means will not permit killing bystanders. I also defend a permission to kill innocent threats against Otsuka's <b>Trolley</b> <b>Cases.</b> Otsuka depicts a person tied to an oncoming trolley as a bystander. I argue that such characters are threats whom Victim can permissibly kill. ...|$|R
40|$|A runaway trolley is {{approaching}} {{a fork in}} the tracks. If the trolley runs on its cur-rent track, it will kill a work crew of five.

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} scenarios generally {{known as}} trolley problems have become widespread in recent moral philosophy. They invariably require an agent {{to choose one}} of a strictly limited number of options, all of them bad. Although they don’t always involve trolleys / trams, and are {{used to make a}} wide variety of points, what makes it justified to speak of a distinctive “trolley method” is the characteristic assumption that the intuitive reactions that all these artificial situations elicit constitute an appropriate guide to real-life moral reasoning. I dispute this assumption by arguing that <b>trolley</b> <b>cases</b> inevitably constrain the supposed rescuers into behaving in ways that clearly deviate from psychologically healthy, and morally defensible, human behavior. Through this focus on a generally overlooked aspect of trolley theorizing – namely, the highly impoverished role invariably allotted to the would-be rescuer in these scenarios – I aim to challenge the complacent twin assumptions of advocates of the trolley method that this approach to moral reasoning has practical value, and is in any case innocuous. Neither assumption is true...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's Prospect Theory offers a better explanation of our decision making under uncertainty {{than some of}} the most widely accepted theories to-date, including especially Expected Utility Theory. I give a sympathetic summary of the case against Expected Utility Theory, but then show how Prospect Theory has not demonstrated that it can give a better explanation of our moral decision making under uncertainty (contrary, e. g., to the claims of Tamara Horowitz). In particular, it has not been demonstrated that it can give a better explanation of our intuitions in hard cases, such as the much discussed <b>Trolley</b> Car <b>cases</b> concocted by Philippa Foot and developed by her and Warren Quinn, among other contemporary moral philosophers concerned with issues often studied by both Expected Utility Theory and Prospect Theory. Prospect Theory has a weakness in common with Expected Utility Theory, namely, both are too focused on the consequences of our actions. In this respect, Prospect Theory is a consequentialist theory of moral decision making, and I bring out Prospect Theory's limitations by exploring the work of Foot's and Quinn's non-consequentialist theorizing in this context, with special emphasis on the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, and related principles like the Doctrine of Double Effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothetical}} is {{the staple}} {{of the law school}} classroom and useful in most intellectual endeavors. But, this inaugural lecture argues, interlocutors frequently misuse and misinterpret responses to hypotheticals because they demand that their respondents accept the “facts” embedded within. This form of argument, dubbed “FAKE” (for “Facts Are Known Exactly”), poses “facts” that are either impossible to accept or highly improbable and that would provoke counterarguments but for the command to accept the facts as hypothesized. The author presents his thesis in part through the lens of recent literature on the ethics of runaway <b>trolley</b> cars (these <b>cases</b> constitute a field of study known as “trolleyology”) and questions whether the answers we give and the preconceptions we seem to have about the morality of saving many at the expense of one can be explained by examining responses to the hypotheticals provided. The paper also examines the FAKE argument as used to justify assisted suicide, the right to harshly cross-examine the truth-telling but infirm witness, and upholding the law by violating it.
