5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S.

Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

5|$|Maribor's {{tally of}} 14 Slovenian Championships {{and the total}} of nine Slovenian Cup titles is the highest in Slovenian football. Maribor holds the record for most {{consecutive}} league titles (7), ahead of Olimpija (4) and Gorica (3). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> only team {{in the country that}} has achieved the Slovenian Championship and the Slovenian Cup doubles {{on more than one occasion}} (4). In addition, they are the only club who has won the Slovenian version of the treble, having won the league, cup and supercup during the 2012–13 season. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once. In addition, they were the first team to win 1,000 points in Slovenian top flight, achieving that with a 2–1 away victory against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit diving exerts greater {{pressures}} (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but {{the reward}} {{is a greater}} area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. Propulsion underwater can be provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, diving petrels and some other species of petrel) or feet (as used by cormorants, grebes, loons and several types of fish-eating ducks). Wing-propelled divers are generally faster than foot-propelled divers. In both cases, the use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), penguins cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of underwater diving. For example, the razorbill (an Atlantic auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size. Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding procellariids, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. The deepest diving exhibited by shearwaters {{is found in the}} short-tailed shearwater, which has been recorded diving below 70m. Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with light-mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at 12m. Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> poorest divers. This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, as it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds, especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding.|$|E
