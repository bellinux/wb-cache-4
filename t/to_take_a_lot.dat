Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here.

500|$|Construction was {{suspended}} {{shortly after the}} war began and the Admiralty {{took advantage of the}} time to refine the design in light of war experience in late 1941. The beam was increased to 108 ft, the maximum width allowed by the locks of the Panama Canal, to increase the depth and effectiveness of ship's torpedo protection system, and almost [...] of fuel oil were added to increase the ship's endurance. However, this beam increase meant that many of the Royal Navy home docking facilities, including Rosyth and Portsmouth, can no longer accommodate these ships. The requirement that 'A' turret {{had to be able to}} fire directly ahead at 0° elevation was rescinded as it radically reduced freeboard forward and caused the King George Vs <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of water over the bow in head seas. To partially compensate for the additional weight, the belt armour was reduced in thickness by [...] to [...] except over the magazines, and the aircraft and their facilities were removed.

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2008 with Downey's signing. Though Don Cheadle was also {{reported}} to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated {{that he did not}} think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man2, Thor (2011), and [...] (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would [...] "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, [...] "It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The female superhero Wasp was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johansson's involvement. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities, the surviving 39 Hs 123s assigned to II. (Schl)/LG 2, were committed to action in the Polish Campaign. This single unit proved to be particularly effective. Screaming {{over the heads of}} enemy troops, the Hs 123s delivered their bombs with devastating accuracy. A frightening aspect of an Hs 123 attack was the staccato noise of its engine that a pilot could manipulate by changing rpm to create [...] "gunfire-like" [...] bursts. The Hs 123 proved rugged and able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of damage and still keep on flying. Operating from primitive bases close to the front lines, the type was considered by ground crews to be easy to maintain and reliable in field conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Summers' musicality {{impressed}} Sting, who {{was becoming}} frustrated with Padovani's rudimentary abilities and the limitations they {{imposed on the}} Police's potential. Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece version but they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the Music Machine in London and on 5 August at the Mont de Marsan Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-Velvet Underground member John Cale as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum and Padovani was dismissed from the band. The effect of Summers' arrival was instant with Copeland stating: [...] "One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started {{to get a lot}} more interesting and Sting started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more interest in the group." ...|$|E

Baker said, however, that the album will not be released until 2017.

That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after True North?

2500|$|While the pay {{was very}} low by the {{standards}} of the day, in an era of significant racial prejudice, being a Pullman porter was one of the best jobs available for African-American men. Thus, for black men, while this was an opportunity, at the same time it was also an experience of being stereotyped as the servant class and having <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of abuse. [...] Many passengers called every porter “George", as if he were George Pullman’s “boy” (servant), a practice that was born in the South where slaves were named after their slavemasters. The only ones who protested were other men named George, who founded the Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters George, or SPCSCPG, which eventually claimed 31,000 members. [...] Although the SPCSCPG was more interested in defending the dignity of its white members than in achieving any measure of racial justice, it nevertheless had some effects for all porters. In 1926, the SPCSCPG persuaded the Pullman Company to install small racks in each car, displaying a card with the given name of the porter on duty. Of the 12,000 porters and waiters then working for Pullman, only 362 turned out to be named George. [...] Stanley G. Grizzle, a former Canadian porter, titled his autobiography, My Name's Not George: The Story of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.|$|E

2500|$|The Weinhaus Huth, {{with its}} {{distinctive}} corner cupola, was a wedge-shaped structure {{located in the}} angle between Potsdamer Straße and Linkstraße (literally [...] "Left Street"), and with entrances in both streets. Wine merchant Friedrich Karl Christian Huth, whose great-grandfather had been kellermeister (cellar-master) to King Friedrich II back in 1769, had founded the firm in 1871 and taken over the former building in Potsdamer Straße on 23 March 1877. His son, the wine wholesale dealer William (“Willy”) Huth (1877–1967), took over the business in 1904 and, a few years later, commissioned {{the replacement of the}} building by a new one on the same site. Running right through the block into Linkstraße, this new Weinhaus Huth was designed by the architects Conrad Heidenreich (1873–1937) and Paul Michel (1877–1938), and opened on 2 October 1912, and contained a wine restaurant on the ground floor, and wine storage space above, so it had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of weight. It was thus given a strong steel skeleton, which would stand the building in very good stead some three decades after its completion. Famous for its fine claret, numerous members of European society were made welcome there as guests.
