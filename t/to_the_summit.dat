5|$|The Llanberis Path is {{the longest}} route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> and has the shallowest gradient. It largely follows {{the line of the}} Snowdon Mountain Railway, and is {{considered}} the easiest and least interesting route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Snowdon. It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> was practically impossible until {{the construction of a}} road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> exist, in various states of use.|$|E

5|$|Some of the fauna {{reported}} on the climb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> include black bears, marmots, mule deer, pikas, and pocket gophers; there are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey and bighorn sheep {{are present in the}} area during the summer.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountain}} had {{a circular}} pathway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> The top offered {{a panoramic view}} of each of the existing sections. Strollers were not permitted. The walk-way was permanently closed in 1984 so that Vortex could be built.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> none of which came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|There are 25 {{main routes}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> with {{alternates}} of those main routes.

5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named the {{mountain}} in 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain hiking trail in the United States, was laid out in 1819 as a bridle path from Crawford Notch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress {{on the right-hand side}} of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and in a couple of gullies which lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, {{in large part because}} of the lobbying efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land, including the Waterfall Gully area, was later combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up into the hills <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. During 1943, the Municipality of Burnside was proclaimed the City of Burnside.|$|E

5|$|Most notable was {{the closure}} of the Monitor Ridge trail, which {{previously}} let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers.

5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, the trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail {{is the most popular}} trail in the notch, ascending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are {{extremely}} difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of the trail is frequently bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of DPeak.|$|E
5|$|Other recent {{enhancements}} to {{tourist infrastructure}} across the massif have included {{construction of a}} new, and ultra-modern Goûter Hut to accommodate the increasing numbers of mountaineers attempting the popular Goûter Route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Mont Blanc, and investment of ½ billion euros in Les Grands Montets and other ski areas over a six-year period from 2014 onwards.|$|E
