25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> In, and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology.

Arjona commented that [...] "'Quién' is the world {{out of the window}} and the prison built by ourselves. It's the freedom to choose the path or to prefer loneliness as an argument of nostalgia. 'Quién' is a story with the hurry of the desperate, is the flashback of those who end up loving alone." [...] "Quiero", also written by Arjona, was released as the second single in November 2007. Website ADN Mundo called the song bohemian and hippie, and that it was [...] "a love story that doesn't speak about love, but instead about the recent events on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> [...] and finally comes to the search of an individual who challenges nostalgia finding entertainment on the impossible."

2500|$|While {{abstract}} metaphysics {{provides us}} with a world of beauty and purpose and various other [...] "highers", it condemns other key aspects of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in as imaginary.

We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend 2001 doesn't exist when you're making Interstellar." [...] He also said that Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979) influenced Interstellars production design: [...] "Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction.
