In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
25|$|People {{who have}} ventromedial frontal cortex lesions {{were found to}} be more likely to reject unfair offers. This was {{suggested}} to be due to the abstractness and delay of the reward, rather than an increased emotional response to <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the offer.|$|E

25|$|The local Church {{officials}} on Corfu (as {{well as on}} the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood. Similarly the Greek press played a role in publicizing <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the accusations. The culprits were never prosecuted, however.|$|E

Coleman was convicted in the 1981 rape and stabbing death of his 19-year-old sister-in-law, Wanda McCoy. Coleman drew national attention, even making the cover of Time, by repeatedly claiming innocence and protesting <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the death penalty. DNA results announced on January 12, 2006 confirmed Coleman's guilt.|$|E

50|$|Hall {{was embarrassed}} that the LCL was {{even in a}} {{position}} to govern despite having clearly lost in terms of actual votes.

25|$|The {{second reason}} {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|Chen became {{involved}} in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court. While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen {{came to be known}} for his forceful and colorful arguments. He has stated that it was during this period that he realized <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the political system in Taiwan and became politically active {{as a member of the}} Tangwai movement.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the United States Sentencing Commission {{amended the}} Federal Sentencing Guidelines {{to lessen the}} {{disparity}} between the penalties for the possession and trafficking of powder cocaine and crack cocaine, citing racial disparity and <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the 100-1 crack-powder penalty threshold ratio. The Commission instead implemented an 18-1 ratio. Michael Mukasey, in the Attorney General's capacity, vehemently opposed and testified against this change, warning that thousands of violent criminals may be released under the guidelines and endanger the community. Mukasey's move was criticized by advocates of elimination of crack-powder disparity.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, a {{sub-committee}} of the regatta’s Committee of Management discussed {{options for}} reducing <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the course. Their recommendation {{was to move}} the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start {{to the bottom of}} Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E
25|$|Tara held great {{significance}} to the Irish population {{as it was the}} historic seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the Irish King Brian Boru defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others. He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of £2,000, although he was released after three months by the House of Lords, which quashed the conviction and severely criticised <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.|$|E

25|$|After the war Johnston {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} for himself and his wife, who was ailing. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was bored with the position and the company failed for lack of capital. He established in 1868 an insurance company in Savannah, Georgia, acting as an agent for the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South. The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great postwar activity, writing his memoirs. His Narrative of Military Operations, published in 1874, was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals, continuing his grievance about <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> his ranking as a general and attempting to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly and its publisher failed to make a profit.|$|E
25|$|In early 1945 Powers was {{directed}} to a race relations meeting in Chicago with the new American Council on Race Relations and began an endeavor of learning himself and then promulgating race relations issues across police departments. The first major project started in Richmond, California with Davis McEntire. Initial efforts were aimed at training the police in human relations including trying to eliminate prejudice and present <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> segregation and discrimination based on race - factors later observed to be widespread needs. The work brought together leaders of the California Department of Corrections, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Japanese American Citizens League, and a Nisei, second-generation American of Japanese descent, US Marine. Together the social norms and prejudices of the day were vented, discussed, and broken down across a week of open-ended discussions. Following the training incendiary incidents arose {{in the community and}} the police took novel actions ensuring fairness and peace was retained. The Saturday Evening Post covered it in Cops don't have to be brutal, Dec 28, 1946. Following this numerous police departments even outside California were informed of the training and a booklet A Guide to Race Relations for Peace Officers was created and distributed, (including excerpts in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper.) There was a prospective project by the young American Council on Race Relations using it and on making a training film with Powers writing the script, working with Edwin Embree. Out of this Powers was on a short list of leaders in the field though more recent scholarship critiqued the program for not including the local minority leadership of the time.|$|E
500|$|Starting as {{a working-class}} girl and {{experiencing}} music halls, prostitution, luxury, and a socialist struggle for utopia, Nan's journeys through the class system in Tipping the Velvet are {{as varied as}} her gender portrayals and love affairs. Aiobheann Sweeney in The Washington Post notes, [...] "like Dickens, [...] digs around in the poorhouses, prisons and asylums {{to come up with}} characters who not only court and curtsy but dramatise <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> poverty and gender disparity in their time".|$|E
40|$|Presumption of Equality {{requires}} that individuals be treated equally {{in the absence}} of relevant information that would discriminate between them. Our objective is to make this principle more precise, if viewed as a principle of fairness, and to determine why and under what conditions it should be obeyed. Presumption norms are procedural constraints, but their justification can be sought in the possible or expected outcomes of the procedures they regulate. This is the avenue pursued here. The suggestion is that {{in the absence of}} information that would discriminate between the individuals, equal treatment minimizes <b>the</b> expected <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcome. A related suggestion is that equal treatment under these circumstances also minimizes <b>the</b> maximal possible <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcome. Whether these suggestions are correct or not depends on the properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>unfairness</b> measure. <b>The</b> required properties are specified. The essay also considers the normative status of equal lotteries on unequal treatments...|$|R

500|$|It {{appears that}} Espejo was {{motivated}} {{more by the}} opportunity to attack his personal enemies in this work than to analyze the case and defend the clergy of Riobamba. Still, his talent as a lawyer {{can be seen in}} his Representaciones (Representations), which caused him to be freed after his arrest in 1787 for his supposed authorship of El Retrato de Golilla. In these documents, he defended his loyalty to the Crown, commented on <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> his captivity by mentioning the indignation that many distinguished men felt about his arrest, and clarified his writing goals.
