5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E

Canoeing and kayaking on Larrys Creek are possible {{when the water}} is high enough (in Spring and after hard rain), with [...] of Class 3 whitewater on the International Scale of River Difficulty from Township Road 786 south through the State Game Lands to Route 973, and [...] of Class 1 to 2 whitewater south from PA 973 to U.S. 220.|$|E

Crime-scene photographs not {{made available to the}} original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body. The gun itself also appears to have moved. Former Lancashire Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell, shown the photographs by the Guardian and Observer, said in 2011: [...] "The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again {{to make it look like}} it was originally. And if that has happened, and that hasn't been disclosed, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really,</b> really serious." ...|$|E

500|$|Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a {{disabled}} former Marine who {{becomes part of}} the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down. Worthington, who was living in his car at the time, auditioned twice early in development, and he has signed on for possible sequels. Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character [...] "a quality <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> real". Cameron said he [...] "has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world".|$|E
500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't Look Any Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> effective." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> not fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, {{the agents}} visit Boggs in prison, where he makes an impassioned revelation about the kidnapped couple {{based on a}} piece of [...] "evidence" [...] <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a shred of Mulder's T-shirt. Satisfied that he is lying, the pair prepare to leave. Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father, {{speaking}} to her and singing the song that had been played at his funeral, [...] "Beyond the Sea". She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case. Scully, acting on these, first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held, and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple. The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Johnny Blaze, Schwartz {{said that}} [...] "Marvel TV is {{introducing}} {{the idea of}} multiple Ghost Riders into its mythology, which {{sets the stage for}} Robbie Reyes not being the only one possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in this world. That's more than we could have hoped for Agents of SHIELDs take on the iconic Marvel hero." [...] She [...] speculated that a spin-off featuring Blaze and/or Reyes was now a realistic possibility. Buxton said that [...] "Marvel just established a much bigger Ghost Rider mythos that can be explored on TV, in movies, or Netflix and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> damn exciting." [...] Valentine felt the appearance was a [...] "pretty amazing development", and stated, [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. almost seemed hamstrung by its connections to the Marvel Universe, seemingly unable to make a move without first consulting what precisely was happening in the movie universe. [...] we’re shown what Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been all along: a sister piece that plays to the outer elements of the MCU that the movies haven’t been able to touch." ...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien quotes {{at length}} what the scholar W. P. Ker thought of Beowulf, namely that [...] "there is nothing {{much in the}} story", and that [...] "the great beauty, the real value, of Beowulf is in its dignity of style". Tolkien notes that Ker's opinion had been a {{powerful}} influence in favour of a paradoxical contrast between the poem's supposed defect in speaking of monsters, and (in Tolkien's words) its agreed [...] "dignity, loftiness in converse, and well-wrought finish". Tolkien cites other critics, such as Raymond Wilson Chambers and Ritchie Girvan, who objected to the poem's [...] "wilderness of dragons" [...] and its unworthy choice of theme. Tolkien finds it improbable that [...] "a mind lofty and thoughtful", {{as evidenced by the}} quality of the poetry, [...] "would write more than three thousand lines (wrought to a high finish) on matter <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> not worth serious attention". He notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth, but argues that myth has a special value: [...] "For myth is alive at once and in all its parts, and dies before it can be dissected." [...] Finally Tolkien states directly [...] "We do not deny the worth of the hero by accepting Grendel and the dragon." ...|$|E

500|$|Tyrion is intelligent, witty, well-read, {{and shares}} his father's skill for {{business}} and political maneuvering. Grossman describes the character as [...] "a bitter, cynical, high-born dwarf", calling him [...] "Martin's Falstaff". David Orr of The New York Times notes Tyrion to be [...] "a cynic, a drinker, an outcast and conspicuously the novels' most intelligent presence". As an outcast, he displays sympathy for other outcasts and the otherwise mistreated; the TV series version of the character commiserates with the illegitimate son of Ned Stark by saying [...] "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes." [...] Still, he is usually seen for his deformities and vices, rather than his virtues and good deeds. Tom Shippey of the Wall Street Journal points out that other characters underestimate Tyrion: [...] "His dwarf-status acts {{as a kind of}} protection, because—though he is probably the most intelligent character in the whole cast list—no one takes him seriously." [...] Acknowledging that Tyrion's wit, humor and cunning are his survival mechanism, actor Dinklage told The New York Times that [...] "He knows he has no skills with the sword and this is a world <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> deeply violent. Military rules. He {{would not be able to}} survive in that world, given his own strength. So he beats people to the punchline—he's entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.5 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, highlighting the reunion {{of the six}} original team members and their evolved dynamic, despite {{what he called a}} [...] "contrived" [...] set up for that situation. He felt that using the characters of List and Hill to tie the series into Age of Ultron was [...] "the right way" [...] to tie the two together, and was also positive of the character beats for Simmons and Palamas. Goldman also made special mention of Tancharoen's direction of the one-shot fight, though he felt that Tancharoen's May vs. Agent 33 fight from [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] was the superior sequence, and of the visual effects for the shooting down of the Bus. The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] a 'B+', also noting that [...] "has to take some shortcuts to reunite the original team, but the momentum picks up considerably once everyone is in the same room". Discussing the changed in the main characters {{from the start of the}} series, Sava particularly noted the development of Skye into [...] "kick-ass Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and praised Tancharoen as [...] "the one director on this series <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> going out of his way to create memorable action sequences". Sava called the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "overt", with Raina's clairvoyance [...] "a convenient plot device to put certain pieces in place", but ultimately felt that [...] "those big-screen connections don’t interrupt the focus on relationships".|$|E
500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E

He might do, but he'd let Ianto {{know that he}} [...] has to play around on the side". The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined {{in an interview at}} Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman {{said in an interview that}} Ianto [...] "brings out the [...] "human" [...] in [...] " [...] and [...] "brings out more ... empathy because he’s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... makes him warm to other people ... makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto’s always made him care and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the heart of the show." [...] However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is [...] "serious and committed", but while dancing with Gwen in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity", and considers it [...] "obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen". The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is [...] "just a shag", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his [...] "boyfriend". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play [...] "The Dead Line" [...] (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists [...] "You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones. Not to me." ...|$|E
