5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over two years}} and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E
5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) looks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> of fairy tales and discovers {{that the last}} few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me is {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E

25|$|Camden's Remaines {{is often}} the {{earliest}} or sole usage cited for a word in the Oxford English Dictionary; and further significant early usages (including new words and antedatings) have since been identified. Remaines also contains the first-ever alphabetical list of English proverbs, since heavily exploited by {{the editors of the}} principal modern dictionaries of proverbs (including those of Burton Stevenson (1949), M. P. Tilley (1950) and the third edition of the Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs, edited by F. P. Wilson (1970)).

25|$|About halfway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> Cochran and Harpending {{pause to}} {{consider}} {{two different ways}} of looking at the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that {{the three types of}} material interspersed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> – poetic, narrative, and biographical – come from different sources or circles. Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably {{to be found in the}} poetic sections of chapters 1–25, but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers (including perhaps the prophet's companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists. The date of the final versions of the book (Greek and Hebrew) can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the Masoretic (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Griffin is the surname of the story's protagonist. His {{name is not}} {{mentioned}} until about halfway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> Consumed with his greed for power and fame, he is the model of science without humanity. A gifted young student, he becomes interested in the science of refraction. During his experiments, he accidentally discovers chemicals (combined with an unspecified kind of radiation) that would make living tissue invisible. Obsessed with his discovery, he tries the experiment on himself and becomes invisible. However, {{he does not know}} how to reverse the process, and he slowly discovers that the advantages of being invisible do not outweigh the disadvantages and the problems he faces. Thus begins his downfall as he takes the road to crime for his survival, revealing in the process his lack of conscience, inhumanity and complete selfishness. He progresses from obsession to fanaticism, to insanity, and finally to his fateful end.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} the author said that [...] "the {{book is about}} people, not cultural dynamics. I walked through all of these cultures <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> I read, and I tried to translate abstract scholarship into people".|$|R

500|$|The book {{is partly}} fictional, as well: Sarmiento draws on his {{imagination}} {{in addition to}} historical fact in describing Rosas. In Facundo, Sarmiento outlines his argument that Rosas's dictatorship is {{the main cause of}} Argentina's problems. [...] The themes of barbarism and savagery that run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> are, to Sarmiento, consequences of Rosas's dictatorial government. [...] To make his case, Sarmiento often has recourse to strategies drawn from literature.|$|E

500|$|The story often delves {{into the}} characters' sexuality, {{including}} homosexual relations {{such as that}} of Riri and Maricela, the daughter of Luba, one of the central characters in Hernandez's Palomar stories. [...] The pair have run away from Palomar, where Maricela had endured physical abuse from her mother, and where the pair had to hide their relationship. [...] In the US they are freer to express their affections openly, but must instead hide their illegal immigrant status and avoid [...] (the immigration authorities), another theme that runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> [...] The Los Angeles setting and themes of punk rock and ethnic and sexual relations are central in the Locas stories of Hernandez's brother Jaime as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the first episode of the series was positive. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, Winter is Coming' is an introduction to a wonderfully bleak journey that honors its source material with stellar execution and an impressive cast." [...] James Poniewozik from Time considered it an [...] "epic win", and Jace Lacob from The Daily Beast deemed it [...] "unforgettable". HitFix's Alan Sepinwall wrote that while it was too early to say if Game of Thrones belonged to the HBO pantheon with shows like The Sopranos or The Wire, it had many things in common with those shows. IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that the pilot [...] "effortlessly takes us along, faithfully, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> but it also manages to capture the majestically morbid spirit of Martin's pages and turn them into thrilling television".|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} {{opposition}} to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> – Claude's moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card. Pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2. [...] The lyrics to [...] "Three-Five-Zero-Zero", which is sung during that sequence, evoke the horrors of war ("ripped open by metal explosion"). [...] The song is based on Allen Ginsberg's 1966 poem, [...] "Wichita Vortex Sutra". [...] In the poem, General Maxwell Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month, repeating it digit by digit, for effect: [...] "Three-Five-Zero-Zero." [...] The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number, echoing Maxwell's glee at reporting the enemy casualties, as the tribe chants [...] "Take weapons up and begin to kill". [...] The song also includes the repeated phrase [...] "Prisoners in niggertown/ It's a dirty little war".|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{interview}} with Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker, Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons {{said that he}} thought the time had passed to make a Watchmen movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a Watchmen movie was during {{the success of the}} 1989 Batman film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told Neon magazine that he was [...] " [...] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book". Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like The Prisoner. When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse. Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted. He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicized the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled Watching the Watchmen. Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship. Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on. Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details.|$|E
500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2 was {{directed}} by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for The Steadfast Tin Soldier from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy flipped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and found the story's structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a [...] "timeless" [...] feel, while keeping the colors [...] "as romantic as possible" [...] during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina {{was used as a}} guide for the toy ballerina's movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly {{due to the lack of}} reference material available to the team.|$|E
