Twenty trees were randomly sampled from a slow-growth category, and twenty others from a fast-growth category. The hypothesis under testing is fourfold: increased tree growth rate may affect 1) the intra-ring weighted frequency distribution of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> 2) the inter-ring variation (from pith to bark) of the parameters describing this frequency distribution, 3) the interring variation of the mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> and 4) the correlation between yearly mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> and yearly ring width. Prior to hypothesis testing, a Gaussian non-linear model with two parameters, mu (central tendency) and sigma(2) (dispersion), was found to fit adequately the intra-ring weighted frequency distribution of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> As the estimates of mu and sigma(2) increased from pith to bark (with an exponential relationship between sigma(2) and mu), so did the yearly mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> Differences between growth categories in the three variables (i. e., mu- and sigma(2) -estimates, mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length)</b> were not significant, although the difference in mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> was constant in magnitude and sign over rings.

An additional 7 samples were taken at 5 internode intervals (5 growth layers) from the 10 th to the 40 th internodes of 3 trees with average basic densities.

Specifically, the effects of environ-ment, genetics and growth rate were individually evaluated, as well as possible correlations between <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> specific gravity, tree height and tree diameter. It was found that both genetic and environmental effects were important factors in the total variation of specific gravity and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> From this study, it appears that the environ-mental component of variation is considerably greater than the genetic component of variation. From a comparison of tracheid lengths in adjacent rings ex-hibiting a growth ring width differential, it was found that an in-creased growth rate resulted in a decreased <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> (Degree) (Major) CHARACTERISTICS ON TEACHEID LENGTH AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY VARIATION Though highly significant, this decrease in <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> was quite small.

40|$|Wood {{properties}} in forest trees have great variation which {{is controlled by}} the environmental factors and the hereditary factors, within and among trees. Therefore, if the variation is controlled mainly by the hereditary factors, the breeding for wood properties should be possible. The objects of this study are to investigate the variation patterns of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> in a tree at experiment 1, and stand variations and individual tree variation of ring width and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> as wood properties at experiment 2. /Experiment 1. Variation within a tree/ The materials for this experiment were taken from HINOKI (Chamaecyparis obtuse Sieb. et Zucc.) tree growing in Kasuya school forest of Kyushu University. The survey was made to determine the variation of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> The disks for this experiment were cut from the sample tree at different heights above the ground level (at 0 m, 1 m, 1. 3 m, and every 2 m higher up to the top). Test specimens were taken from the disks at each growth ring along the four directions from the pith. There were variations of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> in the radial directions and the same growth layers, but not among the four directions. The diagram of distribution of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> in the stem (Fig. 5) was made from the data. As the result, it is possible to estimate <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> of the sample trees by small samples extracted from the stem between 1 m and 3 m above the ground level. /Experiment 2. Variation among trees and stands/ Stand variation and tree variation in ring width and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> were assessed from small samples in trees belonging to four different stands in Taira and Unzen ranger districts of Nagasaki district forest office. Significant differences at 1 percent level in ring width and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> were found among stands. As to variation among trees, the significant difference in ring width was not found in the II stand, but such differences were significant at 1 percent level in the other stands. On the other hand, significant differences in <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> were found among trees in each stand. An attempt was made to find the relation between growth characters and wood properties. These relations were shown in Table 6 and Figs. 8 and 11. Ring width and diameter at breast height were closely related. Ring width was found to have a high correlation with tree height and stem taperness. There was a significant correlation between tree height and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> However, diameter at breast height or stem taperness were not recognized to have a significant correlation with <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> The relation between ring width and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> had no significant correlation. The fact that the trees within the same stand had high variability in <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> suggests the possibility of hereditary variation among trees. 林木の材質は個体内および個体間で大きく変異している. そして,それは環境因子と遺伝因子に支配されている. もしその変異が遺伝因子に大きく影響を受けているならば材質育種も可能である. 本研究では実験 1 として,仮道管長の個体内変異を調べ,実験 2 で材質指標として,年輪幅と仮道管長をとりあげ林分間および個体間の変異について調べた. /実験 1 個体内変異/ 九大粕屋演習林のヒノキ 1 個体を用いて,その各地上高別の円板をとり,方位,年輪および地上高別の仮道管長変異の状態を調べて,ヒノキ樹幹内の仮道管長分布図を作成し,個体間および林分間の変異を調べるための試料採取部位は,胸高部位での成熟材部が最も良いとの結果を得た. /実験 2 個体間および林分間変異/ 長崎営林署管内の 4 つのヒノキ林分を調べて,年輪幅および仮道管長の林分間変異および個体間変異を調べた. それによると,林分間では,年輪幅および仮道管長において 1 %水準で有意差があり,環境の影響が十分考えられる. また個体間では年輪幅においてIIの林分だけが有意差はなく,他の林分ではいずれも 1 %水準で有意差があり,仮道管長においてはIIの林分だけが 5 %水準で,他の林分(I,III,IV) では 1 %水準でそれぞれ有意な差が認められ,個体間でもかなりの変異があることが認められた. 各林分の個体の年輪幅および仮道管長と生長指標としての樹高,胸高直径,幹の完満度との相関関係を調べると,年輪幅は胸高直径と最も高い相関があり(r= 0. 7157),樹高(r= 0. 4935) および幹の完満度(r=- 0. 4489) とも有意な相関があつた. また仮道管長は樹高と有意な相関(r= 0. 5599) が見られたが,胸高直径および幹の完満度との間には認められなかつた. また年輪幅と仮道管長との間には成熟材部においては著しい関係はないものと思われた. なお,同一林分内における個体間で,仮道管長が著しく変異している個体が見出されたが,これは遺伝因子によるものであると示唆される...|$|E

40|$|Eleven sugi cultivars in 20 -year-old stands were sampled to {{quantify}} the tracheid lengths for juvenile wood and mature wood. Tracheid lengths of latewood were estimated from macerated tissue in every ring at the breast height of three to five trees in each cultivar.

The wood density and volume shrinkage content are higher in the mature wood while <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> is taller. After determining the age of transition (24 yr), the relationship between <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> and ring width and also between the wood density and volume shrinkage were investigated in the juvenile and mature wood by linear regression.

Sugi trees with wider spacing continued tracheid formation in late season with smaller amounts of IAA, although the trees with narrower spacing ceased tracheid formation with larger amounts of IAA. Cambial growth cessation in late season might be controlled not by IAA amount, but by short-day-induced insensitivity to IAA.

40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter fiber-tracheid pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest fiber-tracheid diameter, and the largest ratio of fiber-tracheid to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, fiber-tracheid length, and the ratio of fiber <b>tracheid</b> to vessel-element <b>length</b> were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, fiber-tracheid diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. Tangential expansion of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of cambial zones, which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The normal increment of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, central mother cells, peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly. Systematic implications are summarized and a tentative phyllogeny of the Phytolaccaceae is given...|$|R

Since the data were chronologies (i. e., time series of yearly measurements), time had to be considered as a factor (i. e., the calendar year of ring formation) in the statistical analysis of the within-tree variation (repeated measures analysis of variance). While the effects of the growth category and its interaction with the year were highly significant after first thinning for ring width, a significant decrease in the wood density of fast-grown trees was observed in many years during that growing period; the decrease was small in magnitude, once averaged over years (- 0. 033 g/cm(3)). Tracheids were longer for the slow-grown trees after first thinning; although constant in sign and magnitude over years, the difference in mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> between growth categories was not statistically significant. In summary, increasing the growth rate in circumference of Norway spruce from 1. 7 to 2. 7 cm/year by heavy thinnings induced a limited decrease in wood density and mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length.</b> These results support the statement that stand productivity might be improved without sensible loss of wood quality...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Intensive {{management}} of young-growth Douglas-fir plantations has emphasized volume growth over wood quality. A {{better understanding of}} the variables that affect wood quality is needed so that wood quality and stand yield can be systematically combined into a silviculture program. This experiment utilized two separate experiments to establish the relationship bebtwen wood quality, stand density, and artificial pruning. The influence of initial stand density on branch diameter, wood density, and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> was explored utilizing 56 trees, 19 and 21 years old, at two sites in central western Oregon. Trees were sampled from Nelder plots ranging in density from 309 trees/ha to 18, 730 trees/ha. The effects of fixed-height pruning on wood density and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> were investigated using trees 23, 26, and 28 years old, after ten years of growth following pruning. Mean branch diameter, maximum branch diameter, number of branches/m, longevity of radial branch growth, and longevity of terminal branch growth all increased with decreasing initial tree density. After accounting for initial tree density, 1 : 2 rectangularity of spacing did not affect indicators of wood quality relative to 1 : 1 rectangularity of spacing. When age was held constant, {{there was no evidence that}} either wood density or <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> at breast height varied with initial tree density or crown characteristics. In contrast, there was evidence that ring density, earlywood density, and percent latewood increased linearly with initial tree density at the 5. 27 m sampling height. There was no significant change in growth rate or wood density at breast height (1. 37 m) or 5. 27 m as a result of pruning 15...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{variability}} of fl uid permeability of wood {{in general and of}} western hemlock in particular is of signifi cant importance to the primary and secondary wood products processing industry of coastal British Columbia. For the purpose of this study, ten hemlock trees were randomly selected and specimens were prepared from three tree heights from each tree, namely, 1, 4 and 7 m. The air permeability of sapwood and heartwood in the longitudinal direction was measured using a dynamic method. Tracheid lengths were also obtained with a fi ber quality analyzer and densities were measured by water displacement. The effect of tree height, <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> and density on the specifi c permeabi-lity of gross wood was then evaluated. The data revealed that height within the range measured has no effect on longitudinal permeability on heartwood whereas in sapwood the longitudinal permeability in-creases above 4 m of tree height. It was also found that longitudinal permeability was not signifi cantly infl uenced by the <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> and wood density...|$|E

A large, {{localised}} diameter growth response occurred which was linearly related to the logarithm of the concentration applied. The growth response was due to increased cell division.

40|$|Increment {{core and}} wood disc samples were {{collected}} from 10 Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) trees in each of four age-classes in Kaingaroa State Forest in the central North Island. The samples represented (a) young thinnings (12 yr), (b) two stands which had received silvicultural treatments (24 and 34 yr), and (c) an unthinned old-crop stand (52 yr). Intensive measure-ments were made of green density, basic density, moisture content, <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> and resin content. Over the 40 -year age span covered, the average wood properties changed considerably, e. g., green density 1025 - 815 kg/m 3, basic density 325 - 420 kg/m 3, moisture content 215 - 95 %, <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> 2. 5 - 3. 5 mm, resin content 3. 3 - 2. 9 %. Average values were calculated for sawlogs, top logs, sawn timber, and slabwood. It is concluded that the change in raw material supply from untended old-crop to thinnings and produce from intensively managed stands will be accompanied by age-related changes in intrinsic wood properties, to which industry will have to adjust. For instance, logs will be heavier because of a higher average moisture content, but will nevertheless have a lower basic density...|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} {{differences}} between juvenile and mature wood, 12 aged sample trees from two areas of Nagano Prefecture were harvested; and the radial development of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> the ring density, and {{the relation of the}} radial growth rate (observed by ring width) with some selected indices of ring structure were investigated. The results proved that the radial variation of <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> with ring number can be described by a logarithmic formula, and both plantations reached the demarcation of juvenile and mature wood at age 18. With the segmented regression method, we also analyzed radial variation of mean density and found that the demarcation of juvenile and mature wood was at age 15 for sample trees from Saku and at age 21 for those from Yabuhara. By using the results of estimates from juvenile and mature wood based on ring density, we found that high growth rates resulted when producing lower-density wood during the juvenile period, but these rates did not occur during the mature period. The basic reason for this phenomenon is the variation in patterns of earlywood and latewood in juvenile and mature wood, respectively. This result advised us that when managing plantations of Japanese larch it is necessary to take different measurements at different growth periods.|$|E
40|$|Estimations of {{transition}} age (TA) and juvenile wood proportion (JWP) {{are important for}} wood industries due to their impact on end-product quality. However, the relationships between analytical determination of TA based on <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> (TL) and recognized thresholds for adequate end products {{have not yet been}} established. In this study, we used three different statistical models to estimate TA in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) based on TL radial variation. We compared the results with technological maturity. A two-millimeter threshold, previously suggested for good paper tear strength, was used. <b>Tracheid</b> <b>length</b> increased from pith to bark and from breast height to upper height. Juvenile wood (JW) was conical with the three models. At breast height, TA ranged from 11 to 27 years and JWP ranged from 15. 3 % to 47. 5 % across the three models. The linear mixed model produced more conservative estimates than the maximum-quadratic-linear (M_Q_L) model. Both the linear mixed model and the M_Q_L model produced more conservative TA estimates than the piecewise model. TA estimates by the MIXED model, {{and to a lesser extent}} by the M_Q_L model, were equivalent to those for real mature wood, whereas TA estimates by the piecewise model were considerably lower, falling into the transition wood area...|$|E

Don plus trees, and their wood properties were examined. The objectives were to establish the extent of any possible shift in average wood properties caused by intensive selection for growth rate and stem straightness, and to estimate genetic parameters (variances, narrow-sense heritabilities, and genetic correlations). Samples were also collected from control trees, representing a "felling select " seedlot, within the same progeny trial. Properties examined included growth rate, wood density, and resin content (all by five-ring core segments), heartwood percentage and compression wood rating (whole cores), and <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> (outerwood only). Although wood density was variable (coefficient of variation about 0. 07), the average for the progenies overall was almost identical {{to that of the}} control trees. On the other hand, there were slight indications that, along with the improved growth rate of the progenies, compression wood and heartwood resin content levels increased whereas <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> decreased. Heritability estimates for all the actual wood properties were high, ranging from 0. 4 upwards, and coefficients of variation for resin content variables and heartwood content were very high (0. 4 or higher), suggesting good prospects for genetic manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We used a Bayesian {{hierarchical}} model to ana-lyze {{the variation in}} xylem anatomy, hydraulic properties, {{and the relationship between}} anatomy and properties within Douglas-fir trees. The hierarchical scales in our study in-cluded fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), trees within the treatments, and positions within the trees. We measured tracheid diameter, <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> percent late-wood, number of pits per cell, density, and specific conduc-tivity (Ks) on seven positions in each of 16 fertilized and 16 unfertilized trees: the trunk at cambial age 52 (breast height), 25, and 5; a branch at cambial age 20 and 7; and a root at cambial age 42 and 22. Vulnerability to embolism was also measured on the oldest trunk, branch, and root positions. For any measurement, there was little variation between treat-ments, however, there was great variation among positions. Tracheid diameter, <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> number of pits per cell, Ks, and vulnerability to embolism decreased vertically from the roots to the branches. Correlations were evident between some positions for tracheid diameter, percent earlywood, pits per cell, and vulnerability to embolism, mostly in the fertilized treatment.

40|$|Several {{important}} {{characteristics such}} as density, acoustic velocity, modulus of elasticity and tracheid dimensions are examined in stemwood, branchwood and rootwood in young (age 3 and 7) Pinus radiata. Stemwood air-dry density decreases little from ground level {{to the top of}} the tree falling gradually from 415 kg/m³ to 405 kg/m³. Branchwood air-dry density is higher than stemwood density. The branchwood density is approximately 480 kg/m³ close to the stem and then decreases sharply to ca. 410 kg/m³ near the branch tips. Rootwood density at 12 % moisture content is similar to stemwood density ranging between 420 and 405 kg/m³. Density varies from stemroot junction to root tip in lateral roots (420 to 405 kg/m³) but changes little along tap roots (405 kg/m³) In stemwood, the air-dry modulus of elasticity increases from ground level (ca. 2. 5 - 3. 5 GPa) to approximately 4 metres (ca. 5. 5 - 6. 5 GPa) and then decreases thereafter to 7 metres (ca. 2. 5 - 3. 5 GPa). The air-dry MOE of branchwood decreases linearly with tree height up the stem from approximately 4. 5 GPa at 1 metre to 3 GPa at 6 metres. Roots are the least stiff part of the tree. The air-dry MOE value decreases along roots from the stem-root junction (ca. 1. 9 GPa) to the root tip area (0. 5 GPa) in lateral roots, and from 1. 4 GPa to 0. 4 GPa in tap roots. In stemwood and rootwood the tracheid dimensions change with distance from ground level in both directions with significant different patterns. For stemwood, the <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> decreases with height up the stem. The mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> is approximately 1. 70 mm at breast height whereas it is 1. 55 mm and 1. 40 mm at 2. 4 metres and 4. 6 metres respectively. Rootwood tracheids are much longer (nearly double) than stemwood tracheids. The <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> increases with increasing distances from the stem-root junction. The mean <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> adjacent to the stemroot junction area is approximately 2. 2 mm whereas for the middle and root tip areas it is 2. 6 mm and 3. 3 mm respectively. Compression wood is a common feature of stem and branchwood. However, this atypical tissue is absent in roots except in some restricted instances where compression wood extends a short distance from the stem down into the root. Branchwood in green condition can be used to predict volume-weighted stemwood qualities at 12 % moisture content when specific conditions are applied (select a straight portion of first branch segment from the largest diameter branch at breast height, R 2 = 0. 64). However, this approach has little practical appeal as equally good or better correlations can be obtained using Fakopp on standing trees (R 2 = 0. 75). Therefore future work should focus solely on the use of time of flight instruments such as Fakopp on stemwood...|$|E
30|$|To meet {{objective}} (1)—assess {{variations of}} wood {{properties in the}} rings from juvenile to mature—the <b>tracheid</b> <b>length,</b> MFA, and density of each tree were measured from the second logs. The 20 -cm-length edge grain boards with the pith in the center were cut into three parts, in the longitudinal direction. Latewood <b>tracheid</b> <b>length</b> (TL) was measured from small specimens cut from the latewood of every three rings from pith to bark {{on one side of}} edge grain specimens. The small specimens were macerated for measurement of TL. Density was measured from 9 to 12 small specimens of edge grain wood cut from pith to bark continuously on each side. Heartwood extractives were removed by immersing samples in methanol (72  h, room temperature) and hot water (48  h, 90  °C). Density was calculated from green volume and kiln dry weight. Variation in density was measured from pith to bark on both sides. In this study, basic density is simply described as “density”. MFA of the tangential wall was measured from 24 -μm-thick tangential sections cut from latewood of every 3 – 5 rings from pith to bark on one side of edge grain specimens. MFA was measured by the iodine-staining method [27]. I 2 crystallizes in gaps between microfibrils and sections were observed with a light microscope. On light microscopy, MFA was measured using image analysis software (Image J [28]). MFA of each ring was obtained by averaging the MFA of 30 latewood tracheids.|$|E

Samples came from the following positions: bole, 30 cm aboveground; branch, 30 cm outward on the lowest live branch, and root, 1 – 3 m from the bole. Average sample cambial ages were bole, 60 years; branch, 30 years; and root, 48 years. Roots and branches had higher density wood than did the bole at the positions studied, and roots had the longest tracheids followed by the bole and then the branches. All three positions exhibited juvenile wood but with different radial patterns. All positions had their highest density near the pith, which was followed by a steep decline in the boles and a more gradual decline in the roots and branches. Boles and roots, but not branches, then showed an increase in density after this decline. Boles and branches had short tracheids near the pith followed by a gradual increase to an asymptotic value.
