The study also aimed to contribute in providing information about how the Provincial office of the Northern Province is managing OBE teacher training. The literature review covered both materials in the Provincial, National and other countries. The study's research methodology was qualitative, which includes interviews, observation and case study based. Interviews were scheduled with Provincial, Regional, District Dept officials, Educators and Principals. The study has revealed that Region 4 cannot manage the implementation of OBE teacher training properly and effectively due to constrains such as lack of transport, insufficient <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>trainer</b> facilitators and educators, et cetera.

30|$|The {{articles}} {{presented in}} this study describe a variety of guidance practices utilized at the workplace, but also present some limitations in their use {{due to lack of}} resources or guidance awareness at workplaces. It seems that techniques that are more trainer-led and easily carried out in the everyday work flow are in more frequent use, whereas techniques that require more time, reciprocality and activity from the community and learner see less frequent use., Smith (2000) for example, states that workplaces do not encourage the use of exploration because of the risk it will interfere with the company’s production schedules and cause problems with workplace safety. Moreover, workplaces may already have established certain ways of doing things, and any experimenting outside these established methods may evoke an unfavorable response. When it comes to reflection, it has been proved hard for teachers to act upon the initiatives for reflection made by students at everyday work situations (Wegener 2013). Formal <b>training</b> <b>for</b> workplace <b>trainers</b> may also affect the chosen methods of guidance. Some studies (Evanciew and Rojewski 1999; Reegård 2015) suggest that trainers can provide guidance for learners efficiently without any formal training, whereas others (Filliettaz 2011; Smith 2000) find that structured <b>training</b> <b>for</b> workplace <b>trainers</b> improves the quality of workplace guidance. Nielsen (2008) and Reegård (2015) note that the independence given to learners may also sometimes result from insufficient resources for guidance rather than from intentional pedagogic strategies.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to evaluate <b>Training</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trainers</b> (T 4 T) {{as an aid}} for developing healthy and sustained church planting movements (CPMs). The thesis is that <b>Training</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trainers</b> (T 4 T) can enable and sustain (by the Spirit’s power) healthy church planting movements because a discipleship process {{is built into the}} methodology that develops believers in their personal and communal growth and equips them to repeat the process with other individuals they reach. The very format of the T 4 T process provides a context for developing disciples inwardly and training disciples to minister outwardly. The T 4 T process continues over the course of months and years to systematically move believers through the essential stages of sustained church planting movements: Bridges in conversations with the lost from non-spiritual topics to the gospel in order to find those God is preparing (knowing whom to talk to and how to start) • Reproducible evangelism methods that are effective in the local context and can be learned by any new believer • Reproducible discipleship that addresses both short-term and long-term spiritual growth in a manner appropriate to the local worldview and able to be passed on by a new believer • Reproducible church models appropriate to the local context and able to be led and passed on by new believers • Leadership development and multiplication patterns that develop leaders rapidly in the context of ministry and enable the number of leaders {{to keep pace with the}} number of new churches. T 4 T moves each new generation of disciples (trainers) and churches through this process because it casts vision for and gives loving accountability for disciples to truly become trainers of others. It does this primarily through a three-thirds training process. T 4 T is <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>trainers</b> who will train trainers who will train trainers. T 4 T {{attempts to}} initiate movements of God in which at least four generations of new disciples and churches emerge.

40|$|Training {{initiatives}} are universal phenomena, particularly in developing nations, {{which have been}} using training {{as a part of}} their overall development efforts. This research aims to identify and investigate the factors that influence the quality of training programmes in training centres in Jordanian public universities. It is an explanatory study which focuses on explaining how and why the factors influence training practices. This study has been conducted by adopting a case study strategy and a qualitative approach. The data were gathered by using semi-structured interviews as the main data collection instrument within two training centres in two Jordanian public universities. Additionally, a number of data collection instruments were used in order to achieve triangulation, and to fully understand the training practices in the two case study organisations (CSOs). In total, 16 trainers and 12 training programme coordinators and training administrators were interviewed. The research reveals that there is an absence of: systematic trainer selection processes, a training design approach, training evaluation systems, trainee selection, involvement of major parties in training design and evaluation, and a lack of variation in methods used in delivering training programmes. The study reveals that there is an absence of systematic institutional efforts regarding <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>trainers,</b> training coordinators and administrators in both CSOs. Contributions to knowledge on the academic and practical levels are evident with the research being the first explanatory attempt to empirically investigate the key factors which influence the training programmes in training centres in Jordanian public universities. Thus, it provides a deep understanding of the current training practices and management in training centres in two Jordanian public universities. This is because previous studies focussing on training were mainly undertaken in different cultural contexts from that of Jordan. The findings of this study have added to the existing literature by extending knowledge regarding training practices in a new context. Practically, the study has significant implications for both practitioners and decision makers, such as: the need to establish systematic trainer and trainee selection processes; continuous development and <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>trainers</b> and administrators; adoption of standardised procedures for designing training programmes; developing appropriate methods for the evaluation of training programmes; enhancing quality awareness of quality in training; and establishing a formal body to organise and control training institutions in Jordan.

30|$|Building on this {{momentum}} {{in favour of}} English, the 2003 National Education Commission emphasised on learning English from the primary level. It declared {{that one of the}} fundamental objectives of primary education was to acquaint students with the English language, and to achieve primary skills and use English as a useful foreign language. However the Commission was not in favour of using any particular book for the students in Classes 1 and 2; rather they recommended rebuilding the overall English curriculum. In order to improve English education, this Commission suggested organising overseas <b>training</b> <b>for</b> <b>trainers</b> in the Primary Teachers Institute (PTI) and the National Academy for Primary Education (NAPE), as well as local training programs for all secondary school teachers. The Commission found that there was no clear understanding of the objectives of ‘communicative English’ among secondary level teachers and therefore it proposed stressing on English grammar from Class 6. As for higher education, the Commission found that {{in the absence of a}} national language policy and the dilemma regarding which language to use in higher education, students remained weak in both Bengali and English. To this end, the Commission proposed to introduce a six-month English and Bengali language course for all undergraduate students to improve their language skills.|$|E
