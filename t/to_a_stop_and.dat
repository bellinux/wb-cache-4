5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|The next spring, a revitalized army {{emerged from}} Valley Forge in good order, {{thanks in part}} to a {{full-scale}} training program supervised by General von Steuben. The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York in June, 1778. Washington summoned a council of war with Generals Lee, Greene, and Wayne and Lafayette, and he decided to make a partial attack on the retreating British at the Battle of Monmouth. The British were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton, Howe's successor. On June 28, Lee and Lafayette moved with 4,000 men. Without Washington's immediate knowledge they attempted to launch but bungled the first attack at the British rear guard. Clinton came about and offered stiff resistance, also with 4,000 men and waiting in anticipation, keeping the Americans in check. After sharp words of criticism, Washington relieved Lee and continued fighting to an effective draw in one of the war's largest battles. When nightfall came, the fighting came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the British continued their retreat and headed towards New York, where Washington soon moved his army just outside the city.|$|E
5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ today). He {{was involved in the}} development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E

25|$|By early 1861, settler {{opinion was}} evenly divided on Browne's stance against Māori and the {{fairness}} of the Waitara purchase and many believed the British had little hope of wearing the enemy down with further military campaigns. Even Pratt expressed doubts the war could be won. The district had also suffered great economic hardship, with emigration all but coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the destruction of three-quarters of farmhouses at Omata, Bell Block, Tataraimaka, and settlements nearer the town.|$|E

25|$|In the First World War, 13,878 {{members of}} the {{university}} served and 2,470 were killed. Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal Commission appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant. Following the Second World War, the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was {{partly due to the}} success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy {{to get over the}} top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E

Various clips were then shown from the series {{of the characters in}} action, often chasing suspects. This sequence kept the first version of [...] "Overkill", and also used the same ending credits from series one. This sequence was also used in the third series.|$|E
500|$|In 1830 {{the company}} opened new offices {{at the corner}} of Northgate and Union Street in Darlington. Between 1831 and 1832 a second track was laid between Stockton and the foot of Brusselton Bank. Workshops were built at Shildon for the {{maintenance}} and construction of locomotives. In 1830 approximately 50 horses shared the traffic with 19 locomotives, but travelled at different speeds, so to help regulate traffic horse-drawn trains were required to operate in groups of four or five. This had led to horses, startled by a passing locomotive and coming off their dandy cart, being run down by the following train. On one occasion a driver fell asleep in the dandy cart of the preceding train and his horse, no longer being led, came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> was run down by a locomotive. The rule book stated that locomotive-hauled trains had precedence over horse-drawn trains, but some horse drivers refused to give way and on one occasion a locomotive had to follow a horse-drawn train for over [...] The committee decided in 1828 to replace horses with locomotives on the main line, starting with the coal trains, but there was resistance from some colliery owners. After the S bought out the coach companies in August 1832, a mixed passenger and small goods service began between Stockton and Darlington on 7 September 1833, travelling at locomotive-hauled services began to Shildon in December 1833 and to Middlesbrough on 7 April 1834. The company had returned the five per cent dividend that had been promised by Edward Pease, and this had increased to eight per cent by the time he retired in 1832. When the treasurer Jonathan Backhouse retired in 1833 to become a Quaker minister he was replaced by Joseph Pease.|$|E

The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E

2500|$|Just after 13:00 on 29 January, Kormoran {{encountered}} a large merchantman which altered course on sighting the raider, but {{returned to her}} original heading after Kormoran made no aggressive moves. Detmers instead waited until {{the distance between the}} ships had decreased before the raider altered course to intercept, dropped her camouflage, and ordered the merchantman to stop. The ship did not comply, and after a warning shot elicited no response, Kormoran fired for effect. A distress signal was transmitted but jammed by the raider, and after unsuccessfully trying to break away from the faster German ship, the merchant vessel came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> ceased attempts to transmit.

2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E
