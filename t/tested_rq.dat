Evans includes a risk intelligence <b>test</b> (<b>RQ)</b> in his book and on his website (below) analogous to IQ or EQ.|$|R
30|$|The central {{advantage}} of Rasch-models—namely that individuals’ ability parameters are estimated {{independently of the}} tasks {{used to compare the}} individuals—is only valid if there are equal discrimination values of all items in a <b>test</b> (<b>RQ</b> 2 a). To test this, median scoresplit analyses—Andersen-Likelihood-Ratio-Tests (Andersen 1973) and Wald-Tests (Koller et al. 2012, pp. 77 – 79)—were executed, using the eRm-package belonging to the software R (version 3.1. 2; Mair and Hatzinger 2007). 3 The quality of the <b>test</b> items (<b>RQ</b> 2 b) was investigated by calculating and evaluating (i) the scaling of the individuals’ ability parameters as well as the items’ difficulty parameters, (ii) the EAP/PV (expected a posteriori/plausible values) reliability, (iii) the curve of the total test information function, and (iv) the wMNSQ (weighted Mean Square) values.|$|R
40|$|While {{relationship}} {{learning has}} been addressed in marketing theory, {{it has not}} yet been explored as a possible dimension of the second-order construct of relationship quality (RQ). This construct has so far been mostly conceptualized to consist of trust and commitment, sometimes also satisfaction; however, some see the latter more {{as a consequence of the}} former two. Additionally, while RQ and its multidimensionality have been researched in the marketing literature, this area has remained virtually unexplored in the supply and operations management literature. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the multidimensional nature of the second-order construct of RQ in a particular setting of transnational corporation (TNC) buyer-supplier relationships. Our paper aims to determine if relationship learning can be considered an important dimension of RQ, alongside trust and commitment. In our study of relationship learning, we follow Jean, Sinkovics and Kim (2010) and Jean and Sinkovics (2010), who have focused on the governance aspect of relationship learning in managing supply performance outcomes. We employ an indirect testing approach by <b>testing</b> <b>RQ</b> as a second-order reflective construct comprised of trust, commitment and relationship within a simple variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Our results confi rm that relationship learning is an important dimension of the second-order construct of RQ. This was done on a tentative sample of 11 TNC purchasing managers and 55 evaluated suppliers, albeit with some research limitations which we acknowledge. Our research calls for additional cross-validation of our tentative results...|$|R
30|$|For empirically validating the {{theoretically}} assumed {{structural model}} for CCER (RQ 1) and for examining the <b>test</b> instrument’s quality (<b>RQ</b> 2), the written students’ exams {{were analyzed using}} psychometric models belonging to the IRT. RQ 1 : Two central Rasch-models were applied—a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional Partial-Credit-Model (PCM; Masters 1982; Adams et al. 1997)—by using the software ConQuest 3.0 (Wu et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{participants}} in terms of their ability to estimate speed and distance. ADV computerized <b>test</b> developed by <b>RQ</b> Plus, is designed as a dynamic model consisting of sequences showing the evolution of three goals on three concentric orbits. The study involved a total of 96 subjects - practitioners of individual sports (tennis, gymnastics, karate, taekwondo), team sports (football, handball, basketball) and non-practitioners. Using one-way ANOVA has proven significant differences in the ratio (p < 0. 05) between subjects concerning the performance achieved when measuring speed and distance...|$|R
30|$|The curated dataset {{was used}} to answer the {{previously}} stated research questions. In step 7 (Fig.  5), to answer RQ 3 and RQ 6, we used descriptive statistics, supported by graphs presenting different perspectives of our data. In some cases, some attributes were used to compare hyperspecialists and non-specialists. In these cases, we used the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistical test, given {{that it is a}} nonparametric test that does not require the assumption of normal distributions. We also made use of the effect size test called Cliff-delta to compare the groups. For the other RQs (RQ 4 and RQ 5), we used the Spearman correlation test since, once again, our data did not follow a normal distribution. For RQ 4, we compare the number of challenges and the number of participants per technology. Similarly, we used the correlation <b>test</b> on <b>RQ</b> 5 to compare the number of participants and the number of specialists per challenge.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study {{consists}} of analyzing the existing correlations between the resistance to mental fatigue and the performance obtained by gymnasts in a competition. The computerized test RNE (Resistance to Mental Fatigue RNE Test), within PSISELTEVA <b>tests,</b> elaborated by <b>RQ</b> Plus, has been conceived in order to evaluate the resistance to mental fatigue. The subjects who took part in this study are 8 junior gymnasts, from C. S. S. 7 Dinamo Bucharest. Using the Spearman correlation there have been important relations highlighted between the performance coefficient (appreciated through the rapport between the vigilance and the simple reaction time) and the mark obtained in the competition for the following apparatus: rings, parallel bars and horizontal bar...|$|R
40|$|During mate choice, {{individuals}} are predicted to assess traits that honestly signal {{the quality of}} potential partners. Locomotor capacity may be such a trait, potentially signalling condition and ability to resist oxidative damage. In this study, we experimentally manipulated nutritional status: Male wild-type budgerigars, imported from Australia, were provided with either an enhanced (EQ) or reduced quality (RQ) diet varying in vitamin (particularly retinol and a-tocopherol) and mineral levels. Then, we assessed whether this influenced locomotor capacity, i. e. escape flight performance, and sexual attractiveness in male budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus. Males in the EQ group showed significantly greater total antioxidant capacity and higher blood plasma concentrations of the dietary antioxidants retinol and a-tocopherol, but not carotenoids, than the RQ group. Over 8 weeks of flight training, males on the EQ diet showed significantly greater improvement on the most strenuous flight <b>test</b> than <b>RQ</b> males. In mate choice trials, females preferred EQ over RQ males. EQ males that were relatively fast in escape flight trials were more strongly preferred in the mate preference arena than their RQ competitors. Interestingly, males with high plasma carotenoid levels flew slower and were less attractive than males with low carotenoid levels. This might indicate that carotenoids are not effective antioxidants in birds. Overall, our results show that dietary-derived antioxidants can influence sexual attractiveness and other fitness-related traits through multiple pathways. Locomotor capacity {{appears to be an}} honest signal of male condition in birds...|$|R
40|$|Vision is {{important}} for postural control as is shown by the Romberg quotient (RQ) : with eyes closed, postural instability increases relative to eyes open (RQ =  2). Yet while fixating at far distance, postural stability is similar with eyes open and eyes closed (RQ =  1). Postural stability can be better with both eyes viewing than one eye, but such effect is not consistent among healthy subjects. The first goal {{of the study is}} to <b>test</b> the <b>RQ</b> as a function of distance for children with convergent versus divergent strabismus. The second goal is to test whether vision from two eyes relative to vision from one eye provides better postural stability. Thirteen children with divergent strabismus and eleven with convergent strabismus participated in this study. Posturtography was done with the Techno concept device. Experiment 1, four conditions: fixation at 40 cm and at 200 cm both with eyes open and eyes covered (evaluation of RQ). Experiment 2, six conditions: fixation at 40 cm and at 200 cm, with both eyes viewing or under monocular vision (dominant and non-dominant eye). For convergent strabismus, the groups mean value of RQ was 1. 3 at near and 0. 94 at far distance; for divergent, it was 1. 06 at near and 1. 68 at far. For all children, the surface of body sway was significantly smaller under both eyes viewing than monocular viewing (either eye). Increased RQ value at near for convergent and at far for divergent strabismus is attributed to the influence of the default strabismus angle and to better use of ocular motor signals. Vision with the two eyes improves postural control for both viewing distances and for both types of strabismus. Such benefit can be due to complementary mechanisms: larger visual field, better quality of fixation and vergence angle due to the use of visual inputs from both eyes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{rolling contact}} fatigue four-ball tests were {{performed}} on Hot Isostatically Pressed (HIPed) silicon nitride/steel contacts under lubricated condition using a PLINT TE 92 /HS Microprocessor Controlled Rotary Tribometer at a maximum compressive stress of 6. 58 GPa and at a speed of 10, 000 rpm for 135 ~ 200 million stress cycles. Rolling track surfaces were examined by optical microscopy, SEM, 3 -D surface analysis, atomic force microscopy and interference profilometry. Experimental results show that with a initial roughness value Ra from 0. 016 to 0. 094 µm, the surfaces became smoother during testing and surface pitting (10 ~ 20 µm) occurred. For the surfaces with a roughness value Ra from 0. 002 to 0. 008 µm, the surfaces became rougher and lubricant oil residues were deposited {{at the edges of}} rolling track. Some small and shallow surface pitting 2 ~ 3 µm in size was also observed. Some scratch marks left on the surface by the previous lapping process were further extended during <b>testing.</b> Ra and <b>Rq</b> are still most important roughness parameters in relation to rolling contact behaviour. The effects of other surface roughness parameters, such as the shape of the valley, Rsk and Rku are not obvious in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the paper is to reanalyze the results of {{previous}} studies on the repeated question effect in the conservation task, {{and to create a}} more direct test of the repeated question (RQ) hypothesis (repeating of question in the conservation task may mislead concrete-operational children to give the wrong answer since they interpret the repeating as an implicit sign that their first answer is wrong). Reanalysis of previous studies shows that some original conclusions need to be modified, and that a more direct <b>test</b> of the <b>RQ</b> hypothesis is needed. Each participant (N= 58, mean age 7; 10) was tested by two tasks (conservation of liquid), a standard and modified version. In the modified task, liquid was poured into the same glass, so that the child’s answer was not under influence of his or her level of cognitive development, but only by the repeated question (child who was misled by the RQ would give a wrong answer). According to the RQ hypothesis, children who change their answer on the modified task also need to change their answer on the standard task. Moreover, children who resist the RQ on the standard task do not need to change their answer on the modified task. Results show a different pattern than expected by the RQ hypothesis...|$|R
