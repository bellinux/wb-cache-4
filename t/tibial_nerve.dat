25|$|The {{sciatic nerve}} {{supplies}} sensation {{to the skin}} of the foot, as well as the entire lower leg (except for its inner side). Sensation to skin to the sole of the foot is provided by the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve,</b> and the lower leg and upper surface of the foot via the common fibular nerve.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the obturator nerve, {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve.</b> The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the pes anserinus. It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the lesser trochanter and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior ramus of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior ramus of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other reaches down to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E

2500|$|The nerves of the sacral plexus pass {{behind the}} hip joint to {{innervate}} the posterior {{part of the}} thigh, most of the lower leg, and the foot. [...] The superior (L4-S1) and inferior gluteal nerves (L5-S2) innervate the gluteus muscles and the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S1-S3) contributes sensory branches to the skin on the posterior thigh. [...] The sciatic nerve (L4-S3), the largest and longest nerve in the human body, leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. In the posterior thigh it first gives off branches to the short head of the biceps femoris and then divides into the tibial (L4-S3) and common fibular nerves (L4-S2). The fibular nerve continues down on the medial side of biceps femoris, winds around the fibular neck and enters {{the front of the}} lower leg. There it divides into a deep and a superficial terminal branch. The superficial branch supplies the peroneus muscles and the deep branch enters the extensor compartment; both branches reaches into the dorsal foot. In the thigh, the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> gives off branches to semitendinosus, semimembranosus, adductor magnus, and the long head of the biceps femoris. The nerve then runs straight down the back of the leg, through the popliteal fossa to supply the ankle flexors {{on the back of the}} lower leg and then continues down to supply all the muscles in the sole of the foot.|$|E

40|$|Neurophysiological and neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that pain may {{play a major role}} in {{determining}} cortical somatosensory rearrangements even in the adult brain. The re-organizational power of pain, however, has been tested in models in which massive deafferentation co-existed with pain (e. g. in phantom pain). Moreover, information on whether spinal and brainstem changes contribute to pain-related plasticity in humans is meagre. We used the noninvasive somatosensory evoked potentials technique in patients with right primary trigeminal neuralgia and no clinical signs of large-diameter fibers of trigeminal deafferentation to assess whether pain may induce plastic changes at multiple levels in the somatosensory system. Subcortical and cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of the right median and posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves</b> ipsilateral to the facial pain were compared with those obtained following stimulation of the left median and <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves</b> and with those obtained in a control group tested in comparable conditions. Amplitudes of parietal N 20 and P 27 and frontal N 30 potentials observed following stimulation of the right median nerve ipsilateral to the facial pain were greater than those of the left median nerve and showed a positive correlation with magnitude of pain. This right-left asymmetry was absent following stimulation of the patients' <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves</b> and in control subjects. No changes were found in spinal N 13 and brainstem P 14. That facial pain is associated with neuroplastic changes within the somatic cortical representation of the hand suggests a pain-related topographic cortical reorganisation. (C) 2004 IBRO.

50|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome (TTS) {{can vary from}} patient to patient. However the same end result is true for all patients, the {{compression}} of the posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> and it branches as it travels around the medial malleolus causes pain and irritation for the patient. There are many possible causes for compression of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> therefore {{there are a variety}} of prevention strategies. One being immobilization, by placing the foot in a neutral position with a brace, pressure is relieved from the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> thus reducing patients pain. Eversion, inversion, and plantarflexion (as seen in figure 1) all can cause compression of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> therefore in the neutral position the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> is less agitated. Typically this is recommended for the patient to do while sleeping(see figure 2). Another common problem is improper footwear, having shoes deforming the foot due to being too tight can lead to increased pressure on the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Having footwear that tightens the foot for extended periods of time even will lead to TTS. Therefore, by simply having properly fitted shoes TTS can be prevented.|$|E

40|$|Pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a {{synthetic}} compound {{widely used in}} cell biological investigations, recently attracted considerable interest as a putative anticancer agent. However, different dithiocarbamates have previously shown to cause neurological symptoms and morphological alterations in peripheral nerves. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether a 15 -day oral administration with low doses of PDTC may produce adverse effects in peripheral nerves of rats. Female Wistar rats were assigned to receive PDTC [0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 mmol/(kg body weight/day) ] by gavage for 15 days. Reduced conduction velocity was observed by electrophysiological analysis in <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves</b> of treated animals, accompanied by a marked decrease in Shwann cell S 100 -protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy evaluation revealed marked myelin degeneration in the fibers of treated animals. In particular, both morphological and electrophysiological data suggested an impairment of large, fast conducting fibers, whereas the smallest and slowest ones remained intact. However, the activity of plasma and liver alkaline-phosphatase, an enzymic marker of hepatic dithiocarbamate toxicity, was not altered by the treatment. The total contents of the redox-active metal copper increased in <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves</b> of treated rats and was accompanied by raised levels of lipid peroxidation products. This finding suggests a role for oxidative stress in the development of PDTC-induced pathological and functional alterations of <b>tibial</b> <b>nerves.</b> The observation that a 15 -day treatment with low doses of PDTC causes functional and morphological derangement of peripheral nerves advices against the possible use of this compound as a chemopreventive agent against cancer...|$|R
