5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in a dancing manner; <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E

2500|$|Figure 1 (center panel). To an {{observer}} at rest on an [...] {{inertial reference frame}} (like the ground), the car will seem to accelerate. In order for <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> to stay inside the car, a force must be exerted on <b>the</b> <b>passenger.</b> This force is exerted by the seat, which has started {{to move forward with}} the car and is compressed against <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> until it transmits the full force to keep <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> moving with <b>the</b> car. Thus, the forces exerted by the seat are unbalanced,so <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> is accelerating in this frame.|$|R

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. <b>The</b> <b>passengers</b> {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue <b>the</b> <b>passengers.</b> Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|Around 00:15, the {{stewards}} began ordering <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> to put {{on their}} lifebelts, though again, many passengers took the order as a joke. Some set about playing an impromptu game of association football with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the foredeck.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Four of <b>the</b> <b>{{passengers}}</b> were Germans, {{the other}} three passengers were French, Swiss and Spanish. The three-person crew included Moldovan pilot Pavel Gruzin, Slovak copilot Rastislav Kolesár, and a French flight attendant. There were no survivors.|$|E

5|$|According to the police, <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> behaved very calmly, {{given the}} circumstances. Keč allowed several of <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> {{to use their}} mobile telephones, {{allowing}} {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E

From {{the point}} of view of the {{interior}} of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> backwards, with magnitude equal to the mass of <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> times <b>the</b> acceleration of the car. This force pushes <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> back into <b>the</b> seat, until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.|$|R
