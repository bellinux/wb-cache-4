5|$|On August 14, 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} a report regarding the incident. The report discussed several aspects of the collision, including locations of origin of the aircraft, planned destination, and air traffic control communications. In addition, the report discussed how one of the controllers at Teterboro Airport was on a phone call and did not warn the airplane pilot of the potential conflict. The National Air Traffic Controller's Union (NATCA) then issued their own press release disputing some of the phrasing in the NTSB's report. The NTSB then retracted some of its statements regarding the controller's part in the crash, saying that the controller could not have warned the plane about the tour helicopter because the tour helicopter {{was not on the}} controller's radar. The NTSB also removed NATCA as a party to <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> as a result of NATCA's press release, as parties to NTSB investigations agree to let the NTSB control publicity during <b>the</b> <b>investigation.</b> NATCA may still submit information to the board regarding the accident, but they will not hold a seat on <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> board.|$|E
