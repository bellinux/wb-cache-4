5|$|I {{knew the}} ramp in Vikersund can jump pretty darn far. It was an {{incredible}} flight and it was important <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to do it. During the flight, I thought 'it's now or never'.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> into {{something}} positive.|$|E

5|$|That week {{confined}} {{to my room}} actually saved my life. I {{had been scheduled to}} go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken.|$|E
5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
50|$|Because of <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{also able}} to state this {{fundamental}} truth <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> born of a people who are heroes and heroines.|$|R

5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E

40|$|Most philosophers, {{including}} all materialists I know of, believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a complex thing?a thing with parts?and that my mental life is (or {{is a result}} of) the interaction of these parts. These philosophers often believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a body or a brain, and my mental life is (or is a product of) brain activity. In this paper, I develop and defend a novel argument against this view. The argument turns on certainty, that highest epistemic status that a precious few of our beliefs enjoy. For example, {{on the basis of}} introspection, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not in fierce pain right now. But if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a complex thing like a body or a brain, then introspection might be a causal series of events extended in time. And any such process could go awry. So, if introspection is such a process, then I could gain good evidence that the introspective process has gone awry and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> contrary to appearances, feeling fierce pain right now. Therefore, the view <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a complex thing like a body or a brain forces open the possibility <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>be</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not feeling fierce pain right now. Since that is clearly not an open possibility, it follows <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a complex thing. I conclude by responding to three objections...|$|R
