5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|An old blind woman, {{who came}} <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Fauré play and advised Toussaint-Honoré {{to send him}} to the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music, better known as the , which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After {{reflecting}} for a year, Fauré's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> {{respond to the}} problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot study}} aims to {{investigate}} the degrees of Pidgin comprehension by Japanese learners of English, and find out whether Pidgin is easier <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> understand than Standard English. Also, it intends to examine {{the validity of the}} testing materials. Four Japanese learners of English were recruited, and they were asked to do a cloze-dictation test and a comprehension test about the listening materials. The test score analysis showed that Standard English was easier <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> to seek the word-sound correspondence, while Hawaiian Pidgin English was easier <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> identify the content. Further discussion of results and issues in testing materials will follow...|$|R

They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> demands a divorce.|$|E

Rosencrantz reveals {{that the city is}} the Gran Grimoire and its power lies at the city center: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz, confident in his immunity against Darkness, tries to force Sydney to surrender his powers. Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove that he is not a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness. Sydney refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E

In addition, there are still 400 million Chinese who are only able <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> understand Mandarin and not able to speak it. Therefore, in China's 13th Five Year Plan, the general goal is to raise the penetration rate to over 80% by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Wiring parties {{faced the}} {{constant}} {{danger of being}} noticed by enemy searchlights or troops. Enemy sentries were trained <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> look for these nighttime raiders, and any suspicious sounds or movements could give away the men's position and consequently bring a concentration of heavy fire that way. Unprotected and often standing, wiring parties were subject to enemy flares which would expose them immediately, causing them to have to lie flat, even on the very wire they were carrying.|$|E

25|$|Bush {{campaigned for}} her son George W., after his {{announcement}} of a presidential campaign in June 1999. Throughout the country, she met with women {{in support of his}} campaign, but remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejecting any criticism of her son said in her presence and refused to watch any debates, a contrast to her husband's willingness <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> his watching of every debate, creating friction between the couple.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, she {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the state temperance convention, but the chairman stopped her {{when she tried to}} speak, saying that women delegates were there only <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> learn. Anthony and some other women immediately walked out and announced a meeting of their own, which created a committee to organize a women's state convention. Largely organized by Anthony, the convention of 500 women met in Rochester in April and created the Women's State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{experimental}} Mk. VII units were beginning to arrive, the definitive Mk. VIII production version was being explored. One of the most pressing problems was the need to greatly reduce the size {{and complexity of the}} radar packaging, which almost completely filled the Beaufighter's rear section. Another issue was the desire to start using the new Sutton tubes for switching, which was expected to greatly increase the range of the system. Also desired was some way to use IFF and radio beacons with the AIS systems, as previous transponders had been deliberately designed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> respond on the original AI Mk. IV frequencies around 193MHz.|$|E

In {{the course of his}} work, he went to the Hondo Navigation Village located on the Hondo Army Airfield in Medina County, Texas. The village was owned by the United States under a Congressional program which was designed to provide housing for persons engaged in National Defense activities. According to all indications the village was freely accessible and open to the public and had the characteristics of a typical American town.|$|E
25|$|Sometime later, {{after his}} {{connection}} with the Collector was exposed, Luthor was fired {{as a consultant to}} the U.S. military by General Lane himself. Luthor explained that they had no evidence, and that they needed his expertise as their consultant. Lane refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> has Luthor thrown off the base, but Luthor was confident that he will be asked back. After Superman's encounter with the K-Man, it was revealed that Lex Luthor had {{played a major role in}} the K-Man's creation, also (as revealed in flashback), that he had stolen kryptonite crystals from the government while being employed by them. Luthor then muses about the potential uses of kryptonite on Superman.|$|E
25|$|The centre then {{realized}} that it was better for them to deal with a more competent agent, which at the time was Babrak Karmal, who later accused Nur Muhammad Taraki of taking bribes and even having secretly contacted the United States embassy in Kabul. On that, the centre again refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> instructed him to take resident position in the Kabul residency by 1974. On 30 April 1978, Taraki, despite being cut off from any support, led the coup which later became known as April Revolution, and became the country's President, along with Hafizullah Amin being Deputy-Prime Minister and Vice-President. On 5 December of that same year, Taraki compared the April Revolt to the Russian Revolution, which struck Vladimir Kryuchkov, the FCD chief of that time.|$|E

25|$|The pursuit {{did not go}} {{completely}} smoothly for Wei. Sima Yi ordered Zhang He {{to further}} pursue the enemy {{in an attempt to}} capitalise on their momentum. The Weilüe mentioned that Zhang He refused to obey Sima Yi's order and argued that, according to classical military doctrine, one should refrain from pursuing an enemy force retreating to its home territory. However, Sima Yi refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> forced Zhang He to carry out this order. Indeed, Zhang He fell into an ambush at Mumen Trail (木門道; near present-day Mumen Village, Mudan Town, Qinzhou District, Tianshui, Gansu), where Zhuge Liang had ordered crossbowmen to hide on high ground and fire at approaching enemy forces when they entered a narrow defile. Zhang He died after a stray arrow hit him in the right knee.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{returns to}} the {{remaining}} guests and Rose, who is now free of the observation room.

In the elevated temperature and without moisturising, Cassandra begins to dry out and crack. She begs for mercy from the Doctor, but he refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> Cassandra ruptures. Rose notes that with all the events that occurred no one had witnessed the actual destruction of Earth. The Doctor returns Rose to her present time, and explains {{to her that he}} is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet of Gallifrey was destroyed {{in the wake of a}} great war. The episode closes with Rose and the Doctor going off to get chips on a sunny London afternoon.|$|E
25|$|The police {{returned}} to the area but were unable to re-enter and were forced to retreat several times with heavy losses. That evening, they called upon Captain Isaiah Rynders to use his influence to stop the battle. Rynders, the political boss of the Sixth Ward, was long associated with the underworld, and {{it was thought that}} he could force them to stop. He agreed, and upon his arrival between 6:00–7:00p.m., he addressed the gangsters from the barricades. Although he tried to reason with them by telling them the futility of fighting, they refused <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> <b>and</b> Rynders was forced to escape into the company of his henchmen, when the mob responded by throwing rocks at him. He then traveled to the Metropolitan Police Headquarters where he advised Draper to call in the military. Meanwhile, fires had been set to two or three houses while residents remained under siege by looters and thugs.|$|E
