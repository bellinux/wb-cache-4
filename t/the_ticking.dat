5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of <b>the</b> <b>ticking</b> gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of <b>the</b> <b>ticking.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears <b>the</b> <b>ticking</b> of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E

[...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life <b>the</b> <b>ticking</b> time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11."

5000|$|In {{all of his}} incarnations, <b>The</b> <b>Tick</b> is {{surrounded}} by a cast of equally absurd heroes and villains, many of them parodies of popular comic book characters and character types.

2500|$|Specifically, {{application}} of methylated spirit, nail polish remover, turpentine or ti-tree oil {{is thought to}} irritate <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> and make it inject more of the noxious substances.

Application of pyrethrin (or pyrethroid) insecticides has been suggested 'as a narcotic and a toxicant, which prevents <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> from injecting its saliva' [...] but with this method <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> may remain physically attached for 24 hrs before it drops off dead.|$|R
25|$|Attached ticks {{should be}} removed promptly, as removal within 36 hours can reduce {{transmission}} rates. Folk remedies for tick removal tend to be ineffective, offer no advantages in preventing the transfer of disease, and may increase the risks of transmission or infection. The best method is simply to pull <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> out with tweezers {{as close to the}} skin as possible, without twisting, and avoiding crushing the body of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> or removing <b>the</b> head from <b>the</b> <b>tick's</b> body. <b>The</b> risk of infection increases with <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> is attached, and if a tick is attached for less than 24 hours, infection is unlikely. However, since these ticks are very small, especially in the nymph stage, prompt detection is quite difficult. The Australian Society of Clinical Immunology recommends against using tweezers to remove ticks but rather to kill <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> first by using a product to rapidly freeze <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> to prevent it from injecting more allergen-containing saliva. In a <b>tick</b> allergic person, <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> should be killed and removed in a safe place (e.g. an emergency department of a hospital).|$|R

In <b>the</b> Argasidae, <b>the</b> <b>tick's</b> cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|R

When he finally reveals himself, he and Hook fall to the climactic battle, which Peter easily wins.

40|$|Abstract Background Performing a tick check {{after visiting}} nature is {{considered}} the most important preventive measure to avoid contracting Lyme disease. Checking <b>the</b> body for <b>ticks</b> after visiting nature is the only measure that can fully guarantee whether one has been bitten by a <b>tick</b> and provides <b>the</b> opportunity to remove <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> as soon as possible, thereby greatly reducing the chance of contracting Lyme disease. However, compliance to performing <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check is low. In addition, most previous studies on determinants of preventive measures to avoid Lyme disease lack a clear definition and/or operationalization of the term “preventive measures”. Those that do distinguish multiple behaviors including <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check, fail to describe the systematic steps that should be followed in order to perform <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check effectively. Hence, {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify determinants of systematically performing <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check, based on social cognitive theory. Methods A cross-sectional self-administered survey questionnaire was filled out online by 508 respondents (Mage[*]=[*] 51. 7, SD[*]=[*] 16. 0; 50. 2 % men; 86. 4 % daily or weekly nature visitors). Bivariate correlations and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between socio-cognitive determinants (i. e. concepts related to humans’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to perform certain behavior), and <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check, and between socio-cognitive determinants and proximal goal to do <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check. Results <b>The</b> full regression model explained 28 % of the variance in doing <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check. Results showed that performing <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check was associated with proximal goal (β[*]=[*]. 23, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), self-efficacy (β[*]=[*]. 22, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), self-evaluative outcome expectations (β[*]=[*]. 21, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), descriptive norm (β[*]=[*]. 16, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), and experience (β[*]=[*]. 13, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions Our study is among the first to examine the determinants of systematic performance of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check, using an extended version of social cognitive theory to identify determinants. Based on the results, a number of practical recommendations can be made to promote the performance of <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> check...|$|R

30|$|The {{financial}} futures market in India is relatively new. The major advantage of derivatives as financial products {{is that their}} use minimizes {{the risks associated with}} securities. However, hedging effectiveness requires understanding key market signals such as trading margins, credit availability, and price discreteness. These signals have significant effects on limit orders and trading returns. Usually, the futures market maintains returns in relation to <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> value. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> value indicates <b>the</b> trading volume trend and thus <b>the</b> profit. <b>The</b> <b>tick</b> value is calculated by multiplying <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> size (<b>the</b> minimum price movement for a unit of a security) by the contract size, where the contract size is the multiplication of the Standard & Poor’s CNX Nifty Index Futures (hereafter “Nifty Futures” or “Nifty”) price and its market lots. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> size and contract size influence <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> value, considering <b>the</b> rate of submission of limit orders. Trading margins influence the submission of limit orders, and hence the sustainability of futures trading and liquidity. Therefore, <b>the</b> optimal <b>tick</b> value is a matter of concern in derivatives trading, because <b>the</b> <b>tick</b> size (and there by price discreteness) is one of the important factor that influences the price formation in the derivatives market.|$|R
