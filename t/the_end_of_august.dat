5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>August</b> the North Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness.

North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>August</b> the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative.
