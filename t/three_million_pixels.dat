5000|$|The more pixels used to {{represent}} an image, the closer the result can resemble the original. The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called the resolution, though resolution has a more specific definition. Pixel counts can be expressed as a single number, as in a [...] "three-megapixel" [...] digital camera, which has a nominal <b>three</b> <b>million</b> <b>pixels,</b> or {{as a pair of}} numbers, as in a [...] "640 by 480 display", which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom (as in a VGA display), and therefore has a total number of 640×480 = 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fast, robust, and {{completely}} automatic method for translational alignment of hand-held photographs. The technique employs percentile threshold bitmaps to accelerate image operations and avoid problems with the varying exposure levels used in high dynamic range (HDR) photography. An image pyramid is constructed from grayscale versions of each exposure, and these are converted to bitmaps which are then aligned horizontally and vertically using inexpensive shift and difference operations over each image. The cost of the algorithm is linear {{with respect to the}} number of pixels and effectively independent of the maximum translation. A <b>three</b> <b>million</b> <b>pixel</b> exposure can be aligned in {{a fraction of a second}} on a contemporary microprocessor using this technique...|$|R

Previous research is inconclusive about {{the circumstances under which}} LHRDs are beneficial and lacks behavioural data to explain inconsistencies in the findings. We conducted an experiment in which participants searched maps for densely or sparsely distributed targets, using 2 <b>million</b> <b>pixel</b> (0. 4 m × 0. 3 m), 12 <b>million</b> <b>pixel</b> (1. 3 m × 0. 7 m) and 54 <b>million</b> <b>pixel</b> displays (3. 0 m × 1. 3 m). Display resolution did not affect the speed at which dense targets were found, but participants found sparse targets in easily identifiable regions of interest 30 % faster with the 54 -million pixel display than with the other displays. This was because of the speed advantage conferred by physical navigation {{and the fact that the}} whole dataset fitted onto the 54 -million pixel display. Contrary to expectations, participants found targets at a similar speed and interacted in a similar manner (mostly short panning movements) with the 2 - and 12 -million pixel displays even though the latter provided more opportunity for physical navigation, though this may have been because panning used velocity-based control. We are applying these findings to the design of a virtual microscope for the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer...|$|R
