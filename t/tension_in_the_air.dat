40|$|Pneumocephalus {{is defined}} as <b>the</b> {{presence}} of <b>air</b> within <b>the</b> cranial vault; tension pneumocephalus occurs when <b>air</b> within <b>the</b> cranial vault becomes trapped and causes a mass effect or increased pressure, damaging the brain (Patel, Idicula, Carrau, 2 ̆ 6 Prevedello, 2013). Small amounts of <b>air</b> within <b>the</b> cranial vault can be reabsorbed or metabolized by the body over a few days without causing symptoms, however, <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> pneumocephalus <b>the</b> <b>air</b> cannot escape, causing extensive neurological symptoms (Webber-Jones, 2005). Thus, asymptomatic pneumocephalus can be a common finding following a cranial surgery, where as tension pneumocephalus is extremely rare (Webber-Jones, 2005). Markam (1967) noted that H. Chiari {{was the first to}} describe intracranial pneumocephalus in an autopsy he performed of a patient who died from ethmoiditis in 1884. W. H. Luckett was the first to use x-ray diagnostics to establish a diagnosis of pneumocephalus in 1913, and E. Wolff was the first to coin <b>the</b> term “pneumozephalus” <b>in</b> 1914 (Markham, 1967, p. 2). Of the 295 pneumocephalus cases reviewed, Markham (1967) reported that 218 were attributed to trauma, 38 to a neoplasm, 26 to infection, 11 were postoperative, and 2 were idiopathic (p. 13). Revealing even a small amount of intracranial air (0. 5 ml), a non-contrast CT scan is the diagnostic tool of choice for tension pneumocephalus, as it can also exclude other diagnoses (Simmons 2 ̆ 6 Luks, 2013). Mount Fuji sign is a CT scan finding in which a subdural air collection causes compression and separation to the frontal lobes giving a peaked appearance similar to the peaks of Mount Fuji (see Figures 1 2 ̆ 6 2) (Michel, 2004). The Mount Fuji sign is associated <b>in</b> patients with <b>tension</b> pneumocephalus (see Figure 1 2 ̆ 6 2) (Michel, 2004). Tension pneumocephalus is a surgical emergency requiring immediate attention (Patel et al., 2013). Without immediate and aggressive treatment, and in some cases even with treatment, neurological deterioration, cerebral cellular infarct and brain herniation can result, ultimately leading to death (Wohlgemuth, 1985). Thus, tension pneumocephalus has a high morbidity and mortality, if not recognized early with prompt intervention...|$|R

5000|$|Mühlhausen was a {{town with}} a {{population}} of 8500. During 1523 social tensions which had been brewing for several years came to a head, and the poorer inhabitants had managed to wrest some political concessions from the town-council; building on this success, the radical reform movement kept up the pressure, under the leadership of a lay-preacher named Heinrich Pfeiffer, who had been denouncing the practices of the old Church from the pulpit of St Nikolaus Church. Thus, before Müntzer arrived, there was already considerable <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He was not appointed to any pulpit, but this did not stop him from preaching, agitating and publishing pamphlets against Luther. His comrade-in-arms here was Pfeiffer; while the two men did not necessarily share the same beliefs (as in Zwickau with Storch) there was enough common-ground in their reformatory zeal and belief in the inspired spirit to allow them to work together closely. A minor civic coup took place in late September 1524, as a result of which, leading members of the town-council fled the town, taking with them the city insignia and the municipal horse. But the coup was short-lived - partly because of divisions within the reformers inside the town, and partly because the peasantry in the surrounding countryside took issue with the ‘unchristian behaviour’ of the urban radicals. After only seven weeks in the town, on 27 September, Müntzer was forced to abandon wife and child once more and escape with Pfeiffer to a safer haven. He travelled first to Nuremberg in the south, where he arranged for the publication of his anti-Lutheran pamphlet A Highly Provoked Vindication and Refutation of the unspiritual soft-living flesh in Wittenberg, [...] as well as one entitled A Manifest Exposé of False Faith - both of which were confiscated by the city authorities, the former before any copies could be distributed. Müntzer kept a low profile in Nuremberg, clearly considering that his best strategy would be to spread his teaching in print, rather than end up behind bars. He remained here until November and then left for the south-west of Germany and Switzerland, where peasants and plebeians were beginning to organise themselves for the great peasant uprising of 1525 in defiance of their feudal overlords. There is no direct evidence of what Müntzer did {{in this part of the}} world, but almost certainly he would have come in contact with leading members of the various rebel conspiracies; it is proposed that he met the later Anabaptist leader, Balthasar Hubmaier in Waldshut, and it is known that he was in Basel in December, where he met the Zwinglian reformer Oecolampadius, and may also have met the Swiss Anabaptist Conrad Grebel there. He spent several weeks in the Klettgau area, and there is some evidence to suggest that he helped the peasants to formulate their grievances. While the famous ‘Twelve Articles’ of the Swabian peasants were certainly not composed by Müntzer, at least one important supporting document, the Constitutional Draft, may well have originated with him.|$|E

All of Gotham City has been trapped within a dome {{for the better part of}} a year. Barry feels trapped in more ways than just that, robbed of his super-speed by the dome.He had come back to Gotham from his home in the 31st Century to appear at a {{paralympics}} event, and the dome appeared in the hour that he was there. He has been trying to find a way out every day, but with every metahuman's abilities gone, it seems impossible. It puzzles Barry a little how well the people of Gotham have adapted to their new state of affairs. He still runs, as ever, hoping that one day he'll run fast enough and hard enough to access the Speed Force. No such luck. A beeping of his pager prompts him to stop running and call in from a payphone. Some lab results are back at Gotham Central, and he has to be at work.He managed to get a job with his credentials from the Central City Police Department's crime lab, and he's been paired with Josie Leighton as his chief lab assistant for the last six months. Barry is fond of her - maybe too fond of her. She's fond of him, and he knows it, but Iris is never far from his mind. In another life, maybe he would take her up on her offers to go out for coffee together. Still, he can't help but worry that this is another life, and he might as well start living it. Barry joins Bruce Wayne for coffee in her place, expressing his worries about just how doomed their efforts to escape the dome are. Bruce suggests that he think on this challenge less as a sprint, and more like a marathon.As Barry cabs back to work, he and his driver sense a <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that is unexpected and unusual. Receiving another page, he exits the cab to make a call back to Josie, who warns of an urgent crime scene investigation he's needed at. Seeing traffic piling up, he just pays off the driver and decides to walk the eight blocks to the scene. However, he is surprised when he looks up and sees that the dome has disappeared, and a voice rings out warning that with the dome gone, champions must rise up from all of the cities on the planet Telos's surface, and fight for the survival of their homes. Seeing his chance, Barry runs to find Bruce and tell him what he heard - but as he runs, he feels himself getting faster and faster. His connection with Speed Force is back. Gleefully, he opens his ring, and dons his uniform as The Flash.Climbing to a high vantage point on the edge of Gotham, Barry realizes with horror that this isn't Earth at all - and there are other cities out there. Worriedly, he calls out to the voice he heard earlier, begging to know who it was - and what he meant. Knowing that he is to be one of the champions, he calls out that he's ready. A challenger from another city answers him, admitting that while he is not eager to fight, they are supposed to. He too has only just got his powers back. Though he hasn't been sure for some time, Barry's prospective opponent believes that he is Superman.|$|E
