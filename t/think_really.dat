Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, [...] "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I <b>think</b> <b>really</b> we should say 'Produced by yumi amasaki'." [...] Until her single [...] "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, [...] "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." [...] However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for [...] "M" [...] that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbows fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved {{in the composition of}} subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.|$|E
2500|$|Kindred {{reveals the}} {{repressed}} trauma slavery caused in America’s collective memory of history. In {{an interview on}} 1985, Butler suggested that this trauma partly comes from attempts to forget America's dark past: [...] "I think most people don’t know or don’t realize that at least 10 million blacks were killed just {{on the way to}} this country, just during the middle passage....They don’t really want to hear it partly because it makes whites feel guilty." [...] In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist’s left arm: [...] "I couldn’t really let [...] come all the way back. I couldn’t let her return to what she was, I couldn’t let her come back whole and , I <b>think,</b> <b>really</b> symbolizes her not coming back whole. Antebellum slavery didn’t leave people quite whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luke Goss as Prince Nuada Silverlance: King Balor's {{son and a}} {{martial arts}} expert of {{extraordinary}} proficiency. Goss was previously cast as mutant vampire Jared Nomak in del Toro's 2002 film Blade II, and the director approached the actor to be cast in Hellboy II. The only other actor considered for the part was Charlie Hunnam. Goss trained with action director and former Jackie Chan Stunt Team member, Brad Allan, learning sword and spear skills for six to seven months for his role. He and Anna Walton also learned ancient Gaelic from a dialog coach for their lines. Goss did not perceive Nuada as evil, explaining, [...] "It's issues, his people, he's {{part of what he}} truly believes. I don't <b>think,</b> <b>really,</b> he's so deluded... is driven by an ethic that was instilled by the person he has problems [...] his father, and inevitably, that leads into the conflict with him and Hellboy." [...] Goss also noted that his character admired and revered his twin sister, portrayed by Anna Walton. He said of the prince and the princess, [...] "There is an incestuous relationship that's not maybe overly obvious to everybody, but some people hopefully will pick up on the fact, certainly from my direction towards her." ...|$|E

He felt the Pirelli tyres would change the event's aspect drastically but aimed to win the race: [...] "The competition in Macau is always super strong, and this year will be no exception. I <b>think</b> <b>really</b> the only one missing is [...] Lance Stroll, but other than that it's as competitive as it could get." [...] Félix da Costa stated he was returning to Macau because of its iconic status and still had knowledge of the track despite having not driven on the circuit in the last four years. When asked if he felt he could achieve the victory, he replied [...] "yes and no" [...] because of not having had experience in Formula Three cars for the previous three years, but said he would give it an attempt and would be pleased to secure a top-five finishing position. The track's fastest lap record holder Sérgio Sette Câmara said it was [...] "amazing" [...] to compete in the event, revealing that he would carry the experience he had from the previous year and was confident in his car's set-up.|$|E
