5|$|On average, cadmium {{concentrations}} {{in the blood of}} smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking.|$|E

5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be no documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding {{in the trunk of}} Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the Norman Conquest, Somerset {{came under the}} control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> to have been some Danish {{settlement}} at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Theridiidae weave irregular, tangled, {{three-dimensional}} webs, popularly known as cobwebs. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> to be an evolutionary trend towards {{a reduction in the}} amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be some}} consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after {{the reign of the}} emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E

5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there {{does not seem to have}} been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> to only be one known {{example of}} extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of Eöl and Aredhel, {{in which the}} latter {{actually}} left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her (albeit he was actually trying to kill their son Maeglin). However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> {{to prevail}} the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E

5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E
5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, {{who was also a}} royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were {{brought to the attention of}} King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

60|$|Everything {{seemed so}} different, so unreal. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> {{no reason why}} people should go along the street, and houses pile up in the daylight. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> no reason why these things should occupy the space, instead of leaving it empty. His friends talked to him: he heard the sounds, and he answered. But why there should be the noise of speech he could not understand.|$|R

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, but <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be a certain}} growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to {{have been}} some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were {{the key to the}} security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|The line {{of route}} runs {{parallel}} to the West Somerset Railway from Watchet to Washford where it forms a foot and cycle path. Washford station has been demolished and a bungalow is on the site. The line then curves south west, partly {{in the form of}} a road, past Cleeve Abbey and Roadwater, where the station buildings survive with an extension to form a bungalow. The line continues to Comberow. The siding group that was at the foot of the incline is clearly identifiable at Comberow, to the west of the bridge that carried the incline, as is the station master's house and traces of the platform. Part of the line northwards from <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> to be a footpath.|$|E
