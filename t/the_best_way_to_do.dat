5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E
5|$|Pick became traffic {{development}} officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E

25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this is to slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, François Gouin went to Hamburg {{to learn}} German. Based on his {{experience}} as a Latin teacher, he thought <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, {{when he went to the}} academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.|$|E

500|$|During the Vichy French counterattack, Berryman {{was given}} {{command of the}} Australian forces in {{the centre of the}} {{position}} around Merdjayoun. This scratch force became known as [...] "Berryforce". His mission was to check the enemy advance in the Merdjayoun area. Berryman decided that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this would be to recapture Merdjayoun. This presented considerable difficulty, for although his force contained two infantry battalions, the 2/25th and 2/33rd, and a pioneer battalion, the 2/2nd, his headquarters was not equipped to control a battle in the manner of an infantry brigade, as it lacked appropriate staff and communications. Moreover, while he was supported by [...] mechanised cavalry and 22 artillery pieces, [...] the opposing French forces had tanks.|$|E

Wedel knew he must bring the Russians to battle before they could move on Frankfurt or risk his reputation with the King. On 23 July, Wedel ordered another reconnaissance of Saltykov's troops at Langen Meil, a small settlement outside Key, and found them in motion; assuming they meant to move on Frankfurt, he subsequently ordered an advance on the Russian right flank. Wedel's best opportunity seemed to be securing the Paltzig heights before the Russians could do so, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that would be through Kay.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Steven Moffat {{announced in}} 2011 {{that he intended}} to give a [...] "rest" [...] to the Daleks. The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the [...] "most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become [...] "cuddly" [...] over the years and their true menace forgotten; with [...] "Asylum" [...] he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Gillan admitted that she had not been scared of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he [...] "couldn't resist" [...] the opportunity.|$|E

500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, or [...] in Japan, {{was released}} worldwide for the PSP between 2005 and 2008. With {{the launch of}} the PSP, Keiji Inafune and his team debated on whether or not to create a Mega Man X9. [...] "So, we decided that instead of going the X9 route, let's go back to the series' roots and rediscover what makes the X series so classic," [...] Inafune concluded. [...] "We felt that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that would be to make an X remake." [...] Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, Maverick Hunter X features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes. According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of Mega Man X8.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it was go in the studio and work up a remix".|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he can get away with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to take it home. [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E
500|$|... "Leonard Betts" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. Scripts written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a [...] "John Gillnitz"—a portmanteau of the three writers' names. According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] {{was supposed to come}} before the episode. Vince Gilligan explained, [...] " [...] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before , and we knew <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that would be with a really creepy stand-alone monster story." [...] Thus, the air date of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was flipped with [...] "Never Again" [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the former episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently in [...] "Never Again"—which featured Scully acting notably out of character—had she been aware that Scully would get cancer at the time, as Scully only discovers this at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E
