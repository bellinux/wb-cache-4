5|$|A limited 3-track EP {{was issued}} to U.S. Target stores. <b>The</b> <b>disc</b> was {{released}} on 10 February 2004 and was received free with the purchase of Body Language.|$|E
5|$|House was {{released}} by the Masters of Cinema label in the United Kingdom on DVD. Bonus features on <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> included interviews with {{the cast and crew}} and the theatrical trailer. House {{was released}} by the Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray on October 26, 2010. Bonus features on <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> include a making-of featurette that features interviews with the crew; director Obayashi's short film Emotion, which was first released in 1966; an appreciation video featuring American filmmaker Ti West; and a promotional trailer for House.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> galactic <b>disc</b> {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of gas, dust and stars. The {{gas and dust}} component of <b>the</b> galactic <b>disc</b> is called <b>the</b> gaseous <b>disc.</b> <b>The</b> star component of <b>the</b> galactic <b>disc</b> is called <b>the</b> stellar <b>disc.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>discs</b> on <b>the</b> left appear {{dark and}} {{the ones on the}} right appear light, this is because of the two displays. In the display on the left, the dark area on the left {{seemingly}} belongs to <b>the</b> <b>discs,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> are obscured by the light mist. On the right side, the same dark areas are interpreted as belonging to the dark mist. In the meanwhile, the white parts are seen as the color of <b>the</b> <b>discs.</b> Therefore, our perception of the lightness of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> is significantly influenced by the display, which is the mist in this case (Anderson & Winawer, 2005).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>discs</b> are {{designed}} to hold 300 gigabytes of data in their first release, then a second version of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> will hold up to 500 gigabytes, and eventually a third version of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> {{will be able to}} store up to one terabyte of data, based on the roadmap plans of both companies.|$|R
5|$|Scully leaves The Smoking Man {{and gives}} <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> to The Lone Gunmen to analyze, {{but it turns}} out that The Smoking Man swapped <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> for a blank one. She goes back to his office but it has been emptied. Mulder informs her that this was a con and she was used to {{retrieve}} this information, but he does not understand why The Smoking Man left Scully alive. The final scene shows The Smoking Man throwing the real disc into a lake.|$|E
5|$|While in the {{car with}} Mace, Lenny plays <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an {{attacker}} at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E
5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses a spindle that allows the user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{object is}} horizontal stirred mill, and I have studied six different Stirrer <b>disc</b> (including <b>the</b> trapezoidal tooth <b>disc,</b> <b>the</b> serrated toothed <b>disc,</b> <b>the</b> common <b>disc,</b> decagonal <b>disc,</b> <b>the</b> octagonal <b>disc</b> and <b>the</b> hexagonal <b>disc)</b> structure on <b>the</b> horizontal stirred mill grinding efficiency. The paper applied EDEM for six {{different forms of}} Stirrer <b>disc</b> simulation, analyzing <b>the</b> simulation results, it is concluded that: when <b>the</b> Stirrer <b>disc</b> structure is <b>the</b> trapezoidal tooth <b>disc,</b> <b>the</b> comprehensive performance of horizontal stirred grinding machine is best, with high grinding efficiency, low power consumption, provide a reference {{for the design of}} the Horizontal stirred mill...|$|R

50|$|Notebook {{sheets are}} removed by peeling the {{perforations}} away from <b>the</b> binding <b>discs.</b> Sheets are added by affixing the perforations to <b>the</b> <b>discs.</b> Sheets {{can be transferred}} between disc-bound notebooks of different functions and sizes, provided <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> have <b>the</b> same profile and spacing. In addition to using paper specifically manufactured for a particular disc-binding system, ordinary paper can be inserted by using a specially designed hole punch to perforate the pages to conform to <b>the</b> <b>discs.</b>|$|R
5|$|A fan disc {{entitled}} Ef: First Fan Disc {{was initially}} released during Comiket 72 between August 11 and August 13, 2007; <b>the</b> <b>disc,</b> playable on a PC was later sold in retail stores starting on August 25, 2007. <b>The</b> <b>disc,</b> unlike the normal visual novels in the series, {{did not contain}} adult content, and offered {{a glimpse into the}} world of Ef, though only touched on points from Ef: The First Tale, the first game in the series. Ef: The First Tale was released as an adult game for the PC on December 22, 2006. The second game in the series, Ef: The Latter Tale was released on May 30, 2008. MangaGamer released both games in English: Ef: The First Tale was released on July 27, 2012 and Ef: The Latter Tale was released on December 20, 2013.|$|E
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> to be read.|$|E
50|$|The Columbia Years 1955-1985 is a 4 CD Miles Davis compilation. The box set is {{furthermore}} {{split up}} into the sections of blues, standards, originals, moods and electric. These cover tracks 1-8 of <b>the</b> first <b>disc,</b> tracks 9-10 and tracks 1-3 from <b>the</b> second <b>disc,</b> tracks 4-7 on <b>the</b> second <b>disc</b> and tracks 1-2 on <b>the</b> third <b>disc,</b> tracks 3-9 on <b>the</b> third <b>disc</b> and <b>the</b> final <b>disc</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|Towards Irwin’s {{last years}} of working with <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> he reintroduced <b>the</b> line into his work. He sliced a thin three-inch wide line {{through the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> to add a pop of color (the gray wall) and disrupt the minimalism.|$|R

5|$|Around <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, {{which in}} Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Remedy and Xbox {{released}} a special collector's {{edition of the}} hit horror game, loaded with new content on <b>the</b> <b>disc,</b> including a 44-page digital comic book with art by Gerry Kissell and Amin Amat, and written by Remedy Entertainment's Mikko Rautalahti, who also wrote the script for the video game.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jasjit enters De Silva's {{apartment}} {{to wait for}} him and finds <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> He receives a phone call saying that if he wants to see his son again, he will have to bring <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> to the men who are holding Deepu hostage. When he meets them, he learns that DeSilva has been alive all along and is actually Vardhan, who was using Vijay to get close to his competitor. Later, Jasjit engage in a combat with Vijay but Deepu interrupts him, telling him about Vijay, who has been his guardian in Jasjit's absence. Jasjit teams up with Vijay and Roma and shares information about Vardhan's real identity. They come up with a plan. Jasjit arranges a meeting with Vardhan, but the trio have informed the Interpol.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>discs</b> {{featured}} such h.m.p. superstars as Risa Coda and Hikaru Koto and {{in addition}} to two hours of video, many contained adult minigames playable on the PSP. The last of <b>the</b> <b>discs,</b> labeled with ID codes HOUM-00001 to HOUM-00013, was released April 21, 2006.|$|R
40|$|A {{cryogenic}} gyroscope housing having gas spin-up means {{provided in}} annular discs inserted between housing shells is described. A circumferential recess {{in the inner}} edges of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> at their juncture serves as the gas spin-up channel, and recesses in <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> at their junctures with the shells form suction channels. <b>The</b> <b>discs</b> also have inlet and outlet ports communicating with the spin-up channel and exhaust slots communicating with the suction channels. Mating surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> and housing shells are held in position by optical contact at the equational plane of the housing. Suspension electrodes and thin-film readout loops are disposed in shells. A centering band and clamp rings provide for proper alinement and placement of parts in formation of optical contact joints...|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} of circular discs {{in a dry}} two-dimensional, monodisperse foam is studied. This, {{a variation}} of the classical Stokes experiment, provides a prototype experiment to study a foam?s response. The interaction between two circular particles of equal size and weight is investigated as they fall through the foam under their own weight. Their positions are tracked and the lift and drag force measured in numerical calculations using the Surface Evolver. The initial placements of <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> are varied in each of two different initial configurations, one in which <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> are side by side and the second in which <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> are one above the other. It is shown that discs that are initially side by side rotate as a system during the descent in the foam. In the second scenario, <b>the</b> upper <b>disc</b> falls into <b>the</b> wake of the lower, after which <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> sediment as one with a constant non-zero separation. We present evidence that the foam screens this interaction for specific initial separations between <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> in both configurations. The force between a channel wall and a nearby sedimenting disc is also investigated. Financial support is gratefully acknowledged from EPSRC (EP/D 071127 / 1) ...|$|R

5|$|Most {{species in}} this order lack pedicellariae and {{all have a}} {{delicate}} skeletal arrangement with small or no marginal plates on <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> and arms. They have numerous groups of short spines on the aboral surface. This group includes the red starfish Echinaster sepositus.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside <b>the</b> <b>disc.</b> The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
50|$|A hydroviscous drive {{consists}} {{of one or}} more <b>discs</b> connected to <b>the</b> input shaft pressed against a similar disc or <b>discs</b> connected to <b>the</b> output shaft. Torque is transmitted from the input shaft to the output shaft through an oil film between <b>the</b> <b>discs.</b> <b>The</b> transmitted torque is proportional to the pressure exerted by a hydraulic cylinder that presses <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> together.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compilation}} set {{is split}} {{up in two}} <b>discs.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>disc</b> (on <b>the</b> packaging referred to as [...] "The Black Disc") contains tracks from their studio releases, while <b>the</b> second <b>disc</b> ("The Silver Disc") lists unreleased and more obscure releases from the group.

5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> is encrypted using these keys. The title keys are stored on <b>the</b> <b>disc</b> and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E

5000|$|The Standard Talking Machine Company was an American {{record label}} {{that was created}} in October 1901 and {{operated}} until March 1918. The Chicago, Illinois based company produced several models of phonographs from Columbia Records parts and issued single-sided and double-sided disc records from Columbia Records masters. Despite the label name, <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> were not quite [...] "Standard"; the spindle hole {{at the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> was 9/16 inch, larger than the industry standard.

40|$|A novel {{electrochemical}} Parallel Disc Device (PDD) {{has been}} designed and built at the Process Engineering and Light Metals (PELM) Centre of Central Queensland University. This device, built primarily to study aspects of flow accelerated corrosion, consists of two discs separated by a precision controlled gap. <b>The</b> bottom <b>disc</b> (which accommodates <b>the</b> working electrode) is immobile while <b>the</b> top <b>disc</b> rotates and enables a flow of liquid between <b>the</b> <b>discs.</b> <b>The</b> gap between <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> can be set within the range 0. 050 to 5. 000 mm with a precision of 0. 005 mm. The PDD is capable of generating very high wall shear rates and the shear of liquid at the working electrode is purely tangential as long as flow between <b>the</b> <b>discs</b> remains laminar. This paper presents results of preliminary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) characterisations of the fluid flow in the gap between <b>the</b> parallel <b>discs.</b> In addition we present some results for the electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen at a copper PDD electrode...|$|R
