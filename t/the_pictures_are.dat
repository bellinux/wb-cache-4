5|$|Along {{the central}} {{section of the}} ceiling, Michelangelo {{depicted}} nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> organized into three groups of three alternating large and small panels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> not in {{strictly}} chronological order. If {{they are}} perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> drawn as Schlegel diagram {{perspective}} projections, {{centered on}} the cell at pos. 3, with a consistent orientation, and the 16 cells at position 0 are shown solid, alternately colored.|$|E

25|$|For four of {{the trips}} a {{photography}} book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of images includes many photographs and diagrams both {{in black and}} white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the Solar System and its planets, DNA, and human anatomy and reproduction. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict {{a broad range of}} cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of chemical composition. All measures used on <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle was}} fitted with 7mm armour, was {{powered by a}} 20hp {{gasoline}} internal combustion engine, {{and was able to}} move both forward and backward, with two driver positions, one at the front and the other at the back. It was to be equipped with machine guns on raised platforms attached to the compactor chassis: one in front, one in the rear, and two projecting from the sides for 360 degrees coverage. This armament was never actually fitted: the gun shields in <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> the result of retouching. The retouched photographs seem to indicate two cannon and six machine guns. Total length was 7 metres, width 2 metres, height 2.3 metres. It weighed a little under 10 tons. It would have been manned by a crew of nine: one commander, two mechanics and six gunners. Speed varied between 3 and 5km/h.|$|E

25|$|To {{left and}} right of the central door are two {{permanently}} installed fields consisting of upright flat marble slabs inlaid with an unusual Intarsia technique, with geometric and floral motifs cut into the marble in relief. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> from the Arab tradition and are supplemented by small birds, swastikas, flowers, palmettes and leaves. The wells of the reliefs were originally filled with a red, now darkened mass of wax and mastic. In the same technique, marble inlays are also mounted on the pillar trim, connecting panels and the door lintels. Two icons are also embedded above the lintels. On {{the left side of}} the door, the Panagia is depicted with the Child Jesus. To the right of the central door is the Christ Pantocrator with the right hand in a sign of blessing and the left holding a closed Evangelion. These two icons are modern creations which took the place of 17th century icons which were stolen in 1982.|$|E

To beat them, Jimmy works to gain the trust of the Nerds and their leader, student president Earnest Jones (Jesse Tendler). After beating Earnest, Jimmy befriends him and enlists his help in ruining the Jocks' reputation. The Nerds get Jimmy to take inappropriate pictures of the school's head cheerleader, Mandy Wiles (Elena Franklin), <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> spread around town, embarrassing Mandy. Jimmy decides to cover the pictures around town. This event is followed by the jocks attacking the nerds, which Jimmy fights off. After the drama dies down, the Nerds reveal a plan to sabotage the Jocks' big home game and Jimmy does all of the hard work, embarrassing not just the Jocks, but also the cheerleaders and the school mascot. Humiliated, the Jocks and their leader, Ted Thompson (Alex Cendese), challenge Jimmy to a fight in the school's football field, which they subsequently lose.|$|E

[...] The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|E
50|$|One way a zograscope enhances depth {{perception}} is by minimizing other depth cues that specify the flatness and pictorial nature of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>The</b> image <b>is</b> magnified, perhaps {{giving it a}} visual angle similar to the real scene <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> depicting. <b>The</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>are</b> blocked by <b>the</b> frame of the lens. The light coming from the lens to the eye is collimated, preventing accommodation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> {{painted in}} tempera on an oak panel covered with {{stretched}} canvas.

2500|$|... so the DOF {{ratio is}} in direct {{proportion}} to the format size, due to the smaller format size having a smaller circle of confusion when the final image size is the same.

2500|$|Tottywatch is an {{irregular}} feature that comprises pictures of attendees at political events. Although <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> {{of both men}} and women, the majority are of attractive young women. The comments section invariably discusses their merits in the crudest terms. In response, Fawkes began producing occasional [...] "Tottywatch" [...] pieces often using pictures taken with a phone camera.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have also}} been studies {{as to whether or}} not the images on the dotaku have {{significant}} meanings. According to a researcher named Oba, each picture contains a hidden pictograph that can be deciphered through a phonetic reading. For example, a picture of a man shooting a deer can be read as [...] "iru ka" [...] (to shoot a deer), but when combined to form [...] "Iruka" [...] , the pictures refer to Soga no Iruka, which is a reference to the Soga Dynasty. Through several more readings, Oba discovered that the drawings [...] "contain references to precise persons, places, and events in Japanese prehistory" [...] as well as provided [...] "info of shapes of buildings, hunting customs, and other aspects of daily life", possibly left for future generations. However, due to a lack of concrete evidence, other researchers have deemed it improbable that <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> actually hidden pictographs; it is possible that <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> just pictures. Despite the lack of evidence, researchers do believe that the pictures aren’t just casual pictures drawn for the sake of art, that there is some other meaning behind them.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> {{painted in}} oil on canvas. It was {{inspired}} by the round shapes that marked the return of the artist to orphism and study of harmony in painting.

2500|$|He {{began to}} paint {{panoramic}} views of Madrid about 1960. His work {{from this period}} attracted recognition, first within Spain—in 1961 he had his first solo show in [...] Madrid—and later, in 1965 and 1968, at [...] the Staempfli Gallery in New York. [...] López García faithfully adhered to familiar subjects: images of women, anonymous and humble objects of domestic surroundings, desolate spaces, images of his garden and landscape. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> sometimes worked {{on for more than}} twenty years, some of them remaining unfinished.|$|E
2500|$|The inner {{room of the}} Panagia Episkopi was {{decorated}} with frescoes during its construction. They were covered with plaster during the Ottoman period. Over {{the course of the}} centuries, most of them were destroyed by moisture. [...] Some of the frescoes were successfully freed from the plaster and restored, however. The figures in <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> reminiscent of Cappadocian murals, which led the Greek construction researcher and Byzantinologist Anastasios Orlandos to conclude that the artist was of eastern origin. He dated the frescoes to 1100. The frescoes show various Hierarchs, Christian martyrs and scenes from the life of Christ as well as other biblical scenes.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, {{as social}} media become major {{platforms}} on which people receive news and share events, iPhone photography is gaining popularity {{as the primary}} tool for online visual communication. An iPhone is easy to carry and always accessible in a pocket, and the immediacy in taking pictures can reduce {{the intervention of the}} scene and subjects to a minimum. [...] With the assistance of abundant applications, photographers can achieve a highly aesthetic way of conveying messages. [...] Once <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> uploaded onto social media, photographers can immediately expose their work {{to a wide range of}} audiences and receive real-time feedback from them. [...] With a large number of active participants online, the pictures could also be spread out in a short period of time, thus evoking profound influence on society.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have shown that a task-irrelevant emotionally arousing {{stimulus}} can interfere with the processing of a shortly following target, it remains unclear whether an emotional stimulus can also retro-actively interrupt the ongoing processing of an earlier target. In two experiments, we examined whether the presentation of a negative emotionally arousing picture can disrupt working memory consolidation of a preceding visual target. In both experiments, the effects of negative emotional <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> compared with <b>the</b> effects of neutral pictures. In Experiment 1, <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> entirely task-irrelevant whereas in Experiment 2 <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -alternative forced choice task that required participants to respond to the color of a frame surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> did not interfere with target consolidation when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> task-irrelevant, whereas such interference <b>was</b> observed when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -AFC task. Most importantly, however, the results showed no effects of whether <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> had neutral or emotional content. Implications for further research are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners." ...|$|E
2500|$|The entire work {{contains}} about 5,000 illustrations. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> arranged in two parallel columns on each page, each column having four medallions with pictures. Parallel to {{the pictures and}} alternating with them are two other narrower columns, with four legends each, one legend to each picture; the legends consisting alternatively of Biblical texts and moral or allegorical applications; whilst the pictures represent the subjects of the Biblical texts or of the applications of them. [...] The illustrations are executed with the greatest skill. The painting {{is said to be}} one of the best specimens of thirteenth-century work and the MS. was in all probability prepared for someone in the highest rank of life. A specimen of the second edition of the [...] "Bible Moralisée" [...] is to be found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (MS. Français No. 167). Whilst it is identical with the copy which has just been examined in the selection and order of the Biblical passages, it differs from it in the greater simplicity and brevity of the moral and allegorical teaching based on them. Another important Bible, intended to instruct by means of pictures, was that which has been called the [...] "Bible Historiée toute figurée". It was a work of the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. In general outline and plan it resembles the class of Bible which has gone before, but it differs from it in the selection of Bible passages and in the allegorical explanations derived from them. Coming to the life of Christ, the author of the [...] "Bible Historiée toute figurée" [...] dispensed with a written text altogether, and contented himself with writing over the pictures depicting scenes of Christ's life, a brief explanatory legend.|$|E
