5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnam War had a {{profound}} effect on Powell's views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proper <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography My American Journey. The Powell Doctrine, as the views became known, was a central component of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf War (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and U.S. invasion of Afghanistan (the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> overwhelming <b>military</b> force.|$|R
40|$|Throughout American history, policymakers have {{struggled}} with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> American <b>military</b> power. <b>The</b> Limited War argument holds that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> force needs to remain {{an option to}} support American diplomacy. The Never Again argument, meanwhile, holds that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> American <b>military</b> power should be undertaken only {{in the face of}} threats against vital national interests. The most influential Never Again argument has been the 1984 Weinberger Doctrine, later expanded to the Weinberger-Powell Doctrine, which sought to limit <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> American <b>military</b> power. After the Vietnam War and the 1983 Marine barracks bombing, the Weinberger-Powell Doctrine was ascendant over Limited War arguments like Secretary of State George Schultz's case in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limited <b>use</b> <b>of</b> American <b>military</b> force against targets of less than vital interest. Between the 1991 Gulf War and the 2002 Invasion of Iraq, however, the Weinberger-Powell Doctrine lost much of its influence with American policymakers. This thesis will establish a link between the loss of influence by the Weinberger-Powell Doctrine and the rise in the utility of force based on improvements in military technology and doctrines, leading to a broadening of policy objectives {{that would not have been}} possible during the Cold War.

5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> force and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to codify, {{preserve}} and pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts {{form the basis of}} our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E

40|$|The American {{military}} and Executive Branch have transitioned {{the way that}} the US engages in war strategy to rely more and more on private military contractors. This paper sought to examine the consequences that this dependence will cause.

First their <b>use</b> lessons <b>the</b> political accountability that is necessary in preventing or ending war through the reduction of audience costs. Second the indiscriminate brutality that private security contractors are infamous for leads to the radicalization of the population and the potential for violent mobilization against the offender.
