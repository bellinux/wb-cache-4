2500|$|The typical {{tools of}} a {{reinforcing}} bar ironworker are pliers, tie wire reel, rod buster bag, and a rebar hook. [...] The ironworker’s work pliers {{is the main}} tool of a reinforcing bar ironworker. [...] The pliers cuts soft annealed rebar tie wire and twists the wire into place. [...] The pliers have a hook bend handle, and a spring in between the handles for self-opening of the pliers. [...] The pliers cut ACSR, screws, nails and most hardened wire. [...] Also, the pliers is finished with a black oxide paint to resist rust on the tool. [...] A tie wire reel is a lightweight aluminum alloy mechanism used for dispensing tie wire efficiently. [...] A rod buster bag, a pouch, is a split-leather double bottom bag used for holding tools while {{they are not in}} use.

A voltage portal is used to assist workers in creating an electrically safe work condition {{as part of a}} lockout-tagout procedure before beginning work on electrical or mechanical equipment.|$|R
50|$|On June 17, 1958, as a crane {{stretched}} {{from the north}} side of the new bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several spans collapsed. Seventy-nine workers plunged 30 metres (100 ft) into the water. Eighteen were killed either instantly or shortly thereafter, possibly drowned by their heavy <b>tool</b> <b>belts.</b> A diver searching for bodies drowned later, bringing the total fatalities for the collapse to 19. In a subsequent Royal Commission inquiry, the bridge collapse was attributed to miscalculation by bridge engineers. A temporary arm, holding the fifth anchor span, was deemed too light to bear the weight.|$|R

5000|$|Chicago trained {{herself in}} [...] "macho arts," [...] taking classes in auto body work, boat building, and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned spray {{painting}} techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to {{any type of}} media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics {{would be used to}} create fireworks for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring fiberglass and metal into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under Mim Silinsky to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in The Dinner Party. Chicago also added the skill of stained glass to her artistic <b>tool</b> <b>belt,</b> which she used for The Holocaust Project. Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed. [...] Since 2003, Chicago has been working with glass.|$|E

Lower classes wore them almost as <b>tool</b> <b>belts</b> with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|R

Construction of production line was projected in order to its operation can be secured by one production workman, which controls and chooses operation of CNC programme, takes separate roll bended rotor and stator plates of inductive position sensor from bending rolls and according to required technological procedure he composes them to rotor and stator complexes. Construction of production line was projected {{so that it is}} possible to move it by crane without necessity to dismantle and subsequently to put together and adjust the line. ...|$|R

50|$|Later that night, Terry finds a human tooth {{under her}} bed, and later awakes {{to hear a}} man {{breathing}} heavily upstairs, as though he's masturbating. The next morning, Terry and Nancy take a shower, while someone watches through a peep hole in the wall. That morning, Nancy sets off through the woods to reach town. When she arrives at a rural country road, she is attacked by figure with a long scythe, who slashes her to death. That evening at dinner, Mrs. Penrose's divulgers her views on men and her daughter, while Terry worries about Nancy's absence. That night, Terry once again hears the breathing, and goes to see who it is, finding an abandoned room with black and white pictures of two children, and an old <b>tool</b> <b>belt</b> with a dusty gun and machete. She goes back downstairs, and sees the man staring in at her through window, and runs screaming through the house. Marion calms her down and tells her that the man is Carl, her brother who has {{the mind of a}} five-year-old, and whom their mother abandoned.

50|$|Shortly afterwards, David steals {{money from}} the Windass family, who refuse {{to pay for a}} kitchen Joe fitted. In revenge, Gary Windass (Mikey North) and his uncle Len (Conor Ryan) steal Joe's tools so Tina, David and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) rip out the Windasses' kitchen and set it on fire but their plan backfires as Gary and Len tear out Gail's kitchen. Joe goes to great expense to build her a new one, despite being in a lot of debt from the failure of his business. His plan for a perfect Christmas is ruined when Gail invites the Windasses over for Christmas Day. They give him a <b>tool</b> <b>belt</b> as a Christmas present, which reminds Joe of the tools that have been stolen from him. When Gary {{repeatedly}} makes moves on Tina and Gary and David get into a brawl, Joe has enough. He begins screaming at the Windasses, telling them they are pathetic, and throws food at them. They leave the house humiliated. Joe then walks out. The next day, Gail and Joe make up, but Gail is shaken, as he has reminded her of some of the men from her past.|$|E
40|$|Figure 1. BodyLenses are body-controlled magic lenses {{that support}} {{parallel}} work in multi-user scenarios through territoriality (a), {{can be of}} various shapes, e. g. body-centric shapes being modified by arm gestures (b), and provide personal tools and clipboards for local interaction on the display (c). Magic lenses are popular tools to provide locally altered views of visual data. In this paper, we introduce the concept of BodyLenses, special kinds of magic lenses for wall dis-plays that are mainly controlled by body interactions. After motivating the rationale for body-centric lenses, we present a comprehensive design space of BodyLenses, where we ana-lyse fundamental aspects such as appearance, function, in-teraction and use in multi-user contexts. Within that space, we investigated and implemented a number of design alter-natives and propose solutions for lens positioning, dynamic shape modification, distance-based parameter mappings {{and the use of}} BodyLenses as portable <b>tool</b> <b>belts.</b> We demonstrate the practicality of our novel concepts with four realised ap-plication scenarios. With this work, we hope to lay the foun-dation for future research and systems based on body-driven lenses. ACM Classification Keyword...|$|R
