The field tests conducted for Phonevision lasted for 90 days and were tested in Chicago, Illinois.

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced {{the prospect of having}} <b>to</b> purchase <b>descrambling</b> equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|R
50|$|Typical modern cable boxes {{include some}} form of {{descrambling}} ability. Such a cable box must also be addressable (see below) {{in order to be}} told <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the signal for a given channel. Early electronic cable boxes, for example, could descramble channels that used inversion as a scrambling method.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{television}} receivers {{greatly reduced}} {{the need for}} external set-top boxes, although cable converter boxes continue to be used <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> premium cable channels according to carrier-controlled access restrictions, and to receive digital cable channels, along with using interactive services like video on demand, pay per view, and home shopping through television.|$|E
50|$|With {{pay-per-view}} services, selected channels offer {{movies and}} special {{events such as}} sports or adult entertainment, for an additional fee, on a per-movie or per-program basis. A special addressable converter is furnished by the cable company to subscribers of this service. Through the use of special equipment, the cable company can direct the customer's cable box <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the program for which the fee was paid.|$|E
5000|$|Analog {{and digital}} pay {{television}} have several conditional access {{systems that are}} used for pay-per-view (PPV) and other subscriber related services. Originally, analog-only cable television systems relied on set-top boxes to control access to programming, as television sets originally were not [...] "cable-ready". Analog encryption was typically limited to premium channels such as HBO or channels with adult-oriented content. In those cases, various proprietary video synchronization suppression methods were used to control access to programming. In some of these systems, the necessary sync signal was on a separate subcarrier though sometimes the sync polarity is simply inverted, in which case, if {{used in conjunction with}} PAL, a SECAM L TV with a cable tuner can be used <b>to</b> partially <b>descramble</b> the signal though only in black and white and with inverted luminance and thus a multi standard TV which supports PAL L is preferred to decode the color as well. This, however will lead to a part of the video signal being received as audio as well and thus another TV with preferably no auto mute should be used for audio decoding. Analog set-top boxes have largely been replaced by digital set-top boxes that can directly control access to programming as well as digitally decrypt signals.|$|R
5000|$|A cable {{converter}} box or television {{converter box}} is an electronic tuning device that transposes/converts {{any of the}} available channels from a cable television service to an analog RF signal on a single channel, usually VHF channel 3 or 4, or to a different output for digital televisions such as HDMI. The device allows a television set that is not “cable ready” to receive cable channels. While later televisions were [...] "cable ready" [...] with a standard converter built-in, the existence of premium television (aka pay per view) {{and the advent of}} digital cable have continued the need for various forms of these devices for cable television reception. While not an explicit part of signal conversion, many cable converter boxes include forms of <b>descrambling</b> <b>to</b> manage carrier-controlled access restriction to various channels.|$|R
40|$|Ciliates are a {{class of}} organisms which undergo a genetic process called gene {{descrambling}} after mating. In order {{to better understand the}} problem, a literature review of past works has been presented in this thesis. This includes a brief summary of both the relevant biology and bioinformatics literature. Then, a formal definition of scrambling systems is developed which attempts to model the problem of sequence alignment between scrambled and descrambled genes. With this system, sequences can be classified into relevant functional segments. It also provides a framework whereby we can compare various ciliate sequence alignment algorithms. After that, a new method of predicting the various functional segments is studied. This method shows better coverage, and usually a better labelling score with certain parameters. Then we discuss several recent hypotheses as to how ciliates naturally descramble genes. An algorithm suite is developed to test these hypotheses. With the tests, we are able to computationally check which factors are potentially the most important. According to the current results with 247 pointer sequences of 13 micronuclear genes, examining repeats which are the same distance together with either the sequence or the size, as the real pointers, is almost always enough information <b>to</b> guide <b>descrambling.</b> Indeed, the real pointer sequence is the unique repeat 92. 7 % and 94. 3 % of the time within the 247 pointers, from the left and right respectively, using only the pointer distance and the pointer sequence information...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are more}} {{advanced}} forms of voice inversion {{which are more}} complex and require more effort <b>to</b> <b>descramble.</b> One method {{is to use a}} random code to choose the carrier frequency and then change this code in real time. This is called Rolling Code voice inversion and one can often hear the [...] "ticks" [...] in the transmission which signal the changing of the inversion point.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from the}} notable {{successes of the}} German navy's {{decryption}} services, there were also some results from the other institutions. For example, the Reichspost was able <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> scrambled voice transmission of the transatlantic telephone connection between the USA and Great Britain. For this purpose, an interception and descrambling facility was built in Noordwijk, in occupied Holland. From 1940, the Mail Service's descrambling specialists intercepted and understood classified telephone conversation between President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The facility relocated to a purpose built bunker facility in Valkenswaard where it remained until August 1944 when the facility had to relocate to Germany, the interception potential decreased, so did the number of phone calls intercepted. This was not classic codebreaking since none was involved; instead it was the exploitation of knowledge about a sophisticated technology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Audio {{scrambling}} can {{be employed}} to ensure confidentiality in audio distribution. We first describe scrambling for raw audio using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) first and then focus on MP 3 audio scrambling. We perform scrambling based {{on a set of}} keys which allows for a set of audio outputs having different qualities. During descrambling, the number of keys provided and the number of rounds of descrambling performed will decide the audio output quality. We also perform scrambling by using multiple keys on the MP 3 audio format. With a subset of keys, we can <b>descramble</b> <b>to</b> obtain a low quality audio. However, we can obtain the original quality audio by using all of the keys. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms are effective, fast, simple to implement while providing flexible control over the progressive quality of the audio output. The security level provided by the scheme is sufficient for protecting MP 3 music content...|$|R
30|$|Original images {{owned by}} an image {{publisher}} are first encoded and visually protected {{by means of}} scrambling in the DCT domain (1 a). At the same time, thumbnails are generated by resizing the original images to any required sizes for viewing in a display device (1 b). The protected images are then uploaded and stored on a cloud repository server. In this manner, the true visual content of the original images cannot be accessed by the server provider. Thumbnails can be stored on the same server, and are publicly accessible through the website. A potential image buyer will browse the thumbnail library and choose images of interest, which also serve as queries (2). When a query image is submitted, the thumbnail is matched with the protected images by comparing the moment invariants of the thumbnail and of the DC-image generated from the protected images (3). After this matching process, the server will return the matched image, which can then be downloaded or sent to the potential buyer (4). However, the matched image remains visually protected unless a key is granted by the image publisher after payment or other authorization (5). Using an authentic key, the buyer will be able <b>to</b> decode and <b>descramble</b> the data, resulting in the true traded image (6).|$|R
50|$|The concept behind Phonevision {{involved}} making Hollywood films {{available to}} home viewers at $1 per movie (equivalent to $/movie after inflation). Viewers {{were required to}} purchase a descrambler unit that sat {{on top of the}} television, plugged into the TV's antenna leads and also into the telephone line. Someone wishing to view a movie would call the Phonevision operator, who would add them to the viewer queue. A signal sent via phone lines would allow the box <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the signal {{and at the end of}} the month, viewers would be billed for the movie on their regular telephone bill. Some of Zenith's 1951 model TV sets were equipped with a special connector for Phonevision, and included a section in the owner's manual explaining the Phonevision concept, providing instructions on how to order, and a schedule for film broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|A typical cable {{communications}} system includes several basic components {{such as a}} service provider, a Cable television headend, a Business Support Systems (BSS), an Operations Support System (OSS), a controller and a customer's Set-top box (STB), {{also known as a}} Cable Converter Box, or simply a converter, or more correctly converter/descrambler. The Set-Top box is a key component in Addressability Systems it is an Integrated receiver/decoder (IRD). Normally, the Headend receives a signal sent by a service provider, which may send the signal, for example, via an uplink (UL) to a satellite and a downlink (DL) from the satellite to the Headend. At the Headend, the signal may be manipulated, for example, by being scrambled, encrypted and having authorization codes attached thereto by a Scrambler. The billing system or BSS typically manages products and services, customers and addressable equipment such as the converters and controllers. A customer's request for a certain service or product is normally forwarded to the BSS. The billing system or BSS sends instructions to the controller, which configures the converter in accordance with the instructions. The controller also communicates with the headend to receive the proper authorization information needed for the particular configuration. This information is sent to the converter. The converter also receives the signal and compares information on the signal to corresponding authorization from the controller. Based on the comparison, the customer's STB {{may or may not be}} able <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the signal and view the content or Television Program.|$|E

40|$|CSA is {{utilized}} {{in almost every}} scrambled digital television channel. The MPEG streams are encoded by this using an 8 -byte seed and that is needed in order <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the channels as well. This seed normally is obtained by a second algorithm; this second algorithm can be any common standard for scrambling. This second algorithm is only {{needed to get the}} seed for the CSA. This means that if you know the seed, then you will be able <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the any channel. The task becomes finding the seed. This seed is 64 -bit which means there are 10 19 different values. We propose to implement the CSA algorithm using C. We will assume that the seed is not created from another algorithm, but rather, it is given. We plan on using a block cipher to encrypt and decrypt the data. We will create an interface that will enable the user to enter plaintext values and will output encrypted values. This interface will also be able to decrypt encrypted values...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enhance data {{transmission}} security within internet network, this paper consider a signature reconfiguration scheme over wavelength-coded network coder/decoders (codecs). We propose the reconfiguration scheme of composite signatures in which optical network codecs reconfigure their signature keys in a tractable way to enhance system confidentiality for coded wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmissions. Based on conventional maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) codes over arrayed-waveguide-grating (AWG) codecs, composite signatures of relative prime-length M-sequence codes are structured to identify network node users. Network codecs change their signatures dynamically such that eavesdroppers cannot {{keep up with}} the speed of code changing, and thus unable to detect the channel waveform <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the code. Evaluated results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach via composite signatures reconfiguration against practical eavesdropping...|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis, a voice {{encryption}} system was programmed as a real-time software application. The idea {{was based on}} a previous graduation thesis and is meant to show an example of the possibilities of signal processing for educational use. The application uses a frequency scrambling technique on an audio signal taken from the computer microphone input and plays it scrambled back to the speakers, or other way around <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the signal. The basic idea is to use a frequency channel decomposition through digital signal filtering and down-sampling. Reassembling these sub-bands in a different order, a scrambled voice signal is the result. In addition, the scrambling process is embedded into a “software framework” which allows the use of an audio data stream from and to a sound card through different APIs so a computer platform real-time application can be accomplished...|$|E
40|$|To provide subscription-based Digital TV (DTV) data, {{services}} providers scramble {{the data}} stream (program content) with some secure {{measures such as}} ECM and EMM via using control words, and send the stream to conditional access system (CAS) in the set-top box (STB). Smart card is used to decrypt the control words and accordingly to enable the STB <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the scrambled signal. Therefore, secure communication between STB and smart card is a key issue to the service providers. The paper discusses and identifies some security issues in previous research works that have focused on secure communication between smart card and STB. Then, it proposes a secure mutual authentication and a key agreement protocol between smart card and STB. The proposed scheme is more efficient and secure than previously proposed schemes in that it eliminates time-consuming exponentiation operation. The proposed scheme also prevents smart card cloning and McCormac Hack problems...|$|E
40|$|In Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcasting, service {{providers}} charge subscription fee by scrambling {{the program in}} Conditional Access System (CAS). This avoids unauthorized users to receive the programs. A smart card (CA card) is used to decrypt the Control Words (CWs) and transfer them back to Set-Top Box (STB) in order <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> the scrambled program. This paper presents a secure mutual authentication and key exchange scheme between STB and smart card for IPTV broadcasting. Its security is based on one way hash function and the discrete logarithm problem. It allows subscribers to choose and change the password freely, provides dynamic session key agreement and mutual authentication between STB and smart card. Security analysis proves that the scheme is strong against subscriber and STB impersonation attacks, replay attack, stolen verifier attack, smart card loss attack, man-in-the-middle attack and attack on perfect forward secrecy which are considered as common threats in IPTV environment. Moreover, the scheme also prevents serious attacks such as smart card cloning and McCormac Hack attack particular to authentication using smart cards.

40|$|Secure image {{communication}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important due to theft and manipulation of its content. Law enforcement agents may find {{it increasingly difficult to}} stay afloat above the ill intentions of hackers. We have been able to develop an image scrambling algorithm that is very simple to implement but almost impossible to breach with a probability less than 5 x 10 −[*] 300. This is possible {{due to the fact that}} a user may purchase or acquire rights for an intended image by specifying a 2 ̆ 7 key 2 ̆ 7 that can form a sequence of numbers 10 to 100 in length. The content provider uses this sequence as a base in developing another key sequence to scramble the image and transmit it to the user through regular channels such as an email attachment. Since the user is the only party apart from the provider to possess the key for descrambling, any third party will not be able <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> it successfully as will be shown in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Ciliates are {{a type of}} {{unicellular}} {{eukaryotic organism}} that has two types of nuclei within each cell; one is called the macronucleus (MAC) {{and the other is}} known as the micronucleus (MIC). During mating, ciliates exchange their MIC, destroy their own MAC, and create a new MAC from the genetic material of their new MIC. The process of developing a new MAC from the exchanged new MIC is known as gene assembly in ciliates, and it consists of a massive amount of DNA excision from the micronucleus, and the rearrangement {{of the rest of the}} DNA sequences. During the gene assembly process, the DNA segments that get eliminated are known as internal eliminated segments (IESs), and the remaining DNA segments that are rearranged in an order that is correct for creating proteins, are called macronuclear destined segments (MDSs). A topic of interest is to predict the correct order <b>to</b> <b>descramble</b> a gene or chromosomal segment. A prediction can be made based on the principle of parsimony, whereby the smallest sequence of operations is likely close to the actual number of operations that occurred. Interestingly, the order of MDSs in the newly assembled 22, 354 Oxytricha trifallax MIC chromosome fragments provides evidence that multiple parallel recombinations occur, where the structure of the chromosomes allows for interleaving between two sections of the developing macronuclear chromosome in a manner that can be captured with a common string operation called the shuffle operation (the shuffle operation on two strings results in a new string by weaving together the first two, while preserving the order within each string). Thus, we studied four similar systems involving applications of shuffle to see how the minimum number of operations needed to assemble differs between the types. Two algorithms for each of the first two systems have been implemented that are both shown to be optimal. And, for the third and fourth systems, four and two heuristic algorithms, respectively, have been implemented. The results from these algorithms revealed that, in most cases, the third system gives the minimum number of applications of shuffle <b>to</b> <b>descramble,</b> but whether the best implemented algorithm for the third system is optimal or not remains an open question. The best implemented algorithm for the third system showed that 96. 63 % of the scrambled micronuclear chromosome fragments of Oxytricha trifallax can be descrambled by only 1 or 2 applications of shuffle. This small number of steps lends theoretical evidence that some structural component is enforcing an alignment of segments in a shuffle-like fashion, and then parallel recombination is taking place to enable MDS rearrangement and IES elimination. Another problem of interest is to classify segments of the MIC into MDSs and IESs; this is the second topic of the thesis, and is a matter of determining the right "class label", i. e. MDS or IES, on each nucleotide. Thus, training data of labelled input sequences was used with hidden Markov models (HMMs), which is a well-known supervised machine learning classification algorithm. HMMs of first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order have been implemented. The accuracy of the classification was verified through 10 -fold cross validation. Results from this work show that an HMM is more likely to fail to accurately classify micronuclear chromosomes without having some additional knowledge...|$|E
