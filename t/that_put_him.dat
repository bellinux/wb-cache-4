5|$|The Giants rallied {{and won the}} {{following}} week against the Minnesota Vikings before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding the Bills' powerful offense to 17 points, the Giants lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound the team's problems, Phil Simms suffered a broken foot <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on the sidelines {{for the rest of}} the season. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, had been with the team since 1984, but had thrown just 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Davidson {{missed out}} on the second session of qualifying, putting his Super Aguri in 17th position, 3 places behind his {{teammate}} Sato. Ralf Schumacher and his team were disappointed with qualifying in 18th. Heikki Kovalainen crashed into the wall at turn 5, damaging his rear suspension and losing his rear wing, resulting in the session being stopped temporarily. Once the debris had been cleared, Kovalainen in his repaired car managed one impressive lap <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in 13th, after which six drivers outqualified him. Kovalainen then had to make an engine change due to an engine failure and was demoted {{to the back of}} the grid. Wurz, Sutil and Albers qualified in 19th, 20th and 21st respectively after being pushed up a place by Kovalainen's engine change.|$|E
5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E

5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming dangerously close to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as he emerged from the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless to reel Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E

Similarly, the narrator of A. M. Homes' The End of Alice deliberately withholds the full story of the crime <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in prison—the rape and subsequent murder of a young girl—until the end of the novel.|$|E

A third-round 65 put him atop the leaderboard and he coasted to victory with a final-round 69 for a 20-under 268 four-round total. This was his biggest turnaround pro victory to date.|$|E

25|$|The Raptors {{underwent}} a significant roster overhaul in the preseason, such as bringing Jarrett Jack from Indiana {{to play as}} Calderón's back-up and point forward Hedo Türkoğlu to share in ball-handling duties. With {{a third of the}} season gone, the Spaniard picked up an injury <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> out for 12 games, resulting in Jack holding on to the starting spot even upon the former's return, paralleling the Ford-Calderón scenario in 2007–08. Still, the pair combined well and helped bring the Raptors to a 21–20 record at the mid-season mark.|$|E
25|$|Congress did {{not deal}} with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but {{incapacitated}} as Garfield was.

It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.|$|E
25|$|Twice he set single-game records, one for {{stealing}} seven bases, {{and the other}} for collecting five extra-base hits. Although he had statistics <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> consistently among the seasonal league leaders, he reportedly had a poor work ethic resulting from an active social life outside of baseball. This behavior did not endear him to his team captain, Cap Anson, which caused them to feud during Gore's time in Chicago. After his career, he had major financial difficulties, having to move from job to job to just support his bare necessities. He {{died at the age of}} 79 in Utica, New York.|$|E

25|$|Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin {{made his}} way to Zuiun-ji, the {{residence}} of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, partnering Bentley in the ruck, Dyer played {{successfully in}} the first half of the season before suffering a serious knee injury <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> out for the rest of the year. In ten matches, Dyer received four best afield Brownlow medal votes, collected enough votes to win the Tigers' best and fairest, although this is in dispute as there is no actual evidence that Dyer actually won the award, or even that there was one presented in 1932, and was chosen for Victoria after fewer than a dozen league matches. On Grand Final day, Dyer was back in reserve as his teammates won Richmond's third premiership after several finals failures.|$|E

Although he supported strengthening security along the U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration, he stated his belief that fellow Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul's plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
