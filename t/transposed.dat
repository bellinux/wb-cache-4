5|$|The {{first time}} the Christmas hymns of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat were printed {{was in the same}} volume as the D major version of the Magnificat, in the 1862 Bach Gesellschaft XI/1 publication, which {{presented}} the hymns in an annex. In that publication the hymns were however not <b>transposed</b> to fit in the D major setting of the Magnificat. More recently publishers offer such <b>transposed</b> (and completed) versions of the hymns, {{so that they can be}} performed as part of the D major version of the Magnificat, for instance Novello in 2000 (Neil Jenkins) and Bärenreiter in 2014.|$|E

However, both types of whistle tones have a phonological structure that is related to the spoken language that they are <b>transposing.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was <b>transposed</b> from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may {{have been replaced by}} transverse flutes.|$|E
5|$|Fischer played 1.c4 (instead of 1.e4) {{for only}} {{the third time in}} a serious game. With 3.d4 the game <b>transposed</b> to the Queen's Gambit, {{surprising}} many who had never seen Fischer play the White side of that opening. In fact, he had previously openly condemned it.|$|E
5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, <b>transposed</b> to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively White can <b>transpose</b> {{into the}} Danish by {{offering}} a second pawn with 5.Bc4 cxb2 6.Bxb2, an approach which John Emms considers far more dangerous for Black. If Black does not accept the second pawn with 5...cxb2, then White can avoid Black's most critical response to 5.Nxc3 (5...Bb4 6.Bc4 d6). For instance, after 5...d6, White's best is 6.Nxc3, <b>transposing</b> back to the 5.Nxc3 d6 line. 5...Nf6 6.Nxc3 <b>transposes</b> to the 5.Nxc3 Nf6 line, 5...Bb4 is well met by 6.0-0 or 6.bxc3 (<b>transposing</b> to the Scotch Gambit), 5...Bc5 also <b>transposes</b> to the Scotch Gambit while 5...Be7?!

5|$|Around 1733 Bach <b>transposed</b> his Latin Magnificat to Dmajor (BWV243). Besides transposing, he also {{applied a}} few modifications: for {{instance}} in the movement that has Luke1:54 as text he replaced the trumpet as performer of the cantus firmus by two oboes. Around a decade later Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably {{around the same time}} Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work for}} five soloists: two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass. The soloists {{are listed in the}} table in the order SATB. For some recordings, only one soprano soloist is listed. Recordings with orchestras on period instruments in historically informed performances are highlighted. The first recordings in the 1960s combined the version in D major (BWV 243) with <b>transposed</b> Christmas interpolations. The type of orchestra is shown for an ensemble with period instruments in historically informed performance by green background.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{scored the}} cantata for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble of two alto recorders (Fl), two oboes (Ob), {{first and second}} violins (Vl), violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc). There are two sets of continuo parts from 1726: one is a score <b>transposed</b> for positive organ with figuration added by Bach {{in the first three}} movements; the other has annotations by the copyist for violoncello and double bass.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then <b>transposed</b> to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be <b>transposed</b> by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E

5|$|Novello {{published}} {{both the}} E-flat major and the D major {{version of the}} Magnificat in a single publication in 2000, edited by Neil Jenkins. This edition also offered a <b>transposed</b> version of the Christmas 1723 laudes {{so that they could}} be fitted in performances of the D major version of the Magnificat. The last measures of the Virga Jesse, missing from the autograph score, were in this edition completed on the base of a similar composition by Bach.|$|E

5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been <b>transposed</b> down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E
