5|$|After {{the artistic}} {{portion of the}} ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is {{traditionally}} the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands it over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} pharyngeal arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward {{from the back of}} the embryo towards the front of the face and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E

He {{commanded}} Army Group South in the Flămânda operation against the Third Bulgarian Army and other forces of the Central Powers, ultimately stopped by the German offensive (Averescu's forces did not register important losses, and orderly retreated to Moldavia, where Romanian authorities had taken refuge from the successful German operations).|$|E
5|$|In a 2016 {{oral history}} of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, {{the voice of}} Towelie {{as well as a}} writer and {{producer}} on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went.|$|E
5|$|Most sources {{place the}} total number of deaths from the war at around 20,000. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Commission for Missing Persons, Colonel Ivan Grujić, Croatia {{suffered}} 12,000 killed or missing, including 6,788 soldiers and 4,508 civilians. Official figures from 1996 also list 35,000 wounded. Goldstein mentions 13,583 killed or missing, while Anglo-Croatian historian Marko Attila Hoare reports the number to be 15,970.

5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage {{over the rest of}} the group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead {{at the foot of the}} descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E
5|$|While his {{men were}} {{clearing}} up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through the cellar ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several more shots into the cellar before rushing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellar stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full {{on the night of the}} game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

5|$|Later Star Wars Legends {{novels and}} comics adopt {{a version of}} the character's image as seen in the film. They also {{elaborate}} on his background prior to the events of the Star Wars films. For example, Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (1992), a young adult novel by Paul and Hollace Davids, reveals that Jabba's father is a powerful crime lord named Zorba the Hutt and that Jabba was born 596 years before the events of A New Hope, making him around 600 {{years old at the time}} of his death in Return of the Jedi. Ann C. Crispin's novel The Hutt Gambit (1997) explains how Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo become business associates and portrays the events that lead to a bounty being placed on Han's head. Other Expanded Universe stories—especially the anthology of Dark Horse comics by Jim Woodring titled Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal (1998)—likewise detail Jabba the Hutt's rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Desilijic clan, his role in the criminal underworld of the Star Wars universe, and the establishment of his crime syndicate on Tatooine in the Star Wars galaxy's Outer Rim Territories.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) {{following}} {{the failure of}} his predecessor, Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, to work harmoniously with the U.S. Army. Command relationships in the North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher's Northwestern Sea Frontier. The troops in Alaska, including Brigadier General William O. Butler's Eleventh Air Force, were commanded by Major General Simon B. Buckner, Jr., who was answerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Defense Command, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt. Kinkaid's command was responsible for coordinating these forces and retaking the Aleutian Islands captured by the Japanese. He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, {{the commander of the}} Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and later the IX Amphibious Force. Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E

30|$|It is {{observed}} that, while the appending operation has time complexity O(n), {{adding a new}} message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> a queue, by consing (cons :) the new message node directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> queue, takes O(1) time. So an alternative method for the appending operation is to add a new message node <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> a queue instead of the tail. The queue created using such a method maintains a reverse ordering of a FIFO queue. Before transmission of a particular queue, a reverse operation is performed on <b>the</b> queue <b>to</b> reverse <b>the</b> queue back <b>to</b> its normal FIFO form. The reverse operation takes O(n) time.|$|R
5|$|Piron {{entered the}} Belgian Army and served during World War I {{as both a}} junior {{infantry}} officer and, briefly, in the Belgian Air Force. He rose through the ranks during the interwar period and held the rank of major {{at the time of}} the German invasion of Belgium in World WarII. He subsequently escaped from German-occupied Belgium and reached the United Kingdom, where he led a re-organisation of the Free Belgian military. Promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1stBelgian Infantry Brigade, he led the unit from 1942 to 1944, including on the Western Front in late 1944. He commanded the Belgian army of occupation in Germany in 1946–1947 and was aide de camp to Prince-Regent Charles and, later, to King Baudouin. He ended his career as lieutenant general and retired in 1957. He died in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The hosts {{scored the}} opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a {{position}} on the right. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uruguayan Football Association, Raúl Jude. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, Bond is {{contacted}} by Aki, assistant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, while watching sumo. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson {{claims to have}} critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise and escapes in the getaway car, which goes to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to Tanaka's office. The stolen documents are examined and found to include {{a photograph of the}} cargo ship Ning-Po with a microdot message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution.|$|E
