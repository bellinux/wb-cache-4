5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Following Game4, {{after the}} Yankees took a 3–1 series lead, The Philadelphia Inquirer accidentally printed a three-quarters-page Macy's {{advertisement}} congratulating the Phillies {{for winning the}} World Series, along {{with a picture of}} a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for <b>the</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E

The aircraft subsequently made a safe departure from Runway 22.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
50|$|Another {{dialogue}} {{reveals the}} differences between the different concepts of responsibility in Japanese and Western cultures.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{language}} {{education is to}} improve communication ability of students by developing language skills. Language skills refer to and explaining. Understanding includes reading and listening skills, explaining includes speaking and writing skills. Individuals express themselves orally or in writing while communicating. Writing is a complex action which developed {{in the process of}} school. In this study, Turkish teacher candidates’ disorders were examined while they were writing. Spotted mistakes were gathered into groups and a new text with similar mistakes was made by the researcher. The participants were asked to spot and correct <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> in <b>the</b> text. Then, <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> they made and <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> they corrected in the new text were compared. It was observed that teacher candidates were able to spot <b>the</b> same <b>mistakes</b> they made when they were made by another participant. In conclusion, it could be said that teacher candidates know about <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> that cause incoherence but they still make similar mistakes while constructing a text. The reasons that caused this situation were researched by debating with the teacher candidate...|$|R
5|$|In 1926, Newt Scamander {{arrives in}} New York City with his magically {{expanded}} briefcase which houses {{a number of}} dangerous creatures and their habitats. When some creatures escape from his briefcase, Newt must battle to correct <b>the</b> <b>mistake,</b> and {{the horrors of the}} resultant increase in violence, fear, and tension felt between magical and non-magical peoples (No-Maj).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, D Company of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion {{had moved}} along the track to Sattelberg {{with the intent}} of {{capturing}} that position. D Company reported that Sattelberg was unoccupied, but in fact had captured Jivevenang, not Sattelberg. When <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> was realised and it attempted to take Sattelberg, it was found to be strongly defended. D Company therefore withdrew to Jivevenang. Unfortunately, the news of the capture of Sattelberg was passed {{all the way up the}} line to GHQ in Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was part}} of the Irish squad that won the UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship in 1998. He made nine {{appearances}} for the Republic of Ireland at under-16 level. He then progressed to the Ireland under-21 team. He was fielded in a game against Albania despite having been suspended after receiving two yellow cards in UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship games against Switzerland and Albania. The Football Association of Ireland admitted <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> and apologised to UEFA.|$|E

5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|Winter, who {{has never}} seen combat, resents the remark. He then takes {{exception}} to what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change {{the attitudes of the}} prisoners, his admiration for Irwin fading fast. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar (Clifton Collins, Jr.), who had made <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of saluting Irwin in the prison yard.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct <b>the</b> <b>mistake.</b> However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of <b>the</b> <b>mistake.</b> The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, {{an error}} in scoring caused the wrong medals to be presented. In this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, {{to account for the}} different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to {{an error in}} the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E

5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing to openly clash with the other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had made <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of}} the Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|In early April, Dangić made <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of {{travelling}} to Serbia, {{where he}} met one of Nedić's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders, and attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly afterwards, Kuntze ordered Dangić's arrest. Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943. The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising, an anti-German rebellion {{which resulted in the}} deaths of 18,000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200,000 Polish civilians.|$|E
