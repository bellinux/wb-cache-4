50|$|Even though Ramsey pricing can be {{economically}} efficient, {{it may not}} be consistent with the government’s goal of providing affordable service to the poor and the rate by which prices change to achieve Ramsey-efficient prices may not be consistent with political sustainability. As a result of these two concerns, the regulator sometimes limits the operator’s ability to pursue Ramsey pricing within a service group. In the case of services to the poor, the regulator may place upper limits on the prices. In the case of services where traditional prices were different from Ramsey prices, there are equity issues in changing from the <b>traditional</b> <b>pricing</b> structure to a new structure, even if the new structure would be more efficient in an aggregate sense. In such situations, the regulator may impose pricing restrictions that prevent Ramsey pricing or that impose a slower transition to Ramsey pricing than the operator would choose left to its own devices.|$|E

A hedonic price index will be built through ordinary least squares regressions.

We will compare our results with another hedonic study about Belgium and with the re- sults from <b>traditional</b> <b>price</b> indices.

Approach: This study utilizes Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk with significant advantage over Value at Risk (VaR), to full truckload pricing when conditions are unpredictable. It criterion focuses on the tail of the loss distribution and provides a measure of the expected loss exceeding Value-at-Risk. Therefore, it was applied to control the maximum loss or the minimum gain within a specified tolerance level to enable more flexible full truckload pricing.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{overcome}} the problems caused by insufficient price variation in estimating a large demand system. For that, we propose a new form of Stone-Lewbel (SL) cross section prices developed under latent separability that explore individual specific variation in the composition of the bundles of exclusive goods. The estimation of demand system under latent separability needs the choice of at least one exclusive good per group. We estimate Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QAIDS) under weak and latent separability using <b>traditional</b> aggregate <b>price</b> indices and SL prices. Our empirical analysis is based on fifteen non durable goods of a Tunisian Family Expenditure Survey Data.
