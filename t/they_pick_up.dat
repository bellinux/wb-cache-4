5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E

In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit.|$|E
25|$|Another wrinkle in {{the issue}} is the unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, nor does it reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact that}} sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E

25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. <b>They</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, come to the rescue. Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster of terrible power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had been sitting on. Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes back to find Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E

500|$|The Wii U version {{features}} high-definition 1080p {{graphics and}} a special mode that allows up to eight players simultaneously. This mode is restricted to certain larger stages and cannot be played online, though additional stages were made available for eight players via post-release update patches. Various modes from the 3DS version, such as Classic mode, feature various changes in the Wii U version, with some modes allowing two players to play cooperatively or {{against each other in}} other modes. The Wii U version also features three exclusive new game modes; Smash Tour, Special Orders, and Event Mode. Smash Tour is a traditional board game-type mode in which up to four players assemble a team of fighters that <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on the board. Players have the ability to change size of the game board, the number of turns, and choose if they allow to have custom characters on the board (not including Miis). In this mode, players earn stat increasing power-ups, triggering various battles and events along the way. Special Orders is a series of challenges set by Master Hand and Crazy Hand, which players can attempt to earn rewards. Each time a battle is won, the reward and the stakes will rise, but if a round is lost, all accumulated prizes will be lost. In Event Mode, one or two players can participate in themed challenges, moving along the path by completion. The Wii U version has vast compatibility with controllers; Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, Wii U Pro Controller, GameCube controller through GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS systems (using either a copy of the 3DS version, or a Smash Controller app released on June 14, 2015). Returning features unique to this version include Special Smash, allowing for unique rules, Stage Builder and Photo mode, which allow players to create personalized stages and dioramas (with a compatible SD card), and demo versions of classic games in a [...] "Masterpieces" [...] gallery. An update on April 15, 2015 added content-sharing features, with a Miiverse stage added for free on June 14, 2015. An update released on July 31, 2015 added an online tournament mode.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} for a bowler to concentrate solely on speed, especially when young, but as fast bowlers mature <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> new skills and tend to rely more on swing bowling or seam bowling techniques. Most fast bowlers will specialise {{in one of these}} two areas and will sometimes be categorised as swing or seam bowler. However, this classification is not satisfactory because the categories are not mutually exclusive and a skilled bowler will usually bowl a mixture of fast, swinging, seaming and also cutting balls, even if he prefers one style to the others. [...] For simplicity, it is common to subdivide fast bowlers according to the average speed of their deliveries, as follows.|$|E
2500|$|Cyanocobalamin is {{one such}} form, i.e. [...] "vitamer", of B12 {{because it can be}} metabolized in the body to an active {{coenzyme}} form. The cyanocobalamin form of B12 does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B12 are avid binders of cyanide (â€“CN) which <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> in the process of activated charcoal purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B12 is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B12 for food additives and in many common multivitamins. Pure cyanocobalamin possesses the deep pink color associated with most octahedral cobalt(II) complexes and the crystals are well formed and easily grown up to millimeter size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Leadhills is ugly beyond description: rock, short heath, and barren [...] Every sort of vegetable is with difficulty raised, and seldom comes to perfection.

Fowls of any kind will not live many days at Leadhills. <b>They</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> arsenical particles with their food, which, soon kills, them. Horses, cows, dogs, cats, are liable to the lead-brash. A cat, when seized with that distemper, springs like lightning through every corner of the house, falls into convulsions, and dies. A dog falls into strong convulsions also, but sometimes recovers. A cow grows perfectly mad in an instant, and must be immediately killed. Fortunately this distemper does not affect the human species.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the cold}} winds of winter {{pass over the}} warmer water of the lake, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{moisture}} and drop it as lake-effect snow. Since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest, the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake {{is referred to as}} the snowbelt. In some winters the area between Oswego and Pulaski may receive twenty or more feet (600cm) of snowfall. Also impacted by lake-effect snow is the Tug Hill Plateau, an area of elevated land that is about [...] east of Lake Ontario, creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall. The [...] "Hill", as it is often referred to, typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern United States. As a result, Tug Hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts, such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers. Lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as Syracuse, with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the United States. Other cities in the world receive more snow annually, such as Quebec City, which averages , and Sapporo, Japan, which receives [...] each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Two street racers, the Driver (Taylor) and the Mechanic (Wilson) live on {{the road}} in their highly modified, primer-gray, 1955 Chevrolet 150 two-door sedan drag car and drift from town to town, making their income by {{challenging}} local residents to impromptu drag races. [...] As they drive east on Route 66 from Needles, California, <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the Girl (Bird), a female hitchhiker, in Flagstaff, Arizona when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In New Mexico, they begin to encounter another car driver, GTO (Oates), on the highways. An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer, and, in fact, seems to know little about cars, a cross-country race to Washington, D.C. is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be [...] "for pinks," [...] or legal ownership of the loser's car. Along the way, GTO picks up various hitchhikers, including an importuning homosexual hitchhiker (Harry Dean Stanton). When GTO's inexperience becomes apparent, he, the Driver and the Mechanic form an uneasy alliance; the Driver even drives with him for a while when GTO gets fatigued.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some areas}} {{tortoises}} {{are more important}} in the diet than snakes, and they displace mammals and birds as the most important prey group in most of Southeastern Europe as well as the Caucasus. Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) made up 55.4% of the prey in two nests in Bulgaria and 52.9% of the prey in 19 nests in the Republic of Macedonia. The same species are also prevalent in the diet of eagles from Greece, but no quantitative analysis is known from that country. Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. When hunting tortoise, golden eagles use a unique technique: <b>they</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the tortoise and fly up to at least [...] above the rocky ground, then drop the tortoise onto the terrain below in the hope of smashing open its hard shell. The only other bird species confirmed to hunt vertebrates in this way is the lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus), although gulls may use a similar technique on hard-shelled prey such as mussels. The larger desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) of North America has occasionally turned up as prey there. Other turtles have been reported as being hunted, such as painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in Washington state and baby loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in Corsica, but essentially are a negligible part of the diet.|$|E
