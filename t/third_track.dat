5|$|A <b>third</b> <b>track</b> along much of {{the line}} north of 96th Street {{has been used in}} the past for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused <b>third</b> <b>track</b> between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E

In 2008, TriMet secured {{a grant from the}} Transportation Security Administration to allow the transit agency to add security cameras to the station. Portland Community College (PCC) began construction of a training center at the station in 2008, with the $25 million facility then opened in 2009. TriMet had planned to build a <b>third</b> <b>track</b> in 2009 at the station in order to allow the extension of the Red Line to Willow Creek using federal stimulus funds, but canceled the project due to projected costs.|$|E

25|$|In the 2015–2034 MTA Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment, two {{possible}} Harlem Line projects {{that would provide}} capacity to deal with increasing ridership and to expand service are mentioned. The first is the extension of a <b>third</b> <b>track</b> from Crestwood north to North White Plains. This would allow for increased reverse-peak service, increased local and express service-the same goals of the original <b>third</b> <b>track</b> project from Mount Vernon West to Crestwood. The second project would be {{the construction of a}} new flyover at Woodlawn at the junction with the New Haven Line.

The <b>third</b> <b>track</b> on the Main Line will aid in relieving the crowding on the Main Line which is expected to grow after the East Side Access project is complete. The project also includes the elimination of all seven grade crossings and will be constructed within existing LIRR rights-of-way.|$|E

25|$|On October 9, 1958, {{because of}} a lack of funds and because of {{community}} opposition, the City Planning Commission removed the project from the capital outlay budget. On July 14, 1959, the third-track project was put into the New York City Transit Authority's 1960 budget. On August 18, 1959, the New York City Transit Authority through an appeal made by the Authority's chairman, Patterson, tried to obtain approval from the City Planning Commission for a $27 million project to construct a <b>third</b> <b>track</b> on the BMT Jamaica Line. The installation of the <b>third</b> <b>track</b> would have attracted passengers from the overcrowded IND Queens Boulevard Line, as there would be significant time savings between 168th Street and Marcy Avenue. The Planning Commission killed the plan in the prior year, because of insufficient evidence that there was a need for such a project.|$|E
25|$|During {{peak hours}} express trains operate {{from the outer}} ends of the Lilydale and Belgrave lines in the {{direction}} of peak travel, using the <b>third</b> <b>track</b> from Box Hill and the City Loop.

Triple track could be a compromise between double-track and quad-track; such a system was proposed south of Stockholm Central Station, but was cancelled in favor of Citybanan.|$|E
