5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now <b>the</b> <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E

5|$|Fewer than 95 deluxe {{editions of}} Agrippa are extant, {{although}} {{the exact number}} is unknown and {{is the source of}} considerable mystery. <b>The</b> <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> Albert Museum possesses a deluxe edition, numbered 4 of 10. A publicly accessible copy of the deluxe edition is available at the Rare Books Division of the New York Public Library and a small copy resides at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, while the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City hosts a promotional prospectus. <b>The</b> <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> Albert Museum's copy was first exhibited in a display entitled The Book and Beyond, held in the Museum's 20th Century Gallery from April to October 1995. The same copy was subsequently also included in a V display entitled Digital Pioneers, from 2009–2010. Another copy of the book was exhibited in the 2003–2004 exhibition Ninety from the Nineties at the New York Public Library. Gibson at one point claimed never to have seen a copy of the printed book, spurring speculation that no copies had actually been made. Many copies have since been documented, and Gibson's signature was noted on the copy held by the New York Public Library. In 2011, the Bodleian Library's Special Collections Department at the University of Oxford acquired Kevin Begos' copy of Agrippa, as well as the archive of Begos' papers related to the work.|$|E

5|$|After the Great War, Moore {{received}} an ex-serviceman's grant {{to continue his}} education and in 1919 he became {{a student at the}} Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him.

In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries.
