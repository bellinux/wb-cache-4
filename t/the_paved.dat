5|$|SH-108 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 11, 1955. The highway was mostly gravel at that time; only the portions {{from the southern}} terminus to Ripley and the concurrency with SH-51 were paved. In 1960, the section of SH-108 between SH-51 and Glencoe was paved. In 1963, <b>the</b> <b>paved</b> segment extended north of Glencoe, to the highway's northern terminus.|$|E

Road constructing activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.|$|E
5|$|By1932, US72 and US78 {{switched}} {{routes in}} Mississippi, with the present-day alignment of MS172 again {{becoming part of}} US72 as initially planned in1926. In1935, the road was paved {{to the east of}} Iuka. <b>The</b> <b>paved</b> portion was extended slightly west of Iuka in1936 and further west by1938. By1939, the section of US72 that would be redesignated as MS172 was fully paved. In1986, US72 was moved to a new divided highway alignment to the south through Tishomingo County. By1998, MS172 was marked on the former two-lane alignment of US72 in Tishomingo County.|$|E

The route was relocated to follow {{the north shore of}} Sevier Lake, which reduced the number of mountain ranges crossed. Although US-50 was moved to yet another alignment, this route remains US-6 today.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>paved</b> {{walkways}} of Delos {{range from}} simple pebble or chip-pavement constructions to elaborate mosaic floors composed of tesserae.

5|$|In 1955, US 98 {{replaced}} the MS 24 designation from US 51 in McComb to east of McLain; as a result, MS 24 was {{split into two}} segments. In 1957, <b>the</b> <b>paved</b> portion of MS 24 west of Woodville was extended further to the west. The eastern segment of MS 24 between McLain and the Alabama border was redesignated as MS 594 in 1958. In 1962, the highway was paved to a point east of Fort Adams. Paving was completed on the remainder of MS 24 leading to Fort Adams in 1964. In 1967, the eastern terminus of MS 24 was truncated to its current location at the interchange with I-55; US 98 {{replaced the}} route between there and US 51. Since then, MS 24 has remained on the same alignment.|$|E

5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. <b>The</b> <b>paved</b> area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved <b>the</b> <b>paved</b> road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of Route 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{designated}} M-149 along {{a gravel}} road in late 1930; the highway provided access from US2 northerly to Palms Book State Park. A second highway, the first creation of M-125, was formed later in 1931 along another gravel road to connect US2 southerly with the Thompson State Fish Hatchery. When US2 was rerouted in the Manistique area in 1936, that highway was moved further south closer to Lake Michigan; M-149 was extended eastward along a section of <b>the</b> <b>paved</b> highway formerly a part of US2 to connect with M-125 at the Indian Lake State Park. From that point south, M-149 replaced M-125 to Thompson. The former routing of US2 became CR442 except for the section used to extend M-149. In {{the latter half of}} 1960 or the beginning of 1961, the MSHD paved the sections of M-149 north and south of the former US2 segment, completely hard-surfacing the roadway for the first time.|$|E
5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved road between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto <b>the</b> <b>paved</b> road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, unpaved road, the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, paved road, and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, unpaved road.|$|E

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this work, the {{influence}} of different components of a block pavement as well as their bearing capacity under traffic loads applied through a road testing machine have been assessed. Additional tests on the main components have also been performed. It has been found out that beside the stiffness of the base course, the bearing capacity of <b>the</b> <b>paving</b> is also influenced by the stability of the laying course, nevertheless attention may be payed at the embedment of <b>the</b> <b>paving</b> blocks, which must be enough to rise the resistance to horizontal displacements. The rigidity of the pavement has been determined by the internal friction of the aggregates relating to <b>the</b> <b>paving</b> blocks {{as well as by the}} interlocking modes of <b>the</b> <b>paving.</b> Beside tests under traffic loads, other tests can be used for the evaluation of the pavement namely the dynamic creep test on laying course materials, the spreading test on <b>the</b> <b>paving</b> as well as the new-designed shear test on the block pavements with the laying course.
