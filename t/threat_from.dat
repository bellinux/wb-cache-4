5|$|Architectural {{historian}} Anthony Emery {{argues that}} the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes {{was intended as a}} largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot. With the increased <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Scotland and the granting of the licence to crenellate, Emery suggests that the inner bailey wall was then constructed to better defend the keep, followed by the outer bailey wall in a final phase of work.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a decline}} in hooliganism in England, death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> English hooligans became {{more common in the}} 2000s. Rio Ferdinand and Peter Ridsdale were targets of death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> Leeds United fans.Swedish referee Anders Frisk quit his {{position}} after receiving death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> Chelsea fans. Reading players Ibrahima Sonko and Stephen Hunt also received death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> Chelsea fans in 2006. Fernando Torres received death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> Liverpool fans. Sol Campbell received death <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> Tottenham fans.

5|$|Brandon Marsh has a {{very low}} risk of {{pollution}} and as such the main <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> man has been from vandalism; in 2007, a fire started by youths destroyed {{a third of the}} Newlands reedbed. This was the second time the reed bed had been targeted, the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{actively}} pursued ways {{to eliminate}} the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Rosas. In 1851, it allied with the Argentine breakaway provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios (led by Justo José de Urquiza), and the anti-Rosas Colorado party in Uruguay. Brazil next secured the south-western flank by signing defensive alliances with Paraguay and Bolivia. Faced with an offensive alliance against his regime, Rosas declared war on Brazil.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the sea.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to {{the decline of the}} prestige of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Namath threw a then-record 4,007yards as the Jets posted {{their first}} winning record, 8–5–1.

5|$|In 1985, Milner-Barry {{fiercely}} {{defended the}} reputation of Gordon Welchman, who had come under posthumous criticism for publishing details about the wartime work of Hut 6.

5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, {{as it was}} then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} eight weeks of the war the bombing {{intensified}} until British bombing operations were suspended in late April 1945.

5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century.

By 1944, {{with the war}} settling down, the City of London School returned to its home on the Victoria Embankment, which had suffered no structural damage during the Blitz. Air raid shelters were built on site as a precautionary measure.|$|E

Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting was used throughout the entire game.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney.

5|$|Over {{a stretch}} of four days, sixteen {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, the Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. The <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Iris prompted the Jamaica National Emergency Operations Center to be activated. Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.|$|E
5|$|The ironclad age saw the {{development}} of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static mines, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw {{the development}} of the spar torpedo, an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
