40|$|Abstract—Coordinated {{multi-point}} transmission (CoMP) {{has been}} widely recognized as a promising technique for improving spectral efficiency in future cellular systems. However, it may require high-capacity backhaul links, which can increase expense. In this paper, we study the cooperative transmission method with limited-capacity backhaul. Downlink CoMP transmission requires the exchange of information between base stations, {{depending on the type}} of CoMP schemes. Either channel state information (CSI) information of all users (for coordinated beamforming), or both data and CSI (for joint processing) need to be shared among all cooperative base stations. The latter method exhibits better performance, but requires high capacity backhaul links. For this reason, we propose in this paper a <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> method under capacity constrained backhaul. We start by analyzing the performance of two kinds of CoMP transmission modes: joint processing and coordinated beamforming with various types of user scheduling. Then we propose a closed-form decision rule, which depends on the strongest average channel gains of the users co-scheduled in the same time-frequency resource.

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks, it {{is important}} to adapt the transmission strategies for each user according to the network channel dynamics in order to optimize the overall system performance. The adaption involves <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> (a user can choose from direct or cooperative transmission), subcarrier assignment, subcarrier pairing (the incoming and outgoing subcarriers at the relay for cooperative transmission need to be matched), relay selection, as well as power allocation and hence is highly challenging. Many previous works only consider a subset of the adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the joint optimization problem using a network flow approach. Specifically, we first show that for given power allocation, the combinatorial optimization problem of <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> <b>selection,</b> subcarrier assignment, relay selection and subcarrier pairing for the system total throughput maximization can be transformed into a minimum cost network flow (MCNF) problem with integer solutions.

30|$|Since {{source node}} in CC {{networks}} (CCNs) chooses its transmission mode {{according to the}} radio environment, actual relay selection {{can be said to}} be under <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> of the source node [8]. The transmission mode can be separated into the direct transmission, the mixture of the direct and the relay transmissions, and the only-relay transmission. The context of the transmission mode in CCNs becomes more complex in CCRNs due to the SA of the PUs. In this paper, therefore, an efficient transmission mode scheme based on the reinforcement learning for CCRNs is proposed to allow the SU source to effectively determine an optimal action for maximizing a given multilateral metric and to provide operations with low complexity through Q-learning that is a type of the reinforcement learning. As metrics for the QoS, it is considered the time delay, the energy efficiency, and the interference to PUs. In the proposed scheme, it is assumed that the channel state information (CSI) between the SU source and the PU receiver is not provided to the SUs. The channel gain between the SU source and the PU receiver is estimated by considering the well-known spectrum sensing threshold technique of CRNs, which is also a contribution point of this paper. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some of the “Related works” section with Q-learning are given as the detailed background and motivations of the paper.

40|$|Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is a {{precoding}} {{technique that}} allows for an Access Point (AP) to transmit data to multiple receivers in parallel resulting in an overall capacity increase. However, achieving these gains requires significant overhead in first choosing the subset of users to serve and measuring the Channel State Information (CSI) between that user group and the AP. Management of this overhead and other Media Access Control (MAC) decisions are key {{to the performance of}} MU-MIMO transmissions. Previous solutions attempt all-purpose approaches which attempt to work well regardless of deployment environment or frequency band. However, through thorough analysis of MU-MIMO transmissions with respect to band and environment, we show that an all-purpose solution will not allow for MU-MIMO transmissions to reach their full potential. In fact, leveraging the differences in MU-MIMO transmission characteristics for different bands and environments to develop separate protocols will allow for increased overall system performance.

Due to limited feedback and hence imperfect IA, there are residual interferences across different links and different data streams. As a result, the performance of IA is greatly related to the CSI accuracy (namely number of feedback bits) and the number of data streams (namely <b>transmission</b> <b>mode).</b> In order to improve the performance of IA, it makes sense to optimize the system parameters according to the channel conditions. Motivated by this, we first give a quantitative performance analysis for IA under limited feedback, and derive a closed-form expression for the average transmission rate in terms of feedback bits and <b>transmission</b> <b>mode.</b> By maximizing the average transmission rate, we obtain an adaptive feedback allocation scheme, as well as a dynamic <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> scheme.

Since the computational complexity is still a major challenge for real-time applications, simplification of <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> is therefore very important. A fast <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm is proposed in this paper. By removing low-probability modes according to the correlative characteristic in macroblock <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> and the statistical characteristic of sub-macroblock <b>mode</b> <b>selection,</b> the calculation of <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> process is significantly reduced. Based on the experimental results, the encoding time can be saved 55. 91 % on average, and in most cases the degradation of video quality is limited in 0. 15 dB with less than 2 % increase of bitrate...|$|R
