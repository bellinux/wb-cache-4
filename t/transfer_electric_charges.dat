40|$|In this work, the {{analysis}} of electroosmotic pumping mechanisms in microchan-nels is performed through the solution of Poisson-Boltzmann and Navier Stokes equations by the Finite Element Method. This approach is combined with a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme, allowing a full treatment of the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann source term which is normally approximated by linearizations in other methods. The computer simulation of fluid flow in microchannels has received an increasing attention recently, due mainly to emerging applications of deep technological signifi-cance. We could mention for instance the microchips and laser diode arrays cooling, as well as flow injection mechanisms in biological micro-reactors. Since the use of me-chanical fluid propulsion in such devices would impose severe practical limitations (like the difficulty to produce components of microscale pumps), surface electric charge ef-fects {{may be used to}} induce fluid flows through microchannel devices free from moving parts [2]. It is a well known fact that ion adsorption, ion dissolution or ionization may <b>transfer</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> to a surface brought into contact with a polar fluid. Through the so called Electric Double Layer (EDL) effect [1], this induced surface charge af-fects the ion distribution of the fluid, {{in such a way that}} these ions may pull the fluid molecules under the action of an external electric field, applied along the length of the fluid microchannel(the fluid flow direction). In a few words, this is the electroosmotic pumping mechanism. The EDL theory relates the surface electrostatic potential ψ and the charges within the fluid at the surface neighborhood by means of the Poisson equation ∂ 2 ψ ∂y...|$|E

It is noted that pointed objects will indeed transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphere and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{a technique}} widely used for high voltage equipment insulation condition assessment. In such applications, an understanding of PD mechanisms, characteristics and development processes is important. In this paper, PD characteristics of three typical transformer oils, aged to different degrees, are examined under AC conditions, using a needle-to-plane electrode system. The PD activity in transformer oil is confirmed as appearing in pulse burst form. Pulse burst characteristics recorded in the study show that the <b>transferred</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> per PD pulse burst increases with the degree of aging. This increase is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the number of discrete PD pulses and by a decrease in cavity formation time.

30|$|The {{prominent}} supercapacitive {{performance of}} NOAC 400 should {{be attributed to}} these reasons as follows: (i) The high surface area could provide a large adsorption interface for electrolyte ions to form EDL, resulting in enhanced specific capacitance; (ii) the introduction of nitrogen-containing groups can not only increase the accessibility of electrolyte ions to make full use of the surface area but also provide considerable pseudocapacitance to enhance the overall capacitance; and (iii) high conductivity induced by N doping guarantees the fast <b>transfer</b> of <b>electric</b> <b>charges,</b> which decreases the device internal resistance and eventually promotes a high-rate property of the supercapacitor [18].|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of classical solutions in the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory which describe vortices carrying a constant electric current I. These vortices exist for any value of the Higgs boson mass and for any weak mixing angle, and in the zero current limit they reduce to Z strings. Their current is produced by the condensate of vector W bosons and typically it can attain billions of Amperes. For large I the vortices show a compact condensate core of size ∼ 1 / I, embedded into a region of size ∼ I where the electroweak gauge symmetry is completely restored, followed by a transition zone where the Higgs field interpolates between the symmetric and broken phases. Outside this zone the fields are the same as for the ordinary electric wire. An asymptotic approximation of the large I solutions suggests that the current can be arbitrarily large, due to the scale invariance of the vector boson condensate. Finite vortex segments whose length grows with I seem to be perturbatively stable. This suggests that they can <b>transfer</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> between different regions of space, similarly to thunderbolts. It is also possible that they can form loops stabilized by the centrifugal force [...] electroweak vortons. Comment: 83 pages, 25 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{dynamics in}} magnetic double layers {{is affected by}} spin-pump and spin-sink effects. So far, only the spin pumping {{and its effect on}} the magnetic damping has been studied. However, due to conservation of angular momentum this spin current also leads to magnetic excitation of the layer dissipating this angular momentum. In this Letter we use time resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect to directly show the excitation due to the pure spin current. In particular, we observe magnetization dynamics due to transfer of angular momentum in magnetic double layers. In contrast to other experiments where a spin polarized charge current is passed through a nanomagnet, the effects discussed in this Letter are based on pure spin currents without net <b>transfer</b> of <b>electric</b> <b>charge...</b>|$|R

30|$|The high {{specific}} capacitance and excellent rate performance {{could be attributed}} to the following reasons: (i) The high surface area provides a large adsorption interface for electrolyte to form the EDL, leading to a great electrochemical double layer capacitance. (ii) The introduction of oxygen-containing groups can improve the wettability of PCHO in aqueous electrolyte. They can not only increase the accessibility of electrolyte ions to make full use of the surface area but also provide considerable pseudo-capacitance to enhance the overall capacitance. (iii) The stable micrographitic structure cannot be damaged during the chemical activation by moderate amount of KOH. Thus, the ordered sp 2 carbon domains can enhance the <b>transfer</b> of <b>electric</b> <b>charges,</b> which reduces the internal resistance and also helps to maintain high rate performance of the supercapacitor.|$|R

These strong contradictions are found due to some reasons including experimental conditions and uncoupled effects between experimental and conceptual factors.

The most important of these mechanisms are 1 D quantum tunneling [11], quantum tunneling [12], and charge hopping [13 – 15] is a current and clear trend.

40|$|Following {{an entropy}} approach, the {{electric}} current can be postulated as {{a flow of}} electromagnetic waves that has an electric potential. Such postulate is verified in this article by results of experimental measurement then it is applied to review Tesla’s discovery of wireless power transmission. Tesla discovered the wireless transmission of electric power during his operation in an entirely new domain of physics based on abrupt discharging of electrostatic charges. He real ized that electrons were not responsible for such discovered phenomena. So, he called the new energy as “Radiant Electricity ”. He didn’t identify that {{the true nature of}} electric current wa s a flow of electromagnetic waves that c an be nor mally radiated through air.

40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{are discussing}} {{the possibility that}} ruminants are able to absorb peptides across the forestomach epithelia into the blood. As a possible transport-model a proton-coupled peptide transport-mechanism, {{as it is known}} in enterocytes in the intestine was adopted. Peptide absorption across forestomach epithelia would have considerable consequences for the understanding of ruminant protein supply, which is so far based on the availability of protein in the small intestine. In this work, ruminal and omasal epithelia of sheep were examined using the Ussing-chamber technique and measuring the intracellular pH on isolated rumen cells. The following results were obtained: 1. The transepithelial active transport of peptides in the intestine is connected to a <b>transfer</b> of <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> and therefore induces in vitro an increase in the shortcircuit-current. No increase could be noticed after adding peptides and peptidomimetics. 2. The determination of net transport from unidirectional transport rates of radiolabled Peptides yielded in negative value for the rumen according to a secretory process. 3. A tertiary active transport process would be inhibited by the addition of Ouabain on the serosal side. No decrease of the transport rates of peptide was detected. 4. Addition of Mannitol (rises paracellular conductivity) to the mucosal side clearly increased transport of peptides in both directions. 5. In enterocytes proton-peptide co-transport leads to a deacrease of the intracellular pH when peptides are absorbed. However, measurements in isolated cells of rumen, did not result in a decrease of the intracellular pH after adding peptides to the surrounding media. On the basis of these results an active mechanism for luminal peptide absoption can be excluded. The peptide movements are very likely of passive, paracellular nature. Extrapolations of the transport rates to the whole forestomach surface led to the conclusion that (passive) transport of peptides is of no physiological relevance. <br...|$|R
