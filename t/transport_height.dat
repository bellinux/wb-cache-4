40|$|A new top-heat-type heat {{transport}} loop has been constructed. It {{consists of a}} heated section, a cooled section, a reservoir, two valves and tubes connecting these components. Water is used as the working fluid. The heat is transported downward from the heated section to the cooled section by utilizing the vapor pressure of the working fluid. This paper explains the principle of operation and describes the fundamental experiments on the {{heat transport}} characteristics of the heat transport loop. The experimental results confirm that the temperatures and pressures inside the heat transport loop vary with cycles corresponding to the valve operation, and the heat is transported continuously by the small vapor pressure difference produced inside the heat transport loop. The effects of heat input to the heated section and cooling temperature of the cooled section are also discussed.

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} for intercontinental transport of aerosols suggests that aerosols from a region could significantly affect climate and air quality in downwind regions and continents. Current assessment of these impacts {{for the most}} part has been based on global model simulations that show large variability. The aerosol intercontinental transport and its influence on air quality and climate involve many processes at local, regional, and intercontinental scales. There is a pressing need to establish modeling systems that bridge the wide range of scales. The modeling systems need to be evaluated and constrained by observations, including satellite measurements. Columnar loadings of dust and combustion aerosols can be derived from the MODIS and MISR measurements of total aerosol optical depth and particle size and shape information. Characteristic <b>transport</b> <b>heights</b> of dust and combustion aerosols can be determined from the CALIPSO lidar and AIRS measurements. CALIPSO liar and OMI UV technique also have a unique capability of detecting aerosols above clouds, which could offer some insights into aerosol lofting processes and the importance of above-cloud transport pathway.

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} using {{a wide range}} of particle densities was performed in an open-circuit, terrestrial-atmospheric-pressure wind tunnel at Arizona State University. The results show that saltation flux equations derived for typical geologic material overpredict the flux of low-density particles. Walnut shells (approximately 1. 1 g/cc) were used in the experiment and correspond to volcanic ash or ice. Less mass is transported by the wind in the case of low particle density because the style of transport is different. There is a direct, counter-intuitive relationship between particle density and <b>transport</b> <b>height.</b> Measurements of the vertical distribution of material show that the low-density walnut shells travel in a zone within 10 cm of the surface while high-density (approximately 4. 5 g/cc) chromite particles travel as 50 cm. Furthermore, the overall saltation rate of the chromite is approximately four times greater than the walnut shells at the same freestream wind speed, even though the wind is much further above threshold for the walnut shells...|$|E
40|$|Dust {{transport}} by {{the wind}} is not a uniform process but may occur in different modes according to source area conditions and <b>transport</b> <b>height</b> and distance. Subsequently, these differences are {{expressed in terms of}} grain-size and fluxes of the aeolian deposits. Transport distances may vary from several tens of meters to thousands of kilometers, while the height accordingly may vary from meters to more than thousand meters. A relation with grain-size distributions may be established on the base of type occurrences of different loess facies. Three main loess populations (and several subpopulations) of primary windblown origin may be defined according to their grain size (dominated by fine sand to very coarse silt, silt and very fine silt to clay, respectively). Each of them reflects a specific aeolian process and transport conditions. It follows that the grain-size distribution of a loess deposit is an excellent proxy for the reconstruction of aeolian processes and wind circulation patterns. Apart from (primary) pure wind deposition loess may also be affected by (secondary) post-depositional processes. Examples are settling of loess particles in a lacustrine setting and reworking by rivers or surface runoff. Although the primary loess characteristics are maintained, reworking processes leave also their imprint in the grain-size distribution as a useful tool for secondary process identification. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Aeolian {{sediment}} traps {{are widely}} used to estimate the total volume of wind-driven sediment transport, but also to study the vertical mass distribution of a saltating sand cloud. The reliability of sediment flux estimations from such measurements are dependent upon the specific configuration of the measurement compartments and the analysis approach used. In this study, we analyse the uncertainty of these measurements by investigating the vertical cumulative distribution and relative sediment flux derived from both wind tunnel and field studies. Vertical flux data was examined using existing data in combination with a newly acquired dataset; comprising meteorological data and sediment fluxes from six different events, using three customized catchers at Ameland beaches in northern Netherlands. Fast-temporal data collected in a wind tunnel shows that the median <b>transport</b> <b>height</b> has a scattered pattern between impact and fluid threshold, that increases linearly with shear velocities above the fluid threshold. For finer sediment, a larger proportion was transported closer to the surface compared to coarser sediment fractions. It was also shown that errors originating from the distribution of sampling compartments, specifically {{the location of the}} lowest sediment trap relative to the surface, can be identified using the relative sediment flux. In the field, surface conditions such as surface moisture, surface crusts or frozen surfaces have a more pronounced but localized effect than shear velocity. Uncertainty in aeolian mass flux estimates can be reduced by placing multiple compartments in closer proximity to the surface...|$|E

40|$|Ozone Depletion Events (ODE) during polar springtime are a {{well known}} {{phenomenon}} in the Arctic and Antarctic boundary layer. They are caused by the catalytic destruction of ozone by halogens producing reactive halogen oxides like bromine monoxide (BrO). The key halogen bromine can be rapidly transferred into the gas phase in an autocatalytic process – the so called "Bromine Explosion". However, the exact mechanism, which leads to an initial bromine release {{as well as the}} influence of transport and chemical processes on BrO, is still not clearly understood. In this study, BrO measurements from the satellite instrument GOME- 2 are used together with model calculations with the dispersion model FLEXPART to study an arctic BrO event in March 2007, which could be tracked over several days and a large area. Full BrO activation was observed within one day east of Siberia with subsequent transport to Hudson Bay. The event was linked to a cyclone with very high surface wind speeds, which could {{have been involved in the}} production and lifting of aerosols or blowing snow. Considering the short life time of BrO, transported aerosols or snow can also provide the surface for BrO recycling within the plume for several days. The evolution of the BrO plume could be reproduced by FLEXPART simulations of a passive tracer indicating that the activated air mass was transported all the way from Siberia to Hudson Bay. To localise the most probable <b>transport</b> <b>height,</b> model runs initialised in different heights have been performed showing similar transport patterns throughout the troposphere but best agreement with the measurements between the surface and 3 km. The influence of changes in tropopause height on measured BrO values has been considered, but cannot completely explain the observed high BrO values. Backward trajectories from the area of BrO initialisation show upward lifting from the surface up to 3 km and no indication for intrusion of stratospheric air. These observations are consistent with a scenario in which bromine in the air mass was activated on the surface within the cyclone, lifted upwards and transported over several thousand kilometres to Hudson Bay...|$|E

To ascertain temporal variations and spatial distributions of mineral dust deposition by wet and dry processes, weekly deposition samples were obtained at Sapporo, Toyama, Nagoya, Tottori, Fukuoka, and Cape Hedo (Okinawa) in Japan during October 2008 –December 2010 using automatic wet and dry separating samplers. Mineral dust weights in water-insoluble residue were estimated from Fe contents measured using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer. For wet deposition, highest and lowest annual dust fluxes were found at Toyama (9. 6 g m − 2 yr − 1) and at Cape Hedo (1. 7 g m − 2 yr − 1) as average values in 2009 and 2010. Higher wet deposition fluxes were observed at Toyama and Tottori, where frequent precipitation (> 60 % days per month) was observed during dusty seasons. For dry deposition among Toyama, Tottori, Fukuoka, and Cape Hedo, the highest and lowest annual dust fluxes were found respectively at Fukuoka (5. 2 g m − 2 yr − 1) and at Cape Hedo (2. 0 g m − 2 yr − 1) as average values in 2009 and 2010. Although the seasonal tendency of the monthly dry deposition amount roughly resembled that of monthly days of Kosa dust events, the monthly amount of dry deposition was not proportional to monthly days of the events. Comparison of dry deposition fluxes with vertical distribution of dust particles deduced from Lidar data and coarse particle concentrations suggested that the maximum dust layer height or thickness {{is an important factor}} for controlling the dry deposition amount after long-range transport of dust particles. Size distributions of refractory dust particles were obtained using four-stage filtration: > 20, > 10, > 5, and > 1 μm diameter. Weight fractions of the sum of > 20 μm and 10 – 20 μm (giant fraction) were higher than 50 % for most of the event samples. Irrespective of the deposition type, the giant dust fractions were decreasing generally with increasing distance from the source area, suggesting the selective depletion of larger giant particles during atmospheric transport. Because giant dust particles are an important mass fraction of dust accumulation, especially in the north Pacific where is known as a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region, the <b>transport</b> <b>height</b> of giant dust particles is an important factor for studying dust budgets in the atmosphere and their role in biogeochemical cycles...|$|E

However, measurements of temporal variations and spatial distributions of mineral dust deposition fluxes are limited {{in terms of their}} duration, location, and processes of deposition.

Mineral dust weights in water-insoluble residue were estimated from Fe contents measured using an X-ray fluorescence analyser. Wet and dry deposition fluxes of mineral dusts were both high in spring and low in summer, showing similar seasonal variations to frequency of aeolian dust events (Kosa) in Japan. For wet deposition, highest and lowest annual dust fluxes were found at Toyama (9. 6 g m − 2 yr − 1) and at Cape Hedo (1. 7 g m − 2 yr − 1) as average values in 2009 and 2010.

The average ratio of wet and dry deposition fluxes was the highest at Toyama (3. 3) and the lowest at Hedo (0. 82), showing a larger contribution of the dry process at western sites, probably because of the distance from desert source regions and because of the effectiveness of the wet process in the dusty season. Size distributions of refractory dust particles were obtained using four-stage filtration: > 20, > 10, > 5, and > 1 μm diameter. Weight fractions of the sum of > 20 μm and 10 – 20 μm (giant fraction) were higher than 50 % for most of the event samples. Irrespective of the deposition type, the giant dust fractions generally decreased with increasing distance from the source area, suggesting the selective depletion of larger giant particles during atmospheric transport. Based on temporal variations of PM c (2. 5 D 2 km) dust layer with weak vertical gradient of potential temperature carry more giant dust particles to Japan.

40|$|Purpose - Many {{researchers}} {{have investigated the}} determinants of workers’ risk-taking / unsafe behaviours {{as a way to}} improve safety management and reduce accidents but there has been a general lack of research about workers’ risk information seeking behaviours or their source preferences for risk information. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether occupational risk information source preference was risk independent (i. e. whether workers prefer to receive occupational risk information from proximal sources like supervisors and workmates regardless of the nature of the risk or the source’s expertise regarding that risk, or if they discriminated between information sources based on the type of risk being considered). Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 106 frontline construction workers who were recruited from a single building site within the UK with the help of the safety officer on site. The source from which workers preferred to receive information about a range of risks was measured using a ranking exercise. Specifically, workers were asked to rank five occupational sources (HSE, Safety Manager, Project Manager, Supervisor, Workmates) according to how much they preferred each one to deliver information about eight different risks (Asbestos, Back Pain, Site <b>Transport,</b> <b>Heights,</b> Slips / Trips, Housekeeping, and Site-Specific and Job-Specific Risks). Findings - We found that supervisors and safety managers were the most preferred sources of risk information overall, but a correspondence analysis suggested that workers’ risk information source preference is risk dependent and might be driven by source expertise. Practical implications - Our findings have important practical implications for the role of safety managers in risk communication and for building trust within high-hazard organisations. Originality/value - To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate risk information source preferences in an occupational setting...|$|R

While several recent studies have used sea surface height contours to index ACC frontal displacements, here altimeter data are instead used to track the latitude of mean ACC <b>transport.</b> Altimetric <b>height</b> contours indicate a poleward trend, regardless of whether they are associated with ACC fronts.
