5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result.

Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer <b>triggered</b> <b>a</b> dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
