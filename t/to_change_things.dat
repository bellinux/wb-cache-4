5|$|Earl Ralph {{had secured}} {{control of the}} castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William {{advanced}} into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at Dol, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things.</b> An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William {{was able to make}} peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.|$|E

It was to oversee the creation of codes of conduct for particular industries that would reduce overproduction, raise wages, control hours of work, guarantee the rights of workers to form unions, and stimulate an economic recovery.|$|E

25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> {{in the world that}} aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked {{to keep them out of}} jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E
25|$|Suazo's {{performance}} {{during his first}} tournament wasn't what was expected (only three goals in twelve games) and combined with conflicts with teammates and coaches. It led to speculations that Suazo had been sold to Argentine club Independiente. However, the deal fell through once the Argentine club refused to pay $8million for the transfer. On 4 January, Humberto called for a press conference, {{and in front of}} television cameras and news media, he acknowledged the fact that his performance and attitude wasn't positive during his first 6 months with the club, but that from now on, he was determined <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things.</b> He was going to take responsibility for his actions and commit himself to work hard to achieve better results.|$|E

500|$|In January 2010, Kevin Greutert, {{who made}} his directorial debut with the sixth film, {{was about to begin}} work on Paramount's Paranormal Activity 2 when Twisted Pictures {{suddenly}} dismissed Hackl and forced Greutert on the project by exercising a [...] "contractual clause" [...] in his contract, much to Greutert's dismay. When Greutert arrived on set two weeks before filming began, he performed a [...] "compressive re-write" [...] of the script. [...] Melton explained that, [...] "He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the Saw films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> a whole bunch {{right in the middle of}} it".|$|E
500|$|The premiere {{episode of}} season eight, [...] "Within", {{revealed}} {{the first major}} change to the opening credits. Along with Patrick, the sequence used new images and updated photos for Duchovny and Anderson, although Duchovny only appears in the opening credits when he appears in an episode. Carter and the production staff saw Duchovny's departure as a chance <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things.</b> The replacement shows various pictures of Scully's pregnancy. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the sequence also features an [...] "abstract" [...] way of showing Mulder's absence in the eighth season: he falls into an eye. Season nine featured an entirely new sequence. Since Anderson wanted to move on, the sequence featured Reyes and Skinner. Duchovny's return to the show for the ninth-season finale, [...] "The Truth" [...] marked {{the largest number of}} cast members to be featured in the opening credits, with five.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was [...] "perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television," [...] it was [...] "much like the last week {{with a little bit}} of been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it," [...] and that the plot was [...] "almost boilerplate for this genre." [...] By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that [...] "the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show needs <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> up." [...] Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; [...] "Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm." [...] In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's [...] "casual surrender", as [...] "in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide. What's this guy's deal? He obviously has a plan." [...] However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again, considering he subdued her in the previous episode.|$|E

500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{injuring}} his hamstring {{during the}} pre-season, Selwood recovered {{in time to}} lead Geelong to an unbeaten record over the first five rounds of the 2014 home and away period. He averaged over 27 disposals, 6 tackles, and a goal during the winning streak until the club suffered their first loss for the season against Port Adelaide in round six. Geelong were defeated a further three times over the following two months, coinciding with Selwood's lower averages of 19 disposals and 4 tackles a game. Despite his overall inconsistent performances, Selwood was nonetheless praised {{for his ability to}} continually make key contributions during games—he kicked the winning goal against Carlton in round twelve and scored three goals against St Kilda in round thirteen from only 11 disposals. Selwood's coach Chris Scott lauded him as having [...] "a mark of a great player" [...] who could [...] "find a way <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> ... and play his best when the game was demanding it" [...] even after [...] "struggling at times within games and when it seemingly isn’t going (his) way". Carlton coach Mick Malthouse similarly praised Selwood as [...] "an outstanding player ... he wills his side to win" [...] and the player he would pick to have in his own team if given the choice. Selwood and the Cats finished the season with a 17-5 win-loss record to qualify in third position for the finals series. In the qualifying final against Hawthorn, Selwood gathered 31 disposals, 16 contested possessions, 9 clearances, 6 tackles, and 3 goals but was unable to prevent a 36point defeat. Needing to defeat North Melbourne in the subsequent semi final in order to remain in the finals series, Selwood accumulated 24 disposals, a game-high 16 contested possessions, a game-high 11 clearances, and 8 tackles. However, he was again unable to prevent 6point defeat and Geelong were eliminated from the finals series. The loss represented the first time that Selwood had experienced consecutive defeats in a finals series with Geelong.|$|E
500|$|In Le Guin's fictional universe, to {{know the}} true name of an object or a person is to have power over it. Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends. Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them. In A Wizard of Earthsea, however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has {{attachment}} to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound {{by the power of}} his name. Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this. Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>things</b> with the creative use of words in fictional writing. Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the [...] "Rumpelstiltskin theory", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as James Frazer in The Golden Bough. Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In A Wizard of Earthsea, Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in The Tombs of Atuan, thereby allowing her to learn trust.|$|E
