5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Sharon and Randy {{that would}} provoke {{significant}} attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|Krishna Gitavali or Krishnavali (कृष्णगीतावली, 1607), {{literally}} Collection of Songs to Krishna, is {{a collection}} of 61 songs in honour of Krishna in Braja. There are 32 songs devoted to the childhood sports (Balalila) and Rasa Lila of Krishna, 27 songs form <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Krishna and Uddhava, and two songs describe the episode of disrobing of Draupadi.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gates {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the various characters or the thoughts of the protagonist. Like many other visual novels, there are specific points in Steins;Gate where the user is given a choice to affect the direction of the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas' doctrine {{has been described as}} an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. <b>The</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Merton (1915–1968) was a Catholic Trappist monk and priest. Like his friend, {{the late}} D.T.

25|$|Moreover, the Barcelona Process {{included}} 6 {{countries and}} institutions participating as permanent observers (Libya, Mauritania, the Secretary-General of the Arab League) and invited observers, {{such as the}} European Investment Bank, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Anna Lindh Foundation for <b>the</b> <b>Dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Cultures, the Economical and Social Committee or the Euromed Economical and Social Councils.|$|E

25|$|Pius XI was {{the first}} pope to {{directly}} address the Christian ecumenical movement. Like Benedict XV {{he was interested in}} achieving reunion with the Eastern Orthodox (failing that, he determined to give special attention to the Eastern Catholic churches). He also allowed <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> Roman Catholics and Anglicans which had been planned during Benedict XV's pontificate to take place at Mechelen. However, these enterprises were firmly aimed at actually reuniting with the Roman Catholic Church other Christians who basically agreed with Catholic doctrine, bringing them back under papal authority. To the broad pan-Protestant ecumenical movement he took a more negative attitude.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ballet}} had been composed, it {{emerged during the}} 1867 {{rehearsal}} period that, without further cuts, the opera would not finish before midnight (the time by which patrons would need to leave in order to catch the last trains to the Paris suburbs). Verdi then authorised some further cuts, which were, firstly, the introduction to Act 1 (with a chorus of woodcutters and their wives, and including the first appearance of Elisabeth); secondly, a short entry solo for Posa (J'étais en Flandres) in Act 2, Scene 1; and, thirdly, part of <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> the King and Posa {{at the end of}} Act 2, Scene 2.|$|E
25|$|Science {{fiction has}} criticized {{developing}} and future technologies, but also initiates innovation and new technology. This topic {{has been more}} often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist Vivian Sobchack examines <b>the</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>between</b> science fiction films and the technological imagination. Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects, but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination. How William Shatner Changed the World is a documentary that gave a number of real-world examples of actualized technological imaginations. While more prevalent {{in the early years}} of science fiction with writers like Arthur C. Clarke, new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized.|$|E
