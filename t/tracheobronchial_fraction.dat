40|$|Traffic is {{the main}} source of platinum-group element (PGE) {{contamination}} in populated urban areas. There is increasing concern about the hazardous effects of these new pollutants for people and for other living organisms in these areas. Airborne and road dusts, as well as tree bark and grass samples were collected at locations in the European cities of Göteborg (Sweden), Madrid (Spain), Rome (Italy), Munich (Germany), Sheffield and London (UK). Today, in spite of the large number of parameters that can influence the airborne PGE content, the results obtained so far indicate significantly higher PGE levels at traffic sites compared with the rural or non-polluted zones that have been investigated (background levels). The average Pt content in airborne particles found in downtown Madrid, Göteborg and Rome is in the range 7. 3  13. 1 pg m&# 8722; 3. The ring roads of these cities have values in the range 4. 1  17. 7 pg m&# 8722; 3. In Munich, a lower Pt content was found in airborne particles (4. 1 pg m&# 8722; 3). The same tendency has been noted for downtown Rh, with contents in the range 2. 2  2. 8 pg m&# 8722; 3, and in the range 0. 8  3. 0 and 0. 3 pg m&# 8722; 3 for motorway margins in Munich. The combined results obtained using a wide-range airborne classifier (WRAC) collector and a PM- 10 or virtual impactor show that Pt is associated with particles {{for a wide range of}} diameters. The smaller the particle size, the lower the Pt concentration. However, in particles <PM- 10, some of the highest values correspond to the fraction < 0. 39 um. Considering an average Pt content in all particles of approximately 15 pg m&# 8722; 3, which is representative for all countries and environmental conditions, the <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>fraction</b> represents approximately 10 % and the alveolar fraction approximately 8 % of the total particles suspended in air. However, from the environmental risk point of view, an exposure to PGEs in traffic-related ambient air is at least three orders of magnitude below the levels for which adverse health effects might theoretically occur (of approx. 100 ng m&# 8722; 3). Therefore, today inhalation exposure to PGEs from automotive catalysts does not seem to pose a direct health risk to the general population. Even though the data available today indicate no obvious health effects, there are still a number of aspects related to PGEs and catalysts that justify further research. First, continual monitoring of changes in PGE levels in air and road dust is warranted, to make sure that there is no dramatic increase from today's levels. Secondly, more detailed information on the chemical composition of the PGE-containing substances or complexes leaving the catalyst surface and the size distribution of the PGE-containing particles released during driving will facilitate a more in-depth human risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette {{smoke is}} {{the main cause of}} lung cancer events. Mainstream {{cigarette}} smoke (MSS) is a direct concern for smokers, but also the secondhand smoke (SHS) contributes to the smoker exposure. In addition, smoker exposure is affected by the “free-smoke” particle exposure (B), related to the micro-environments where smokers spend time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the daily alveolar and <b>tracheobronchial</b> deposited <b>fractions</b> of airborne particles for smokers as the sum of these three contributions: MSS, SHS, and B. Measurements of particle surface area distributions in the MSS were performed through a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, and a Thermo-dilution system on five types of conventional cigarettes. A Monte Carlo method was then applied to evaluate the most probable value of dose received during the inhalation of MSS by smokers. Measurements of particle concentrations in SHS and at the “free-smoke” particle background (B) were performed through 24 -h monitoring at a personal scale of adult smoker through hand-held devices. This paper found that the total daily deposited dose for typical smokers was 1. 03 × 105 mm 2 ·day− 1. The main contribution of such a huge daily dose was addressable to the MSS (98 %) while SHS contributed 1. 1 %, increasing up to 2 % for people smoking only while traveling in a car...|$|R
40|$|Highlights - 110 laser {{printers}} from 7 manufacturers were analyzed in an experimental chamber. - Particle number and mass concentrations, and size distributions, were measured. - Emission rates {{for all the}} printers were calculated under fixed operational conditions. - Daily surface area dose received by employees was estimated from emission rates. - Relatively low total surface area dose (2. 7 mm 2) was estimated for office employees. Abstract Emission of particles from {{laser printers}} in office environments is claimed to have impact on human health due to likelihood of exposure to high particle concentrations in such indoor environments. In the present paper, particle emission characteristics of 110 laser printers from different manufacturers were analyzed, and estimations of their emission rates were {{made on the basis}} of measurements of total concentrations of particles emitted by the printers placed in a chamber, as well as particle size distributions. The emission rates in terms of number, surface area and mass were found to be within the ranges from 3. 39 × 10 8 part. min - 1 to 1. 61 × 10 12 part. min - 1, 1. 06 × 10 0 mm 2 min - 1 to 1. 46 × 10 3 mm 2 min - 1 and 1. 32 × 10 - 1 µg min - 1 to 1. 23 × 10 2 µg min - 1, respectively, while the median mode value of the emitted particles was found equal to 34 nm. In addition, the effect of laser printing emissions in terms of employees’ exposure in offices was evaluated on the basis of the emission rates, by calculating the daily surface area doses (as sum of alveolar and <b>tracheobronchial</b> deposition <b>fraction)</b> received assuming a typical printing scenario. In such typical printing conditions, a relatively low total surface area dose (2. 7 mm 2) was estimated for office employees with respect to other indoor microenvironments including both workplaces and homes. Nonetheless, for severe exposure conditions, characterized by operating parameters falling beyond the typical values (i. e. smaller office, lower ventilation, printer located on the desk, closer to the person, higher printing frequency etc.), significantly higher doses are expected...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an indoor/outdoor {{monitoring}} program {{was carried out}} in a gymnasium at the University of Leon, Spain. Themain goalwas a characterization of aerosol size distributions in a university gymnasiumunder different conditions and sports activities (with and withoutmagnesia alba) and the study of the mass fraction deposited in each of the parts of the respiratory tract. The aerosol particlesweremeasured in 31 discrete channels (size ranges) using a laser spectrometer probe. Aerosol size distributions were studied under different conditions: i) before sports activities, ii) activitieswithout usingmagnesia alba, iii) activities usingmagnesia alba, iv) cleaning procedures, and v) outdoors. The aerosol refractive index and density indoors were estimated from the aerosol composition: 1. 577 – 0. 003 i and 2. 055 g cm− 3, respectively. Using the estimated density, the mass concentration was calculated, and the evolution of PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 for different activities was assessed. The quality of the air in the gymnasiumwas strongly influenced by the use of magnesia alba (MgCO 3) and the number of gymnasts whowere training. Due to the climbing chalk and the constant process of resuspension, average PM 10 concentrations of over 440 μg m− 3 were reached. The maximum daily concentrations ranged from 500 to 900 μg m− 3. Particle size determines the place in the respiratory tract where the deposition occurs. For this reason, the inhalable, thoracic, <b>tracheobronchial</b> and respirable <b>fractions</b> were assessed for healthy adults and high risk people, according to international standards. The estimations show that, for healthy adults, up to 300 μg m− 3 can be retained by the trachea and bronchi, and 130 μgm− 3 may reach the alveolar region. The different physical activities and the attendance rates in the sports facility have a significant influence on the concentration and size distributions observed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} {{evidence of}} associations between increased mortality and ambient particle concentrations suggests that ultrafine particles (smaller than 1 mu m diameter) and their constituents are potentially significant contributors {{because of their}} enhanced toxicity and their potential for greater lung penetration. Measurements of size distributions of potentially carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in urban aerosols show their predominance in ultrafine and fine modes centered about 70 and 700 nm. In this article we present estimates of the regional lung deposition of PAH associated with a typical multimodal urban aerosol and {{examine the effect of}} varying size distribution characteristics on lung deposition. Size-dependent deposition fractions, from a deterministic calculation using deposition probabilities in a lung anatomical model, have been combined with the fraction of aerosol or PAH mass present in each particle size range and integrated over the entire size range to obtain the fraction of pollutant mass deposited in each lung region and the total lung. For typical urban aerosols the fraction of aerosol mass deposited ranges from 0. 48 to 0. 56 in the total lung, with 0. 20 to 0. 26 in the pulmonary lung and 0. 28 to 0. 30 in the tracheobronchial lung. For associated PAH the fractional mass deposited ranges from 0. 27 to 0. 32 in the total lung with a large fraction (0. 23 - 0. 28) in the pulmonary lung and 0. 04 to 0. 05 in the <b>tracheobronchial</b> lung. The <b>fraction</b> deposited is relatively invariant with varying size distribution characteristics like mass median diameter and mass fraction in each mode, making it possible to generalize the results to most locations. Exposure in a polluted urban air basin like the Los Angeles basin, with average PM-TO concentrations from 47 to 87 mu g m(- 3) and particulate PAH concentrations from 0. 1 to 3 ng m(- 3), would result in average daily exposures to PM- 10 and PAH, respectively, of 402 mu g h m(- 3) and of 9. 0 ng h m(- 3). Resulting average daily doses, calculated from the lung deposition estimates, are 294 mu g day(- 1) and 3. 3 ng day(- 1), respectively, of aerosol and PAH mass deposited in the total lung with 142 mu g day(- 1) and 2. 9 ng day(- 1), respectively, in the pulmonary lung and compare with doses from sidestream environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in smoking areas. While it is difficult to interpret the toxicological implications of this dose, these calculations indicate high pulmonary deposition and the risk of delivery of carcinogenic PAH in ambient aerosols directly to the long interstitium. This reiterates the need for detailed study of ultrafine atmospheric aerosols and their toxic constituents in various microenvironments in which population exposures occur...|$|R
