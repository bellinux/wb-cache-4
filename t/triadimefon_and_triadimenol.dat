40|$|In this research, Chinese lizards (Eremias argus) {{were chosen}} as {{laboratory}} animal {{to evaluate the}} stereoselectivity in the processes of metabolism, distribution, and bioaccumulation of triadimefon A validated chiral high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadruple mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for determining enantiomers' residues of parent compound triadimefon and its metabolite triadimenol in lizard blood and tissues. Pharmacokinetic results of single-does exposure suggested that S-(+) -triadimefon was metabolized easier than R-(-) -triadimefon, and RR-(+) -triadimenol was the main metabolic product of triadimefon. During the continuous exposure of two dose (40 mg/kg(bw). d and 200 mg/kg(bw). d), enantiomers of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> were detected in all body compartments, with the highest triadimefon concentrations in brain. However, the triadimenol concentrations {{were not significantly different}} among the compartments. The concentrations of RS-(+) -triadimenol were negative correlated with concentrations of RR-(+) -triadimenol both in blood (r= 0. 775, p = 0. 024) and liver (r= 0. 834, p = 0. 02) in 200 mg/kg(bw). d group, which indicates that chiral conversion between enantiomers of triadimenol might exist in the metabolic process of triadimefon. In all the processes, the enantiomer fractions (EFs) of R-(-) -triadimefon and RR-(+) -triadimenol were significantly different from their natural ratios, 0. 5 and 0. 1, respectively, which proved that metabolism, bioaccumulation, and distribution of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> in lizards were enantioselective. These results help enrich and supplement the knowledge of the stereoselective behaviour of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> in reptile. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} {{of pesticides}} <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> was studied {{in aqueous solution}} and in methanol/water mixtures, in controlled and natural conditions. The photodegradation kinetics and product distribution are strongly dependent on the solvent and on the irradiation wavelength. The degradation rates are faster at 254 nm than at 313 nm. The kinetics is faster in water than methanol. Direct photoreaction is an important dissipation pathway of triadimefon in natural water systems while triadimenol is stable in these conditions. 1, 2, 4 -Triazole and 4 -chlorophenol {{are two of the}} major photodegradation products. The formation of the 4 -chlorophenoxyl radical was detected for both pesticides in methanol and methanol/water mixtures. In methanol/water mixtures the reaction of both pesticides also occurs with 4 -chlorophenolate formation, which increases with the water content. The photochemical studies of pesticides and other pollutants should be made in conditions as similar as possible to those observed in environmental systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Photophysics and {{photochemistry}} {{of pesticides}} triadimefon { 1 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) - 3, 3 -dimethyl- 1 -(1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) butanone} and triadimenol { 1 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) - 3, 3 -dimethyl- 1 -(1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) butan- 2 -ol} were {{studied in the}} solution. The excited singlet states were identified by comparison with the absorption spectra of adequate model compounds, in several solvents. The first excited singlet state of triadimefon is an n, pi* state localized on the carbonyl group, while higher excited states are localized on the chlorophenoxy group and have a pi, pi* character. The lowest singlet state of triadimenol is pi, pi* state, since a methoxyl group replaces the carbonyl group of triadimefon. Triadimefon shows a weak fluorescence from the n, pi* state, upon excitation at both 310 and 250 nm. This suggests a fast intramolecular energy transfer process from the localized pi, pi* state of the chlorophenoxy group to the n, pi* state of the carbonyl group. The photodegradation quantum yield of triadimefon in cyclohexane at 313 run is 0. 022. Triadimenol is photostable, under the same conditions. Two major photodegradation products of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> were identified: 4 -chlorophenol and 1, 2, 4 -triazole. 4 -Chlorophenoxyl radicals were detected by flash photolysis, suggesting a homolytic cleavage of the C-O bond of the asymmetric carbon.

In the field trials, honeybee colonies were placed in four rape greenhouses treated with triadimefon on standard dosage. Apicultural products (pollen, honey, and royal jelly) were collected on a regular basis. Sample preparation and extraction procedure were established. HPLC/ESI-MS/MS method was validated. The respective residues of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> metabolite <b>triadimenol</b> were 0. 03 ± 0. 002 [*]mg/kg and 0. 13 ± 0. 02 [*]mg/kg in pollen on the 18 th day, and both had reached the limits of detection in honey on the 24 th day, while they were 0. 004 ± 0. 0005 [*]mg/kg and 0. 010 ± 0. 0002 [*]mg/kg in royal jelly on the 22 nd day.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} {{of pesticides}} <b>triadimenol</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimefon</b> was studied on cellulose and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) in controlled and natural conditions, using diffuse reflectance techniques and chromatographic analysis. The photochemistry of triadimenol occurs from the chlorophenoxyl moiety, while the photodegradation of triadimefon also involves the carbonyl group. The formation of 4 -chlorophenoxyl radical {{is one of}} the major reaction pathways for both pesticides and leads to 4 -chlorophenol. Triadimenol also undergoes photooxidation and dechlorination, leading to <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> dechlorinated <b>triadimenol,</b> respectively. The other main reaction process of triadimefon involves alpha-cleavage from the carbonyl group, leading to decarbonylated compounds. Triadimenol undergoes photodegradation at 254 nm but was found to be stable at 313 nm, while triadimefon degradates in both conditions. Both pesticides undergo photochemical decomposition under solar radiation, being the initial degradation of rate per unit area of triadimefon 1 order of magnitude higher than the observed for triadimenol in both supports. The degradation rates of the pesticides were somewhat lower in beta-CD than on cellulose. Photoproduct distribution of <b>triadimenol</b> <b>and</b> <b>triadimefon</b> is similar for the different irradiation conditions, indicating an intramolecular energy transfer from the chlorophenoxyl moiety to the carbonyl group in the latter pesticide...|$|R

40|$|Eight "sterol-inhibiting" {{fungicides}} {{were evaluated}} for in vitro activity against Phymatotrichum omnivorum, and all {{proved to be}} very active (EC- 50 values ranged from 0. 001 - 0. 038 ug/ml). Propiconazol received the major emphasis of this research, which included evaluations of phytotoxicity, soil persistance, resistance development, systemic translocation in cotton, and field evaluations for control of Phymatotrichum Root Rot of cotton. Although propiconazol significantly inhibited mycelial growth of P. omnivorum (in vitro) at concentrations as low as 0. 0001 ug/ml within 96 hr, hyphal growth from sclerotia was not affected at 0. 1 ug/ml within the same time frame. However, after 168 hr, or if sclerotia were pre-germinated for 120 hr before exposure, growth inhibition was {{comparable to that of}} the mycelial cultures. It was speculated that the greater level of sterols in sclerotia masked the inhibition of sterol synthesis by propiconazol until these sterol reserves were depleted. After 5 exposures to propiconazol over a 5 mo period, mycelial growth inhibition was {{the same as that of}} mycelium with no previous exposure. This indicated that resistance development should not be an immediate concern. Greenhouse evaluations of phytotoxicity and soil persistance of propiconazol determined that this fungicide can severely stunt cotton if planted into treated soil. Using stunting of seedlings as a bioassy of the persistance of propiconazol in non-sterilized soil, it was found that propiconazol was still active 3 - 5 mo after the initial soil treatment. Through the application of C- 14 labeled propiconazol to the leaves of 5 and 8 -wk old cotton plants, it was determined that no more than 0. 23 % of the applied radioactivity was translocated to the roots. However, based upon these percentages, root weights of the plants, and the amount of propiconazol applied to each plant during a field application, the theoretical concentration in the roots would be 30 - 700 X the in vitro concentration necessary to inhibit mycelial growth of P. omnivorum (EC- 50 = 0. 003 - 0. 006 ug/ml).

Treatment of wild-type M. graminicola (strain IPO 323) with 5 μg of epoxiconazole, tebuconazole, triadimenol, or prothioconazole ml− 1 resulted in inhibition of M. graminicola CYP 51 (MgCYP 51), as evidenced by the accumulation of 14 α-methylated sterol substrates (lanosterol and eburicol) and the depletion of ergosterol in azole-treated cells. Successful expression of MgCYP 51 in Escherichia coli enabled us to conduct spectrophotometric assays using purified 62 -kDa MgCYP 51 protein. Antifungal-binding studies revealed that epoxiconazole, tebuconazole, <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol</b> all bound tightly to MgCYP 51, producing strong type II difference spectra (peak at 423 to 429 nm and trough at 406 to 409 nm) indicative of the formation of classical low-spin sixth-ligand complexes. Interaction of prothioconazole with MgCYP 51 exhibited a novel spectrum with a peak and trough observed at 410 nm and 428 nm, respectively, indicating a different mechanism of inhibition.

The control efficiency was improved by the storage time without negatively affecting seed germination. Due to the transmission efficiency, the fungus eradication in seeds should be pursued...|$|R

Among the pesticides studied, only fenthion, quinalphos, and vinclozolin residues {{were present in the}} distilled spirits. During wine distillation, respectively 13 % and 5 % of the initial residues of fenthion and vinclozolin were transferred to the distilled spirit. Low percentages (2 % for fenthion and 0. 1 % for vinclozolin) of these active ingredients (AI) also passed from the lees to the final-distilled spirit, when samples were fortified at 10. 1 and 26. 1 ppm for fenthion and vinclozolin, respectively. Quinalphos passed only from the lees to the final-distilled spirit in percentages lower than 1 % when samples were fortified at the highest concentration (4. 6 ppm) ...|$|R
40|$|A multi-residue {{method for}} the {{determination}} of 54 pesticide residues in pollens has been developed and validated. The proposed method {{was applied to the}} analysis of 48 crude pollen samples collected from eight provinces of China. The recovery of analytes ranged from 60 % to 136 % with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 30 %. Of the 54 targeted compounds, 19 pesticides were detected. The major detection rates of each compound were 77. 1 % for carbendazim, 58. 3 % for fenpropathrin, 56. 3 % for chlorpyrifos, 50. 0 % for fluvalinate, 31. 3 % for chlorbenzuron, and 29. 2 % for triadimefon in crude pollen samples. The maximum values of each pesticide were 4516 ng/g for carbendazim, 162. 8 ng/g for fenpropathrin, 176. 6 ng/g for chlorpyrifos, 316. 2 ng/g for fluvalinate, 437. 2 ng/g for chlorbenzuron, 79. 00 ng/g for <b>triadimefon,</b> <b>and</b> so on.

40|$|Conazoles {{comprise}} {{a class of}} fungicides used in agriculture and as pharmaceutical products. The fungicidal properties of conazoles are due to their inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. Certain conazoles are tumorigenic in rodents; both propiconazole <b>and</b> <b>triadimefon</b> are hepatotoxic <b>and</b> hepatotumorigenic in mice, while myclobutanil is not a mouse liver tumorigen. As a component of a large-scale study aimed at determining the mode(s) of action for tumorigenic conazoles, we report the results from comparative evaluations of liver and body weights, liver histopathology, cell proliferation, cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity, and serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels after exposure to propiconazole...|$|R
50|$|In Brazil, it is {{recommended}} not to plant seed lots with more than 30 percent black point in order to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment {{may prove to be}} appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against ''''''B. sorokiniana'''''' infection (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, iprodione <b>and</b> <b>triadimefon</b> (Stack <b>and</b> McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993). Seed-borne inoculum of ''''''P. tritici-repentis'''''' can be controlled with seed-applied fungicides, such as guazatine and guazatine + imazalil, but other chemicals are also effective (Schilder and Bergstrom, 1993).|$|R
40|$|Pesticides are {{chemicals}} usually used {{in agriculture}} to prevent possible diseases to crops, such as grapes, caused by parasites. Even {{if most of}} the pesticides are degraded during the wine process, residual levels remain in the final product. The most commonly used pesticides in vine belong to several classes of chemical compounds; among them, triazoles and anilinopyrimidines have been commercially used since the 1970 s and 1990 s, respectively. In this work, we investigated the interaction between {{three of the most}} used fungicides belonging to the chemical classes mentioned above (myclobutanil, <b>triadimenol,</b> <b>and</b> pyrimethanil) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by nuclear spin relaxation analysis. We found that all of the pesticides were able to form a complex with BSA; nevertheless, there were strong differences in their affinity toward the plasma protein. The nuclear magnetic resonance approach used {{on the basis of the}} analysis of selective relaxation rate enhancements of pesticide protons in the presence of BSA allowed for the calculation of the affinity indexes and the equilibrium constants of the three systems. Myclobutanil showed the highest affinity toward BSA, whereas triadimenol gave the weakest interaction with the protein. The differences in the capacity of the three pesticides to bind to albumin highlighted the existence of different binding strengths on the protein. These results indicate that myclobutanil <b>and</b> <b>triadimenol,</b> despite their structure similarity, may have very different residence times in the plasma and rates of clearanc...|$|R

40|$|An isotopic {{exchange}} method is presented {{that characterizes the}} irreversibility of pesticide sorption-desorption by soil observed in batch equilibration experiments. The {{isotopic exchange}} of (12) C- <b>and</b> (14) C-labeled <b>triadimefon</b> [(1 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) - 3, 3 -dimethyl- 1 -(1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) - 2 -butanone] and imidacloprid-guanidine [1 -[(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridinyl) methyl]- 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -amine] in Hanford sandy loam soil indicated that these systems can be described by a two-compartment model in which about 90 % of sorption occurs on reversible, easily desorbable sites, whereas 10 % of the sorbed molecules are irreversibly sorbed on soil and {{do not participate in}} the sorption-desorption equilibrium. This model closely predicted the hysteresis observed in the desorption isotherms from batch equilibration experiments. The isotopic exchange of <b>triadimefon</b> <b>and</b> imidacloprid-guanidine in Drummer silty clay loam soil indicated that there was a fraction of the sorbed (14) C-labeled pesticide that was resistant to desorption, which increased as pesticide concentration decreased and was higher for triadimefon than for imidacloprid-guanidine. In contrast, the batch equilibration method resulted in ill-defined desorption isotherms for the Drummer soil, which made accurate desorption characterization problematic. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall-induced {{peaks in}} {{pesticide}} concentrations can occur rapidly. Low frequency sampling may therefore largely underestimate maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes. Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2  min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole <b>and</b> <b>Triadimenol)</b> <b>and</b> one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387  μg L−  1. Samples {{from all of}} the runoff events exceeded the legal limit of 0. 1  μg L−  1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013 / 39 /EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25 %). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30 - or 4 -fold underestimation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52 %), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent. Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Q hysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport...|$|R
