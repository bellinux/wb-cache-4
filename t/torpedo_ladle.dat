40|$|Abstract To {{inspect the}} {{refractory}} of <b>torpedo</b> <b>ladle</b> car at high temperature {{is effective in}} expanding its service life and reducing its maintenance cost, preventing metal break out. As to metal impact area, the refractory thickness could not be inspected by thermal analysis of outer steel shell. The refractory thickness meter was installed at torpedo repair shop for evaluating its measurement stability and refractory thickness measurement accuracy. It has two surface profile maters using laser rangefinder equipped with two tilt stages, facing each other. It measures the inner refractory profile and the outer steel shell profile at one time to calculate the accurate refractory thickness without influence {{of the outer shell}} deformation. After 90 minutes from discharging molten iron, it could achieve stable measurement without the influence of fume and heat haze, and could measure the refractory thickness with a good accuracy of 7. 3 mm (1 sigma) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{of these other}} shapes {{is known as a}} drum ladle and is shaped as a {{horizontal}} cylinder suspended between two bogies. Large versions, often having capacities in excess of 100 tonnes are used in steel mills are often referred to as <b>torpedo</b> <b>ladles.</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ladles</b> are commonly used to transport liquid iron from a blast furnace {{to another part of the}} steel mill. Some versions are even adapted so that they can be carried on special bogies that can be transported by either road or rail.|$|R

The task is visual identification of <b>torpedo</b> <b>ladles</b> at a Blast Furnace wlahdilceh. is achieved by reading numbers attached to each 3. IMPLEMENTATION Number recognition is achieved through use of feature extraction using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The novelty in the method used in this application is that the features the MLP is being trained to extract are undefined before the MLP is initialised. The results of the MLP processing are passed to a decision tree for analysis and final classification of each object within the image. This technique is achieving a recognition rate on previously unseen images of greater than 80...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{techniques}} are powerful in determining inputs {{to a process}} that will drive its output to a desired target. Thisinverse control problem reduces to minimizing a positive cost function that measures {{the difference between the}} output andits target value. In this paper, we present a method for inverse control that uses a combination of artificial neural net modelingand optimization. We apply this method to the desulphurization of hot metal process. In this steel industry application, thesulphur content of hot metal, obtained at the end of calcium carbide powder injection into 400 ton <b>torpedo</b> <b>ladles</b> is predictedas a function of hot metal weight, treatment time, initial sulphur content, gas flow rate, and powder injection rate. Based onthe prediction model, the optimization algorithm coordinates the five inputs or part of them to achieve a desired sulphurcontent in the hot metal...|$|R
