40|$|This {{paper will}} address a current problem in Close Air Support (CAS) {{targeting}} and {{a solution that}} should greatly enhance our C 2 operations in the Global War on Terror. During CAS operations, a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) is a qualified Service member who, from a forward position on the ground, directs the actions of combat aircraft engaged in CAS and other offensive operations. Oftentimes the CAS pilot is required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the target <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> before weapons delivery. The target "talk-on" from the JTAC to the CAS pilot can take too long for timely target engagement.

40|$|Numerous grant funding calls, as well {{as public}} and {{scientific}} debates are now focusing on the cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While {{it is important that}} we search for the cause(s) of the disorder - in order to improve support, education, employment and so on for those on the spectrum - such an approach is problematic for two reasons. First, there is an implicit suggestion that the quest for a cause will be simple and thus achievable. Second, there is a general assumption that there will be a unitary (single) cause to explain all of the wide ranging behaviours seen within an individual with ASD, {{as well as}} across the spectrum of the condition. With the development of molecular and behavioural genetic research programmes, as well as neuroimaging research, this quest <b>has</b> appeared <b>to</b> many <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an end <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> Despite the wealth of superb minds focused on understanding the condition, why, then, <b>have</b> we failed <b>to</b> identify one (or more) causes of ASD...|$|R
50|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by a centrally located command post/plotting room. Sightings of suspicious aircraft were relayed to the post for action by Fighter Sector Headquarters which was in turn in communication with observer units. Within the command post were pits for a height finder and predictor. Each gun <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> of the height predictor, which could {{be no more than}} 10 feet above or below any gun. Further displacement caused errors, as the predictor could only solve deflection (angle). To find the height of an aircraft, a separate height finder <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be used. A kitchen, showers, latrines and three sleeping quarters were located to the northern extremity of the site next to Hemmant road. It is likely that these structures were prefabricated facilities. No evidence of these buildings remains. One of the four magazines constructed as part of the battery has also been demolished in the years {{since the end of the}} war.|$|R

It was restored the same year by John Doubleday, and then again in 1948–49 by J. W. R. Axtell. By 1988 the adhesive used was [...] "very yellow and brittle, with poor adhesion", and Williams, who five years earlier had been made Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass, was tasked alongside his assistant, Sandra Smith, with restoring the vase for a third time.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the measures taken by {{prisoners of war}} {{to cope with the}} humiliation of capture and incarceration, with particular examples drawn from the experiences of British and Commonwealth troops in German camps. For members of the armed forces, whether professional soldiers or volunteers, the process of humiliation began at the moment of capture. It was after all an admission of failure whether in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers, failed lines of communication, or simply running out of ammunition. Suddenly they found themselves deracinated and individually helpless as they began the long marches to prisoner-of-war camps or were loaded into overcrowded cattle trucks for a journey that might take several days. At least, however, {{there was a sense of}} eventual destination. Yet arrival marked the beginning of a very different kind of humiliation, as personal belongings were stripped away and as they were reduced to undifferentiated members of a herd: it reinforced the sense of pointlessness and loss of temporality. Time now stood still. Many succumbed, overwhelmed by being cut off from the past and facing a future that seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no end <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> Yet others developed strategies of mutual reinforcement. Typically, these involved the creation of communities of interest within which memory, both in its collective and public manifestations, played a key role. Of these the most significant and enduring were the concert parties and theatrical organisations which flourished in all prisoner-of-war camps...|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Lincei" [...] (lynx) {{came from}} Giambattista della Porta's book [...] "Magia Naturalis," [...] which had an {{illustration}} of the fabled cat on the cover and the words [...] "...with lynx like eyes, examining those things which manifest themselves, so that having observed them, he may zealously use them". Accademia dei Lincei's symbols were both a lynx and an eagle; animals with, or reputed <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> keen <b>sight</b> (<b>in</b> classical and medieval bestiaries the lynx was reputed {{to be able to}} see through rock and [...] "new walls"). [...] The academy's motto, chosen by Cesi, was: [...] "Take care of small things if you want to obtain the greatest results" [...] (minima cura si maxima vis). According to T. O'Conor Sloane, their other motto was Sagacius ista. When Cesi visited Naples, he met with many scientists in fields of interest to him including the botanist, Fabio Colonna, the natural history writer, Ferrante Imperato, and the polymath della Porta. Della Porta was impressed with Cesi, and dedicated three works to the Linceans including a treatise on distillation called De Distillatione, a book on curvilinear geometry called Elementa Curvilinea, and The Transformations of the Atmosphere. Della Porta encouraged Cesi to continue with his endeavours. Giambattista della Porta joined Cesi's academy in 1610. While in Naples, Cesi also met with Nardo Antonio Recchi to negotiate the acquisition of a collection of material describing Aztec plants and animals written by Francisco Hernández de Toledo. This collection of material would eventually become the Tesoro Messicano (Mexican Treasury).|$|R
40|$|Using Amdahl’s {{law as a}} metric, {{the authors}} {{illustrate}} a technique for developing efficient code on massively par-allel processor performance-class networks to solve nontrivial, high performance scientific problems. They also show the importance of collective communication within the message-passing interface paradigm for some appli-cations. Given the popularity of Beowulf-like clusters of workstations, this work also indicates {{the necessity of a}} scalable high performance network for obtaining efficient performance in parallel code. Using this approach, the au-thors were able to obtain an effective speedup (compari-son with the best sequential time) of 170 when using 256 of the Cray T 3 E 900 processing elements to solve a car-bon, molecular-dynamic problem. The authors also exam-ine the approach on a very different application:a Lanczos eigenvalue solver. Creating efficient parallel codes is a complex process that does not appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a solution <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> (Kuck, 1996). <b>In</b> this paper, we illustrate how one can use Amdahl’s law to analyze the characteristics of a program to achieve sig-nificant speedup. One can extend Amdahl’s law to incor-porate the most important factors limiting performance (Horoi and Enbody, 1998) : • the magnitude of the sequential fraction of the code, • the communication overhead, and • the work imbalance on different processors. This report describes the quantitative analysis of these factors and the solutions used to diminish or eliminate their contribution in two case studies. Using this approach, we were able to obtain an effec-tive speedup (comparison with the best sequential time) of 170 when using 256 of the Cray T 3 E 900 processing el-ements (PEs). To understand the factors responsible for the limited performance of parallel codes, we turn to Amdahl’s law (Amdahl, 1967). Extending Amdahl, the speedup S can be given b...|$|R
25|$|The {{reason for}} the charges against Holmes was that his success {{exceeded}} even the most unreasonable expectations, and that he was, diplomatically, a convenient scapegoat (a fact of which he seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been aware). <b>In</b> <b>sight</b> of the Dutch base at Gorée he took the West Indiaman Brill on 27 December 1663. Stirring up the Portuguese, Africans, and even such Dutch merchants as had a grudge against the WIC, he sank 2 ships and captured 2 others under the guns of Gorée (22 January 1664), {{and the next day}} took possession of the fort itself. On 28 March, in a tactically cunning action, he took Goulden Lyon meanwhile named Walcheren (taken into the Royal Navy as a fourth-rate). On 10 April he captured Anta Castle on the Gold Coast and several other small strongholds and ships. But the greatest coup was the capture of the principal Dutch base in West Africa, Cape Coast Castle near El Mina, on 1 May. Contrary to the popular picture, Holmes <b>had</b> no hand <b>in</b> the capture of New Amsterdam. In August, Michiel de Ruyter had clandestinely been sent to undo what Holmes had achieved. De Ruyter recaptured everything Holmes had conquered, except for Cape Coast Castle, which meant that after 1664, the English were on that coast to stay. His return to England was desultory, as he tried to make out the repercussions his actions <b>had</b> evoked <b>in</b> London. Since he commanded navy ships, everything he had taken was not automatically the company's property, but would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be cleared by Admiralty Courts to be prizes of Holmes and his men. Since Holmes's booty in merchandise was far behind the company's (unreasonable) expectations, he was twice committed to the Tower (9 January and 14 February 1665), where he was interrogated by secretaries of state Henry Bennet and William Morrice. This situation was resolved by the Dutch declaration of 22 February that they would retaliate against British shipping, a direct consequence of the goings-on in Africa, that the British conveniently interpreted as a declaration of war.|$|R
