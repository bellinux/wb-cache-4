Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within <b>the</b> <b>cohort</b> Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
5|$|These were cohortes with a cavalry {{contingent}} attached. There {{is evidence}} that their numbers expanded {{with the passage of}} time. Only about 40% of attested cohortes are specifically attested as equitatae in inscriptions, which is probably the original Augustan proportion. A study of units stationed in Syria in the mid-2nd century found that many units which did not carry the equitata title did in fact contain cavalrymen e.g. by discovery of a tombstone of a cavalryman attached to <b>the</b> <b>cohort.</b> This implies that by that time, at least 70% of cohortes were probably equitatae. The addition of cavalry to a cohort obviously enabled it to carry out a wider range of independent operations. A cohors equitata was in effect a self-contained mini-army.|$|E

5|$|The legions, {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of <b>the</b> <b>cohort</b> army remained {{much the same as}} in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E
25|$|Cohort studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>cohort</b> study; this usually means that they should be disease free when <b>the</b> <b>cohort</b> study starts. <b>The</b> <b>cohort</b> is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} the cancer risks of four different Finnish asbestos-exposed cohorts. We also explored if <b>the</b> <b>cohorts</b> with varying profiles of asbestos exposure exhibited varying relative risks of cancer. Methods: The incident cancer cases for <b>the</b> asbestos-exposed worker <b>cohorts</b> were updated {{to the end}} of 2012 using the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. <b>The</b> previously formed <b>cohorts</b> consisted of asbestos mine workers, asbestosis patients, asbestos sprayers, and workers who had taken part in a screening study based on asbestos exposure at work. Results: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for mesothelioma varied from about threefold to >  100 -fold in <b>the</b> different <b>cohorts.</b> In <b>the</b> screening <b>cohort</b> <b>the</b> SIR for mesothelioma was highest in 2003 – 2007, In other cohorts it was more constant in 5 -year period inspection. The SIR for lung cancer was about twofold to tenfold in all except <b>the</b> screening <b>cohort.</b> Asbestos sprayers were at the highest risk of mesothelioma and lung cancer. Conclusion: The SIR for mesothelioma is high in all of <b>the</b> <b>cohorts</b> that represent different kinds of asbestos exposure. The smaller SIR for mesothelioma in <b>the</b> screening <b>cohort</b> with lowest level of asbestos exposure might suggest dose-responsiveness between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. It does seem that the highest risk of lung cancer in these <b>cohorts</b> except in <b>the</b> youngest of <b>the</b> <b>cohorts,</b> <b>the</b> screening <b>cohort,</b> is over. <b>The</b> highest SIR for lung cancer of the asbestosis patient and sprayers cohort is explained by their heavy asbestos exposure...|$|R

40|$|Two cohorts of {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) {{patients were}} identified. One incidence-based cohort from Harris County, Texas with 97 cases, {{and the other a}} clinic referral series from an ALS clinic in Houston, Texas with 439 cases were followed-up to evaluate the prognosis of ALS. The overall Kaplan-Meier 3 -year survival after diagnosis was similar, 0. 287 for <b>the</b> incidence <b>cohort</b> and 0. 313 for <b>the</b> referral <b>cohort.</b> However, <b>the</b> 5 -year survival was much lower for <b>the</b> incidence <b>cohort</b> than <b>the</b> referral <b>cohort</b> (0. 037 vs. 0. 206). The large difference in 5 -year survival was thought to be the results of a stronger unfavorable effect of the prognostic factors in <b>the</b> incidence <b>cohort</b> than in <b>the</b> referral <b>cohort.</b> ^ Cohort-specific Weibull regression models were derived to evaluate the cohort-specific prognostic factors and survival probability with adjustment of certain prognostic factors. ^ The major prognostic factors were: age at diagnosis, bulbar onset, black ethnicity, and positive family history of ALS in both cohorts. Female gender, simultaneous upper and lower extremities onset were specifically unfavorable factors in <b>the</b> incidence <b>cohort.</b> In <b>the</b> incidence <b>cohort</b> <b>the</b> prognosis was relatively favorable for cases with duration from onset to diagnosis longer than 4 months, however in <b>the</b> referral <b>cohort</b> <b>the</b> relatively favorable prognosis only occurred in cases with duration from onset to diagnosis 1 year or longer and was strongest in cases with duration 5 years and longer.
