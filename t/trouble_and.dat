5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, {{escorted by}} a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed engine <b>trouble</b> <b>and</b> had to return to base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine <b>trouble</b> <b>and</b> crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E
5|$|Pericles' {{manner of}} thought and rhetorical {{charisma}} {{may have been in}} part products of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of <b>trouble</b> <b>and</b> skepticism about divine phenomena.

5|$|As a young man, Turkey Tolson {{worked in}} {{construction}} {{and as a}} stockman around Haasts Bluff, and was a skilled spear-thrower. He only came to know his birth country in 1959, after his initiation. He married and with {{his family moved to}} Papunya, Northern Territory {{at the time of its}} construction. His first wife died, and after remarrying to Mary Napanungka in 1984 he moved to Kintore, which lies within his family's traditional country.

5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} had hit another period of {{financial}} <b>trouble,</b> <b>and</b> Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot. After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} <b>trouble,</b> <b>and</b> most lines were leased to the ECR.

In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's <b>Trouble,</b> <b>and</b> Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the <b>trouble,</b> <b>and</b> patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
