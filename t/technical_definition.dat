Oregon's geographical center is further west {{than any of the}} other 48 contiguous states (although the westernmost point of the lower 48 states is in Washington). Central Oregon's geographical features range from high desert and volcanic rock formations resulting from lava beds. The Oregon Badlands Wilderness is in this region of the state.|$|E
500|$|A <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of {{an atomic}} line filter is as an [...] "ultra-narrow-band, large-acceptance-angle, {{isotropic}} optical filter". [...] "Ultra-narrow-band" [...] defines the thin range of frequencies that an ALF may accept; an ALF generally has a passband {{on the order}} of 0.001nanometer. That atomic line filters also have wide acceptance angles (near 180°) is another important characteristic of the devices; conventional dielectric filters based on the spacing of reflective or refractive layers change their effective spacing when light enters at an angle.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{however, the}} term [...] "video game" [...] has {{completely}} shed its purely <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> and encompasses {{a wider range}} of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term [...] "video game" [...] now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display. Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games.|$|E

500|$|In a road network, {{congestion}} can {{be considered}} a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference. [...] However, this <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "video game" [...] {{has evolved}} over the decades from a purely <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> to a general concept {{defining}} {{a new class of}} interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game, there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode ray tube (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen. This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems. From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called [...] "electronic games" [...] or [...] "computer games".|$|E
500|$|Sustained wind speeds are {{reported}} globally at a [...] height and are averaged over a 10‑minute time frame. The United States reports winds over a 1‑minute average for tropical cyclones, and a 2‑minute average within weather observations. India typically reports winds over a 3‑minute average. Knowing the wind sampling average is important, as {{the value of}} a one-minute sustained wind is typically 14% greater than a ten-minute sustained wind. A short burst of high speed wind is termed a wind gust, one <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of a wind gust is: the maxima that exceed the lowest wind speed measured during a ten-minute time interval by [...] A squall is a doubling of the wind speed above a certain threshold, which lasts for a minute or more.|$|E

500|$|Both {{senses of}} sea date to Old English; the larger sense has {{required}} a definite article since Early Middle English. As the term {{has been applied}} over time, there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans, although seas are smaller and are usually bounded by land masses (and ones smaller scale than continents), the singular standard exception being the Sargasso Sea, which is created by the four currents bounding what is termed the North Atlantic Gyre. Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water. While the defining elements of size and being bounded are generally used, there is no formally accepted <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of [...] "sea" [...] among oceanographers. In international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that all the ocean is [...] "the sea".|$|E
500|$|With {{necessary}} funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board {{approved the}} development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strauß stated afterwards that [...] "Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a [...] "4" [...] in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.|$|E
500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E

2500|$|Type Ia supernovae {{can be used}} as [...] "standard candles" [...] {{to measure}} extragalactic distances, which can in turn be used to measure how fast the {{universe}} has expanded in the past. The data indicates that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, the cause of which is usually ascribed to dark energy. Since observations indicate the universe is almost flat, we expect the total energy density of everything in the universe to sum to 1 (Ωtot ~ 1). The measured dark energy density is ΩΛ = ~0.690; the observed ordinary matter energy density is Ωm = ~0.0482 and the energy density of radiation is negligible. This leaves a missing Ωdm = ~0.258 that nonetheless behaves like matter (see <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> section above) – dark matter.|$|E

2500|$|In {{modern times}} various people {{claim to be}} pope and, though they do not fit the <b>technical</b> <b>definition</b> of [...] "antipope", are {{sometimes}} referred to as such.

It is [quasi] direct recognition to receive its ambassadors, ministers, agents, or commissioners officially. A concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them. No one of these proceedings will [be borne] pass [unnoticed] unquestioned by the United States in this case.|$|E
6000|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} bricks, clubs, and bullets, the selfish laborer finds it necessary to express his feelings in speech.

The sentimental connotation of [...] "scab" [...] is as terrific as that of [...] "traitor" [...] or [...] "Judas," [...] and a sentimental definition would be as deep and varied as the human heart.
