40|$|SummaryThe human {{mitochondrial}} transcription termination factor mTERF plays {{a central}} role in the control <b>of</b> heavy-strand rDNA <b>transcription</b> by promoting initiation, besides <b>termination,</b> <b>of</b> this <b>transcription.</b> However, until now, the mechanism underlying this stimulation <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> by mTERF was not understood. In the present work, addition of mTERF to a HeLa cell mitochondrial lysate-based reaction mixture containing an artificial rDNA template did indeed specifically stimulate rDNA transcription. This stimulation required that mTERF be simultaneously bound to the rDNA transcription termination and initiation sites in the same molecule, thus forming a loop. Most significantly, a double binding of mTERF to the rDNA molecule, with resulting loop formation, was also shown in vivo. These results strongly suggest that, to satisfy the need for high rate <b>of</b> rDNA <b>transcription,</b> human mitochondrial rRNA synthesis involves mTERF-mediated rDNA looping that promotes recycling <b>of</b> the <b>transcription</b> machinery...|$|R

50|$|The {{attenuator}} sequence at domain 1 contains {{instruction for}} peptide synthesis that requires tryptophans.

50|$|Also mRNAs {{accumulate}} {{according to}} the order of protein sequences on the genome, and this solves the logistics problem in the cell. For example, N protein is needed too much for the virus, because it coats outside of the replicated genomes completely.

50|$|Attenuation (in genetics) is a {{proposed}} mechanism {{of control in}} some bacterial operons which results in premature <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> {{and is based on}} the fact that, in bacteria, transcription and translation proceed simultaneously. Attenuation involves a provisional stop signal (attenuator), located in the DNA segment that corresponds to the leader sequence of mRNA. During attenuation, the ribosome becomes stalled (delayed) in the attenuator region in the mRNA leader. Depending on the metabolic conditions, the attenuator either stops transcription at that point or allows read-through to the structural gene part of the mRNA and synthesis of the appropriate protein.|$|E

50|$|Resistance {{mutations}} {{are found}} and become problematic in many viruses other than HIV. Notable {{examples of such}} viruses include the herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B virus.

As a result, mutations in the viral DNA polymerase that make it resistant to these drugs are selected for, which ultimately can cause complete resistance of the treatment. In hepatitis B, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are used to cause early <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> viral <b>transcription.</b> Mutations in viral reverse transcriptase can cause the enzyme to not incorporate these nonfunctional analogs, in favor for their natural counterparts.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{important}} consequences that temperature down-shift has on cells is stabilization of secondary structures of RNAs.

Several cold shock proteins are produced to counteract these effects and thus allow cold acclimatization of the cell. The main RNA modulating cold shock proteins of E. coli can be broadly divided into two categories, (i) the CspA family proteins, which mainly affect the transcription and possibly translation at low temperature through their RNA chaperoning function and (ii) RNA helicases and exoribonucleases that stimulate RNA degradation at low temperature through their RNA unwinding activity...|$|R

50|$|In contrast, a {{low level}} of {{tryptophan}} means that the ribosome will stall at domain 1, causing the domains 2 and 3 to form a different hairpin structure that does not signal <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> Therefore, the rest of the operon will be transcribed and translated, so that tryptophan can be produced. Thus, domain 4 is an attenuator. Without domain 4, translation can continue regardless of the level of tryptophan. The attenuator sequence has its codons translated into a leader peptide, but {{is not part of the}} trp operon gene sequence. The attenuator allows more time for the attenuator sequence domains to form loop structures, but does not produce a protein that is used in later tryptophan synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Attenuation is a {{regulatory}} feature found throughout Archaea and Bacteria causing premature <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> Attenuators are 5'-cis acting regulatory regions which fold {{into one of}} two alternative RNA structures which determine the success of transcription. The folding is modulated by a sensing mechanism producing either a Rho-independent terminator, resulting in interrupted transcription and a non-functional RNA product; or an anti-terminator structure, resulting in a functional RNA transcript. There are now many equivalent examples where the translation, not transcription, is terminated by sequestering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosomal binding site) in a hairpin-loop structure. While not meeting the previous definition of (transcriptional) attenuation, these are now considered to be variants of the same phenomena and are included in this article. Attenuation is an ancient regulatory system, prevalent in many bacterial species providing fast and sensitive regulation of gene operons and is commonly used to repress genes {{in the presence of}} their own product (or a downstream metabolite).|$|E

Using an RNAi screening approach, we identified chaperonin containing TCP 1 subunit g (CCTg) as a regulator of Drosophila NF-kB proteins, Dorsal and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif). CCTg was also found to regulate NF-kB-driven transcription in mammalian cells, acting in a promoter-specific context, downstream of IkB kinase (IKK). CCTg knockdown repressed IkBa and CXCL 2 /MIP 2 transcription during the early phase of NF-kB activation while impairing the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> CCL 5 /RANTES and CXCL 10 /IP 10 transcription. The latter effect was associated with increased DNA binding and reduced p 65 acetylation, presumably by altering the activity of histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP).

40|$|My Ph. D. {{dissertation}} work {{is focused}} on studying the role of promoter-bound transcription initiation factors involved in gene looping. In this study we showed that the RNAP II subunit Rpb 4 has {{a significant effect on}} <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> Gene looping is disrupted in the absence of Rpb 4. Rpb 4 shows a strong physical interaction with the Mediator subunit Srb 5. Mediator subunit Srb 5 crosslinked to the 52 ̆ 7 and 32 ̆ 7 ends of INO 1 and CHA 1 genes and is required for proper <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> of these genes. Srb 5 affected <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> through its interaction with the CF 1 complex. Srb 5 interaction with the CF 1 complex as well as its crosslinking to the 3 ′ end of the genes is dependent on gene looping.

These results strongly indicate a role for gene looping in Srb 5 -mediated <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> More importantly, this study has identified a yet another biological role for gene looping in transcription. The prevalence of gene looping was analyzed by genomewide TFIIB ChIP-Seq. The simultaneous presence of TFIIB on both the promoter and terminator of a gene was taken as a measure of gene looping.

40|$|In budding yeast, as {{in higher}} eukaryotes, {{transcription}} of protein coding genes is executed by a highly specialized, conserved polymerase called RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The transcription cycle of RNAPII has four major steps: initiation, elongation, termination, and reinitiation. The successful accomplishment {{of each of}} these steps requires a number of accessory factors. Many of these factors operate at multiple steps in the transcription cycle. The major focus {{of this study was to}} examine the function of Clp 1, which is an RNA processing factor operating at the 3 ′ end of genes, in the transcription cycle. Clp 1 is one of the four subunits of the CFIA 3 ′ end processing complex. It is the least investigated CFIA subunit. The role of the other three subunits of the CFIA complex in 32 ̆ 7 end processing and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> is well documented. Here we investigate the role of Clp 1 in the initiation as well as the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> We used a temperature-sensitive mutant of Clp 1 to assess its function. We demonstrated a direct role for this factor in the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> of CHA 1. We used three different approaches; TRO assay, RNAPII-ChIP assay, and strand specific RT-PCR, to demonstrate the termination function of Clp 1. In addition, we showed that Clp 1 is also involved in the early steps of the transcription. Our results strongly suggest that Clp 1 participates in promoter-associated transcription. We provide multiple lines of evidence in support of a role for Clp 1 at the 5 ′ end of genes. First, the presence of Clp 1 in the vicinity of the promoter region implies its involvement early in the transcription cycle. Second, the decrease in RNAPII density near the promoter without a parallel decrease in the level of the GTFs suggested a role for Clp 1 in reinitiation of transcription. Third, an increase in 52 ̆ 7 initiated antisense divergent transcripts in the Clp 1 mutant supports a role for the factor in providing directionality to the promoter-bound polymerase. To assess the generality of the observed functions of Clp 1, we investigated the role of Clp 1 in the transcription cycle on a genomewide scale using GRO-Seq approach. Our results show that the number of transcriptionally active genes decreased by at least two-fold in the clp 1 mutant. The GRO-Seq results strongly suggest a genomewide function for Clp 1 in the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription,</b> and indicate that Clp 1 is required for the pausing of RNAPII that is a pre-requisite for the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription.</b> We also observed a dramatic increase in 32 ̆ 7 initiated antisense transcription in the absence of a functional Clp 1 protein. Using the chromosome conformation capture approach, CCC, we observed a role for Clp 1 in gene loop formation. We found a strong correlation between the Clp 1 function in gene looping, and its role in promoter-associated transcription which implies gene looping as the means through which this factor is exerting its functions at the 5 ′ end of genes...|$|E
