25|$|Although she was {{deprived}} of her lover, {{the end of}} the war saw an improvement in Rudge's fortunes as her sequestered Venetian home was returned to her. In order to avoid a trial for treason, Pound was declared criminally insane and incarcerated in an asylum, St. Elizabeths Hospital, where he remained for twelve years. Rudge began the onerous task of trying to secure his freedom. She used friends and their many contacts in the literary world to mount a petition attesting to his character and that amongst other <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never in fact been a member of the Italian Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista). One of her ideas was that Pound be released to live in an American monastery, but all her entreaties fell on deaf ears. His letters discourage Rudge from visiting him but she did travel to America to visit him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955. Pound at this time was receiving visits not only from his wife but other mistresses too. Following the 1955 visit, their letters to each other became cooler and more impersonal, and they rarely communicated at all from 1955 to 1959.|$|E

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that an MP retains his or her Parliamentary seat despite being under some {{disqualification}} until Parliament has made a formal decision on the matter. On 10 November 1986, the MP for Anson, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore, lost an appeal against a conviction for making a false statement in a declaration and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and a fine of $5,000. Further applications and appeals in the criminal proceedings to the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Privy Council (then Singapore's highest court) were dismissed. On 9 December, the Speaker of Parliament made a statement in the House that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP with effect from 10 November by virtue of having been convicted of an offence and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000. Jeyaretnam did not object to the statement at the time. Under Article 45(2) of the Constitution, he was disqualified to be an MP until five years had elapsed from the date the fine was imposed. Jeyaretnam subsequently applied to court for a declaration that, among other <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not ceased to be an MP in 1986 and that the Speaker's statement had been ineffective because Parliament itself had not determined that he had vacated his seat. On 9 July 1990, the High Court ruled that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP by operation of law and that no separate determination by Parliament had been necessary.|$|E

Peligro, who helped co-write [...] "Stone Cold Bush", [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] and [...] "Sexy Mexican Maid" [...] for the Mother's Milk album, was fired in late November 1988.

500|$|The soundtrack to Departures was by Joe Hisaishi, a {{composer}} who had gained international recognition {{for his work}} with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, {{as well as the}} mortician's love for his wife. Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack; he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello {{as one of the most}} difficult <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever done. This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita [...] "allowed [...] to visualize many of the emotions in the film" [...] and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work.|$|E
500|$|The next schedule, {{which began}} on 18 June, filmed in London and Belfast for 60 days. At the Causeway Pictures studio in Northern Ireland, 1:Nenokkadine {{was the first}} Telugu film shot in Belfast. Hollywood stunt co-ordinator Conrad Palmisano {{supervised}} stunts by Mahesh and others. Rathnavelu called the action scene in a London car park [...] "one of the most satisfying" [...] <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever done. The scene takes place during a power failure, with the headlights of motorcycles chasing the protagonist the only sources of light. To film the scene, Rathnavelu used LED lamps and three torchlights; smoke was pumped into the air to create a backdrop. When scenes were filmed on one of London's three main bridges, traffic was stopped {{on both sides of}} the bridge for more than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|McCay came to {{be known}} by his middle name, Winsor. His drawing skills emerged early. [...] According to a story told within the family, McCay made his first drawing in the {{aftermath}} of one of the many fires that hit Spring Lake: he picked up a nail and etched the scene of the fire in the frost of a windowpane. [...] Drawing became obsessive for him; he drew anything he saw, and the level of detail and accuracy in his drawing was noted at a young age. [...] He was able to draw accurately from memory even <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never before drawn—what McCay called [...] "memory sketching". [...] His father thought little of his son's artistic talents, though, and had him sent to Cleary Business College in Ypsilanti, Michigan. [...] McCay rarely attended classes. [...] He bragged about how he would catch the train to Detroit to show off his drawing skills at the Wonderland and Eden Musee dime museum. [...] He drew portraits there for 25 apiece, of which he kept half.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{knew that}} for the story they wanted to [...] "throw the player right in the action, with <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to do without explanation" [...] in addition to creating {{a sense of urgency}} and mystery for the player. They developed an initial draft of the game's plot and gave it to script writer Sachie Hirano and scenario event planner Yukari Ishida to expand on. The returned version was very close to the initial vision for the game's story. However, there were still difficulties in filling out the story, only achieving some smooth development about halfway through the process, and even then, there were still changes made just prior to creating the master image for the game. Several inconsistencies with the game's story were found in the final quality checks that had to be resolved. The Square Enix localization team, while translating most of the dialog and interface items into English and other European languages, preserved many Japanese elements to avoid losing the culture of the game. The team was also limited {{by the size of the}} dialog balloons used within game, and took several steps to avoid losing the meaning of the story within the game.|$|E
500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, {{as long as they have}} entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|Ballantyne {{never visited}} the coral {{islands of the}} South Pacific, relying instead on the {{accounts}} of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including [...] "plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in {{a house on the}} Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams' book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as [...] "a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific", adding that [...] "by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling".|$|E

500|$|Unlike Carey's debut album, which {{featured}} a more contemporary pop and R background, Emotions {{proved to be}} far different. It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, R, soul, pop and 1960s and 1970s influences. The album's lead single [...] "Emotions" [...] borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. The song's lyrics were described as [...] "joyful" [...] by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover. One of the album's more gospel infused songs, [...] "And You Don't Remember," [...] featured organ chord changes and held minimal production {{in order to give}} the vocals a more [...] "raw and sixties feel." [...] It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads, with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals, and sole musical arrangement by Carey. Its lyrics reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him [...] "Don't You Remember" [...] all those <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> promised her, and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together. [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content. The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from fifties balladry. For the duration {{of the first half of}} the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish. Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on [...] "Make It Happen," [...] which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia. It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "very Motownish," [...] as well as noting its soft gospel infusion. Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres. According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation: ...|$|E
