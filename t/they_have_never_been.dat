Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{have made}} 18 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and 27 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. As the Cardinals have signed all of their first-round picks, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> awarded a supplementary pick under this provision.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate.

The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United Football Club is an English {{professional}} football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester. The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, {{before joining the}} Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not {{been out of the}} top tier since 1975, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> lower than the second tier. They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1890 as Tow Law F.C., before adding the Town to their name in 1905, and {{throughout}} their history they have played {{in a number of}} local leagues including the Auckland and District League, the South Durham Alliance and the Crook and District League, before joining the Northern League in 1920. They have won the Northern League's Division Two twice—in 1988 and 1992—and its Division One on three occasions—in 1924, 1925 and 1995—but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> promoted or demoted from the Northern League since joining it more than 90 years ago.

However, the main threat to their populations is from habitat destruction through land clearing and agricultural development.

Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, {{a fire in}} the Panagia Episkopi {{destroyed}} the major part of the books, church documents and priestly robes. The icons of the church, however, survived without damage. The 1956 Amorgos earthquake, which destroyed large parts of the Mesa Gonias, caused severe damage to the church buildings. Subsequently, the inhabitants of Mesa Gonia founded the coastal town of Kamari beneath the traditional town. The reconstruction and fundamental restoration of the church continued until 1986. During the work in 1982, all 26 portable icons were stolen, among which were three framed frescoes, which were separated from the walls. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> discovered since.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{has some}} of the strictest {{abortion}} laws in the world. One of the last acts of the military government under Pinochet was to outlaw abortion in all circumstances. Chile's abortion law criminalizes abortion even when it would save a pregnant woman's life. Therapeutic abortion was legal between 1931 and 1989 but is now is illegal under all circumstances. There have been proposed bills from Chilean legislators and s on abortion and reproductive rights, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> passed. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 for the number of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year. Chile is considered to have one of the highest abortion rates in Latin America. Every year, nearly 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant. Emergency contraception was banned in 2008, making the distribution of emergency contraception illegal under all circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Neither the DSM nor the ICD-10 {{diagnostic}} criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis {{can therefore be}} made based {{on the presence of}} fantasies or sexual urges even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include indecent exposure, voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, or masturbating to child pornography. Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the people}} in these {{countries}} have become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
