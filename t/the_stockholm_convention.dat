5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Convention,</b> which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

25|$|In general, a {{pesticide}} is {{a chemical}} or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests.

25|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environment and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use {{was a threat to}} wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Convention</b> on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease vector control continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.|$|E

25|$|Although {{classified}} as a yellow label (highly toxic) pesticide by the Central Insecticides Board, India {{is one of the}} largest producers and the largest consumer of endosulfan in the world. Of the total volume manufactured in India, three companies — Excel Crop Care, Hindustan Insecticides Ltd, and Coromandal Fertilizers — produce 4,500 tonnes annually for domestic use and another 4,000 tonnes for export. Endosulfan is widely used in most of the plantation crops in India. The toxicity of endosulfan and health issues due to its bioaccumulation came under media attention when health issues precipitated in the Kasargod District (of Kerala) were publicised. This inspired protests, and the pesticide was banned in Kerala as early as 2001, following a report by the National Institute of Occupational Health. In <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Convention</b> on Persistent Organic Pollutants of 2011, when an international consensus arose for the global ban of the pesticide, India opposed this move due to pressure from the endosulfan manufacturing companies. This flared up the protest, and while India still maintained its stance, the global conference decided on a global ban, for which India asked a remission for 10 years.

Suitable sample matrix is needed to measure the temporal and spatial distribution of the priority POPs, which are both intentional and unintentionally released to the environment. Passive sample techniques have been applied to the GMP monitoring activities to assess the global long range transport of POPs. The data produced by passive samplers have been shown to correspond to the more advanced active air sampler. The advantage with passive air sampling is that no advanced equipment demanding electricity is needed. The samplers can therefore be set up everywhere, even at remote areas. But still some education of the personnel is needed to operate the sampler. Aspects such as wind direction, temperature and sampling time are crucial to register and incorporate into the calculations. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility to use another passive sample approach for screening purposes, i. e. animal lipids such as butter. The advantages to use butter as biomonitoring matrix are several; due to the lipophilic and persistent properties of POPs they are bioaccumulated in lipid rich matrix; butter reflects the contamination level of the environmental compartment from which they derive due to well known transfer factors; butter is available in almost all geographic regions and is cheap and easily accessible; moreover, this biomonitor is well buffered against temporal variations. The air-grass-cow transfer factors are available from controlled experiments. Hence it remains to verify the correlation in the field in order to assess ambient air quality. The POP levels of 160 samples from Europe have been analyzed and will be evaluated together with available air data to establish a correlation between air contamination and dairy products (assuming minimal commercial feed contamination influence).
