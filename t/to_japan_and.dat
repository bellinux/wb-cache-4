5|$|Laurens Hammond died in 1973, and {{the company}} {{struggled}} to survive, proposing an acquiring of Roland in 1972, which was turned down. Roland's Ikutaro Kakehashi did not believe it was practical at that point to move the entire manufacturing operation from Chicago <b>to</b> <b>Japan,</b> <b>and</b> also viewed Hammond's declining sales figures as a problem.|$|E
5|$|The 102d Intelligence Wing traces {{its roots}} to the 318th Fighter Group which {{was formed in}} 1942.

The 318th returned to the United States after the war, was inactivated on 12 January 1946.|$|E

The film failed to meet or exceed the critical success of its predecessor, but was still a box office success.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back <b>to</b> <b>Japan,</b> <b>and</b> male Japanese settlers who {{had raised}} Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, Augsburg was deployed to the Baltic, while Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln remained in the North Sea. The three ships were assigned to patrol duty in the Heligoland Bight; on 28 August 1914, they were attacked during the Battle of Heligoland Bight. Mainz and Cöln were both sunk in the battle. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, and joined Augsburg for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. Both ships also saw service during Operation Albion in October 1917. Both ships survived the war; Kolberg was ceded to France, where she was renamed Colmar and served in the French Navy until 1927. Augsburg was surrendered <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> was then sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of {{at least some of}} the maps, notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers. The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.|$|E

The following year, Domínguez {{was included in the}} Spain squad for the 2012 Olympics alongside Atlético Madrid teammates Adrián López and Koke. Spain were eliminated early on however, after defeats <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> Honduras saw them knocked out of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E
5|$|During the war, 10 {{soldiers}} of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. They were William F. Dean, George D. Libby, Melvin O. Handrich, Mitchell Red Cloud, Jr., Carl H. Dodd, Nelson V. Brittin, Ray E. Duke, Stanley T. Adams, Mack A. Jordan, and Woodrow W. Keeble. Keeble's medal was awarded on 3 March 2008, 26 years after his death. The 24th Infantry Division suffered 3,735 killed and 7,395 wounded during the Korean War. It remained on front-line duty after the armistice until October 1957, patrolling the 38th parallel {{in the event that}} combat would resume.

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker {{said he could not}} hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it would hold.|$|E

5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors holds a {{score of}} 82/100 at the review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. It was a commercial failure in Japan, with 27,762 copies sold in 2009 and an additional 11,891 in 2010, reaching a total of 39,653 copies sold. Meanwhile, American sales were described as being strong; according to Uchikoshi, this was a surprise, as the visual novel genre was seen as being particular <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> unlikely to be accepted overseas.|$|E
