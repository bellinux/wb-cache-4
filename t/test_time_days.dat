However, studies are still lacking to define the optimal cutoff point, especially in ED patients [1]. This previous meta-analysis pointed out the heterogeneity of the results observed in the studies. In the specific field of ED patients, there are few studies that report association of PCT level with mortality [15 – 17].

Thus, relationship between PCT and prognosis required further study.|$|R

Accurate and rapid detection of carbapenamase producers has {{a great impact on}} patient improvement and aids in implementation of infection control measures. Aim: In this study, we describe the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) to identify carbapenamase-producing A. baumannii isolates in up to 3 h. Isolates and Methods: A total of 50 A. baumannii isolates (of which 39 were carabapenamase producers) were tested using MALDI TOF MS. Isolates were incubated for 3 h with 0. 25 mg/ml up to 2 mg/ml of imipenem (IMP) at 37 °C. Supernatants were analysed by MALDI TOF to analyse peaks corresponding to IMP (300 Da) and an IMP metabolite (254 Da) using UltrafleXtreme (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Results: All carbapenamase-producing isolates were evidenced by the disappearance or reduction in intensity of the 300 Da peak of IPM and the appearance of a 254 Da peak of the IPM metabolite. In isolates that did not produce carbapenamase, the IPM 300 Da peak remained intact.

40|$|Abstract—Automated GUI testing {{consists}} of simulating user events and validating {{the changes in}} the GUI in order to determine if an Android application meets specifications. Traditional record-replay testing tools mainly focus on facilitating the test case writing process but not the replay and verification process. The accuracy of testing tools degrades significantly when the device under test (DUT) is under heavy load. In order to improve the accuracy, our previous work, SPAG, uses event batching and smart wait function to eliminate the uncertainty of the replay process and adopts GUI layout information to verify the testing results. SPAGmaintains an accuracy of up to 99. 5 percent and outperforms existing methods. In this work, we propose smart phone automated GUI testing tool with camera (SPAG-C), an extension of SPAG, to test an Android hardware device. Our goal is to further reduce the time required to record test cases and increase reusability of the test oracle without compromising test accuracy. In the record stage, SPAG captures screenshots from device’s frame buffer and writes verification commands into the test case. Unlike SPAG, SPAG-C captures the screenshots from an external camera instead of frame buffer. In the replay stage, SPAG-C automatically performs image comparison while SPAG simply performs a string comparison to verify the test results. In order to make SPAG-C reusable for different devices and to allow better synchronization at the time of capturing images, we develop a new architecture that uses an external camera and Web services to decouple the test oracle. Our experiments show that recording a test case using SPAG-C’s automatic verification is as fast as SPAG’s but more accurate. Moreover, SPAG-C is 50 to 75 percent faster than SPAG in achieving the same test accuracy. With reusability, SPAG-C reduces the <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> from <b>days</b> to hours for heterogeneous devices.

Although very often used, the total germination percentage after a nominated period of time is not very informative as it lacks information about start, rate, and uniformity of germination, which are highly indicative of such traits as dormancy, stress tolerance, and seed longevity.

We asked, therefore, whether rats remember the <b>time</b> of <b>day</b> at which they encountered a distinctive event, in addition to what occurred and where it happened. Rats were tested {{in the morning and}} afternoon, on separate days. A distinctive flavor (chocolate) was replenished at a daily-unique location at only one of these times.

The potential alkali reactivity of aggregates is often tested using the ASTM C 1260 method. This research used the modified ASTM C 1260 to test the potential alkali reactivity of aggregates. The modification included replacing the standard 1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used in ASTM C 1260 with eutectic concentrations of the three common chloridebased deicing chemicals: sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium chloride (MgCl 2), and calcium chloride (CaCl 2). The {{results showed that the}} mortar bars with reactive aggregate (Jobe sand) stored in NaCl solution developed higher expansion than those stored in MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 solutions. It seems NaCl can initiate (or accelerate) the alkali silica reaction (ASR), while MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 do not seem to contribute to ASR. In addition, after about 100 – 120 days of exposure, irrespective of whether they contained reactive (Jobe sand) or nonreactive (Ottawa sand) aggregates, the mortar bars submerged in the MgCl 2 solution started to crack and disintegrate. This implies that the observed expansions should be attributed solely to the effect of these deicers on the cement paste itself rather than to their effects on aggregates.

However, none of these studies demonstrated causality. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to APAP during pregnancy result in hyperkinetic dysfunctions in offspring, using a murine model. Pregnant CD 1 mice (N = 8 /group) were allocated to receive by gavage either APAP (150 mg/kg/day, equivalent to the FDA-approved maximum human clinical dose), or 0. 5 % carboxymethylcellulose (control group), starting on embryonic day 7 until delivery. Maternal serum APAP and alanine transaminase (ALT) concentrations were determined by ELISA and kinetic colorimetric assays, respectively. Open field locomotor activity (LMA) in the 30 -day old mouse offspring was quantified using Photobeam Activity System. Mouse offspring were then sacrificed, whole brains processed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 11. 7 Tesla magnet) and for neuronal quantification using Nissl stain. The association between APAP exposure and LMA in mouse offspring was analyzed using a mixed effects Poisson regression model that accounted for mouse offspring weight, gender, random selection, and <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> and <b>day.</b> We corrected for multiple comparisons and considered P< 0. 008 as statistically significant.

In addition, no differences were found in volumes of 29 brain areas of interest on MRI or in neuronal quantifications between the two groups. This study refutes that hypothesis that prenatal exposure to APAP causes hyperkinetic dysfunction in mouse offspring.

A previously proposed technique that reuses network-on-chip for test purposes is used to define the optimum number of BISTed cores in the system, considering <b>test</b> <b>time</b> minimization and power consumption requirements.

40|$|Abstract—Conventionally, testing uses clock with fixed {{period during}} scan shift, which make the tests long. In this work, we propose two methods, scaling supply voltage and scaling frequency, that {{significantly}} reduce <b>test</b> <b>time</b> without increasing the power budget. The proposed methodologies were verified by simulation and through experiments. The experiments were {{carried on the}} Advantest T 2000 ATE. The simulations were performed using ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits and results show up to 70 % reduction in <b>test</b> <b>time.</b> I. POWER CONSTRAINED <b>TEST</b> <b>TIME</b> Theorem.
