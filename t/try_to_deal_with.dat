The Italian {{government}} of Massimo D'Alema was not yet {{able to take a}} clear stance on whether to satisfy the extradition request. Italian government tried to negotiate a deal with other EU states and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Interpol's arrest demand. Finally, Öcalan was allowed to leave the country, without revealing his destination, thereby releasing the Italian government from an embarrassing situation. He was apparently sent to Saint Petersburg, Russia, then Athens, Greece. The Greek government moved him to Korfu for a while, then to the Greek Embassy in Kenya.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{long period}} of {{dramatic}} and serious feature films, Almodóvar's next film was a comedy. [...] I'm So Excited (2013) is set almost entirely on an aircraft in flight, whose first-class passengers, pilots, and trio of gay stewards all <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the fact that landing gears are malfunctioning. During the ordeal, they talk about love, themselves, and a plethora of things while getting drunk on Valencia cocktails.

2500|$|The show {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car accident.

In this episode Britten investigates {{the death of a}} homeless man, Bernard Mackenzie. Meanwhile, Hannah and Rex <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> each other's death in their respective realities, while Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) is increasingly concerned about Britten's behavior.

2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that {{you have a chance to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't try to figure out what the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E

60|$|One of the {{functions}} of the last section will be to act as a kind of intelligence bureau, watching the continual changes of the labour market here and abroad, and suggesting any measure which may be practicable, such as co-ordination and distribution of Government contracts and municipal work, so as to act as a counterpoise to the movement of the ordinary labour market, and it will also, we trust, be able to conduct examinations of schemes of public utility, so that such schemes can, if decided upon by the Government and the Treasury, be set on foot at any time with knowledge and forethought, instead of the haphazard, hand-to-mouth manner with which we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> these emergencies at the present time.|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} these years of labour under Peel that he first {{acquired}} principles of administrative and parliamentary practice that afterwards stood him in good stead: on no account to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> a question before it is ripe; never to go the length of submitting a difference between two departments {{to the prime minister}} before the case is exhausted and complete; never to press a proposal forward beyond the particular stage at which it has arrived. Pure commonplaces if we will, but they are not all of them easy to learn. We cannot forget that Peel and Mr. Gladstone were in the strict line of political succession. They were alike in social origin and academic antecedents. They started from the same point of view as to the great organs of national life, the monarchy, the territorial peerage and the commons, the church, the universities. They showed the same clear knowledge that it was not by its decorative parts, or what Burke styled 'solemn plausibilities,' that the community derived its strength; but that it rested for its real foundations on its manufactures, its commerce, and its credit. Even in the lesser things, in reading Sir Robert Peel's letters, those who in later years served under Mr. Gladstone can recognise the school to which he went for the methods, the habits of mind, the practices of business, and even the phrases which he employed when his own time came to assume the direction of public affairs, the surmounting of administrative difficulties, the piloting of complex measures, and the handling of troublesome persons.|$|E
60|$|Our {{schoolmaster}} gone, we {{were once}} more {{back in the}} old way; we did just what we liked. Our parents probably thought that our life would be on the plains, with sheep and cattle-breeding for only vocations, and that should any one of us, like my mathematical-minded brother, take some line of his own, he would find out the way of it for himself: his own sense, the light of nature, would be his guide. I had no inclination to do anything with books myself: books were lessons, therefore repellent, and that any one should read a book for pleasure was inconceivable. The only attempt to improve our minds at this period came, oddly enough, from my masterful brother who despised our babyish intellects--especially mine. However, one day he announced that he had a grand scheme to put before us. He had heard or read of a family of boys living just like us in some wild isolated land where there were no schools or teachers and no newspapers, who amused themselves by writing a journal of their own, which was issued once a week. There was a blue pitcher on a shelf in the house, and into this pitcher every boy dropped his contribution, and one of them--of course the most intelligent one--carefully went through them, selected the best, and copied them all out in one large sheet, and this was their weekly journal called The Blue Pitcher, and it was read and enjoyed by the whole house. He proposed that we should do the same; he, of course, would edit the paper and write a large portion of it; it would occupy two or four sheets of quarto paper, all in his beautiful handwriting, which resembled copper-plate, and it would be issued {{for all of us to}} read every Saturday. We all agreed joyfully, and as the title had taken our fancy we started hunting for a blue pitcher all over the house, but couldn't find such a thing, and finally had to put up with a tin box with a wooden lid and a lock and key. The contributions were to be dropped in through a slit in the lid which the carpenter made for us, and my brother took possession of the key. The title of the paper was to be The Tin Box, and we were instructed to write about the happenings of the week and anything in fact which had interested us, and not to be such little asses as to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> subjects we knew nothing about. I was to say something about birds: there was never a week went by in which I didn't tell them a wonderful story of a strange bird I had seen for the first time: well, I could write about that strange bird and make it just as wonderful as I liked.|$|E
