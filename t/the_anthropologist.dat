5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and {{kept in touch with}} <b>the</b> <b>anthropologist</b> Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug if he wanted to come to Hawaii with him.|$|E
5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by <b>the</b> <b>anthropologist</b> Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E

5|$|On 25 March 1669, Pivljanin, {{living in}} Stoliv (near Kotor), was {{recorded}} in Kotor as having acknowledged a debt of 62.5 real (40 groschen being 1 real) to Gierolamo Cazalieri. In early April 1669 Pivljanin and Puhalović raised and looted in Herzegovina, and retreated towards Šipan. According to legend, he burnt down a mosque in Nevesinje, and another one in Počitelj. There are accounts recorded by <b>the</b> <b>anthropologist</b> Jevto Dedijer that several Muslim families left their homes after cruel treatment by Pivljanin; the Šehović left Korjenići and moved to south Herzegovina after he and Limun burnt down their house; the Kajtaz and Rorić left Nevesinje and moved to Mostar, {{and a large number}} of the families of Slivlja left their homes. The war ended with Ottoman victory in 1669, with Venice being forced to relinquish all of the territory taken over by the uskoks and hajduks during the war, with only Klis becoming a new Venetian possession. The Venetian–Ottoman border delineation act was signed on 30 October 1671.|$|E
5|$|Various human {{cultures}} have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. <b>The</b> <b>anthropologist,</b> A. Asbjørn Jøn, has analysed {{beliefs of the}} Celts of Orkney and Hebrides who believed in selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance {{in the culture of}} the Inuit. In Inuit mythology, the goddess Sedna rules over the sea and marine animals. She is depicted as a mermaid, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest Ancient Greek coins depicts the head of a seal, and the animals were mentioned by Homer and Aristotle. The Greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods Poseidon and Apollo. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern popular culture, pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos, circuses and marine mammal parks.|$|E
5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and <b>the</b> <b>anthropologist</b> Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into an airtight container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E

50|$|A further key {{critique}} of cultural evolutionism {{is what is}} known as “armchair anthropology.” The name results from {{the fact that many of}} <b>the</b> <b>anthropologists</b> advancing theories had not seen first hand the cultures they were studying. The research and data collected was carried out by explorers and missionaries as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>anthropologists</b> themselves. Edward Tylor was the epitome of this, who did very little of his own research.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Anthropologist's</b> Video {{notebook}} is a video database {{application that}} allows researchers to present movies in a format {{that reflects the}} contextual complexity of ethnographic data. <b>The</b> <b>Anthropologist's</b> Video Notebook is grounded in both the practice of ethnographic research and motion picture production. The lexical descriptions of video content are represented using the Stratification system. Stratification is a context-based layered annotation method which treats descriptions of video as objects. Stratification supports the complementary and at times contradictory descriptions which result when different researchers use video source material which is available on a random access video work-station. The development of <b>the</b> <b>Anthropologist's</b> video notebook {{is based on a}} real field work experience in the state of Chiapas Mexico. The integration of ethnographic research methods and video production heralds a new research methodology called video ethnography.

50|$|Since any {{cultures}} {{that have been}} studied by anthropologists have had contact with at least <b>the</b> <b>anthropologists</b> that studied it, and anthropological research ethics slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before <b>the</b> <b>anthropologists</b> do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied. This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.

25|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>anthropologist</b> Tim Ingold, animism shares {{similarities}} to totemism but differs in {{its focus on}} individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds {{that there is a}} primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the Australian Aboriginals are more typically totemic, whereas others like the Inuit are more typically animistic in their worldview.|$|E
