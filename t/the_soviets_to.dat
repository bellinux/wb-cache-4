5|$|On August 6, 1981 President Reagan {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a neutron bomb. While contentious, this had the desired effect of bringing <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> the bargaining table, and negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe started on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Operation Kutuzov {{reduced the}} Orel salient and inflicted {{substantial}} losses on the German military, {{paving the way}} for the liberation of Smolensk. Soviet losses were heavy, but were replaced. The offensive allowed <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> seize the strategic initiative, which they retained {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{came under}} {{control of the}} Soviet Red Fleet in September 1917. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Gromoboi sailed to Kronstadt in {{what became known as}} the 'Ice Voyage' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival.|$|E

50|$|Losses in men of both army groups taken {{prisoner}} by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> amounted <b>to</b> some 860,000 men. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> claimed <b>to</b> have captured 9,500 guns and mortars, 1,800 armored vehicles, and 1,100 {{aircraft in the}} course of the operation.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Bure {{appeared}} in his third and final World Junior Championships. Bure finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 12 goals in 7 games and the Soviets won the silver medal. He finished his three-year World Junior career with a tournament-record 27 goals, to go with 39 points, in 21 games. Bure later competed in the 1991 World Championships, his second international appearance of the year. He improved on his previous year's total with 11 points in 11 games, tied for the team lead with Valeri Kamensky, and helped <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> a bronze medal finish. Bure {{was named to the}} tournament's Second All-Star Team. The 1991 team marked the last World Championships for the USSR, as the country was dissolved later that year.|$|E
5|$|The August 1938 {{shipbuilding}} plan {{envisioned a}} total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> reassess their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority {{should be given to}} only one of the three remaining battleships.|$|E
5|$|The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 slowed her reconstruction, and {{the ship}} was not {{completed}} until 1908. She spent most of World War I as a training ship, although she became a depot ship for submarines in 1917. Petr Veliky was in Helsinki in March 1918 when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> evacuate their naval base at Helsinki or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. The ship reached Kronstadt in April 1918 and was hulked on 21 May 1921. She remained in service with the Soviets, in various secondary roles, until she was finally stricken from the Navy List in 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet coaches {{blamed the}} loss on the refereeing. Bobrov {{complained that the}} pair of American referees, Frank Larsen and Steve Dowling, let the Canadians get away with everything. After the game, {{the head of the}} USSR Hockey Federation, Andrei Starovoitov, charged the door of the officials' {{dressing}} room and kicked chairs over. The pair of referees, scheduled to referee game four in Vancouver, were replaced by the pair who had refereed game one and game three, Gord Lee and Len Gagnon. Team Canada agreed to the request by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> change referees, apparently not aware of Starovoitov's tantrum after game two.|$|E

Admiral Makarov {{was among the first}} group of ships that sailed on 25 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. She was paid off upon arrival and did not participate in the Russian Civil War. The ship was sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up in Stettin.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies were}} then doused with petrol, {{but they were}} only {{partially}} burned and not buried. A few days later, Voss was {{brought back to the}} bunker by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.|$|E

5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{competed in}} his second World Juniors in 1990, winning a silver medal in Helsinki, Finland, and scoring seven goals in seven games. Later that year, he made his senior debut with the Soviet {{national}} team as a 19-year-old at the 1990 World Championships in Switzerland. He scored two goals and four assists in ten games to help <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> a gold medal finish. The Soviet team also won silver in the European Championship, which was decided from games played among the European teams at the tournament. Several months later, in July, Bure took part in his third international tournament {{of the year at}} the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle. Bure scored four goals and an assist in five games, and the Soviets won the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} restrictions, Shazly {{supported}} a limited war to retake only {{the east bank}} of the canal, as opposed to Sadek. However, Sadek authorized the planning of two offensive plans, starting in July 1971. The first was Operation 41, which involved an offensive along the entire Suez Canal {{with the objective of}} seizing the key passes of the Sinai. The plan was developed in cooperation with Soviet advisers. As it was, the objectives of the operation were outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military and Shazly saw it only as a means of inducing <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> supply more arms and equipment. The plan would also encourage the Syrians to join in an attack against Israel. Operation 41 was completed by September 1971, and the following month, Sadat and Sadek flew to Moscow to conclude Egypt's largest arms deal yet, receiving 100 MiG-21 fighters, 10 Tu-16 bombers, SA-6 anti-aircraft (AA) missiles and heavy artillery. Operation 41 was renamed Granite Two.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and started to fan out into the {{surrounding}} streets and buildings. The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support. At 04:00 hours, in the Führerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun. At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from the building. To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.|$|E
5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1948 Coastal Command {{was also}} {{involved}} in the Berlin Airlift. The Soviet Union attempted to cut off all aid to the city which was jointly occupied by the four major powers, the Soviets in the east, and the Americans, French and British in the west. The joint American-British operation continued for almost a year. Coastal Command aircraft were involved as flying boats were the only aircraft with internal anti-corrosion treatment allowing bulk salt to be transported. The Command's operations grew in intensity. By 13 July daily sorties had risen to 16. By October it was 214 sorties (other RAF Commands were also flying in supplies). The flying boats made their flight in using the Elbe river, but these operations {{came to a close}} on 14 December 1948, when the hazard from uncharted sandbanks and wreckage which, in some cases had been deliberately placed there by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Western Allies from supplying the city, made operations impractical. Over 1,000 sorties had been made, and 4,500 tons of supplies were flown in and 1,113 people, mainly children, evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Rossias crew took {{an active}} part in the revolutionary {{movements}} in 1917 and came under control of the Soviet Red Fleet in September 1917. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Rossia sailed to Kronstadt in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival. She was sold to a German company for scrapping on 1 July 1922. While being towed to Germany in the Baltic Sea, she broke free from her tow and ran aground on the Dyvelseye Shoal on the coast of Estonia on 16 October 1922. But was subsequently refloated, towed to Kiel, and broken up.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E
5|$|After her {{completion}} Petr Veliky {{was assigned}} to the Gunnery Training Detachment through 1917. A number of sources report that she was renamed by the Soviets as Respublikanets (Republican) or Barrikada (Barricade), but this is not confirmed by the post-Cold War sources used by McLaughlin. That year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at Kronstadt and later Helsinki. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>to</b> evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Petr Veliky reached Kronstadt in April in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. The ship was hulked on 21 May 1921 and used to store mines. She was renamed Blokshiv Nr. 1 on 4 December 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in September 1923. She was not refloated and repaired until 5 October 1927. On 1 January 1932 she was renamed to Blokshiv Nr. 4, and to BSh-3 on 16 May 1949, by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at Kronstadt. The ship was stricken on 18 April 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
