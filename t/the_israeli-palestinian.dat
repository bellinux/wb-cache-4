5|$|For its {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding <b>the</b> <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E

5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} <b>the</b> <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As {{a result of}} the al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|In modern Syria, Zenobia is {{regarded}} as a hero; her image appeared on banknotes, and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series Al-Ababid (The Anarchy). The series was watched by millions in the Arabic-speaking world. It examined <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict from a Syrian perspective, where the queen's struggle symbolized the Palestinians' struggle to gain the right of self-determination. Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria's former minister of defense and one of the country's most prominent figures.|$|E

5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for <b>the</b> <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|Norman Gary Finkelstein (born December 8, 1953) is an American {{political}} scientist, activist, professor, and author. His primary {{fields of}} research are <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> {{conflict and the}} politics of the Holocaust, an interest motivated by the experiences of his parents who were Jewish Holocaust survivors. He is a graduate of Binghamton University and received his Ph.D in political science at Princeton University. He has held faculty positions at Brooklyn College, Rutgers University, Hunter College, New York University, and DePaul University where he was an assistant professor from 2001 to 2007.|$|E

5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> peace process.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

25|$|Relations between Israel and the European Union are {{generally}} positive {{on the economic}} level, though affected by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict on the political level.

25|$|Depending {{on various}} points of view, a one-state {{solution}} to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict {{is presented as}} a situation in which Israel would ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state and the Palestinians would fail to achieve their national independence within a two-state solution or, alternatively, as the best, most just, and only way to resolve <b>the</b> <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> conflict.|$|E
