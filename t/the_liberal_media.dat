5|$|During {{the course}} of his work on 20/20, Stossel {{discovered}} Reason magazine, and found that the libertarian ideas of its writers made sense to him. Stossel was named co-anchor of 20/20 in May 2003, while he was writing his first book, Gimme a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Media,</b> which was published in 2004. In it, he details his start in journalism and consumer reporting, and how he evolved to harbor libertarian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Media</b> is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

500|$|Antara {{received}} {{financial assistance}} {{from the government and}} was placed directly under the president's control, giving him the authority to appoint the agency's managing director and editor-in-chief. Antara's position in the structure of government resulted in confusion over its ownership and control, as well as shifting editorial views in the coming decades. As Sukarno pursued increasingly leftist policies, the conservative media accused Antara for its [...] "explicitly partisan" [...] reporting. Following his removal from office, the subsequent government also used the agency to further its policies, prompting criticism from <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E

500|$|On {{the subject}} of reviews, British critic Mark Lawson notes the {{tendency}} for Ellis' reviews to be [...] "unpredictable"; he cited the irony of favour amongst right-wing critics, {{and the extent to}} which <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> attack his work. Ellis himself, however, states that he [...] "proudly" [...] accepts the label of moralist. He also attributes some of the negative criticism that Imperial Bedrooms and Ellis' earlier works have received in the past to the earlier schools of feminist criticism; today, he observes young girls [...] "reading the works correctly", opining the books shouldn't be read through the lens of [...] "old school feminism." [...] To that end, the author observes that older women reviewing Imperial Bedrooms in the US had issues with it, not least feelings of betrayal. He feels these are ironic because the book is in fact a critique of a certain kind of male perspective and behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|The media {{established}} a sphere of public discourse surrounding the Hawk versus Dove debate. The Dove was a liberal and {{a critic of}} the war. Doves claimed that the war was well–intentioned but a disastrously wrong mistake in an otherwise benign foreign policy. It is important to note the Doves did not question the U.S. intentions in intervening in Vietnam, nor did they question the morality or legality of the U.S. intervention. Rather, they made pragmatic claims that the war was a mistake. Contrarily, the Hawks argued that the war was legitimate and winnable and a part of the benign U.S. foreign policy. The Hawks claimed that the one-sided criticism of the media contributed to the decline of public support for the war and ultimately helped the U.S. lose the war. Author William F. Buckley repeatedly wrote about his approval for the war and suggested that [...] "The United States has been timid, if not cowardly, in refusing to seek 'victory' in Vietnam." [...] The hawks claimed that <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> was responsible for the growing popular disenchantment with the war and blamed the western media for losing the war in Southeast Asia as communism was no longer a threat for them.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 during Rubio's senate campaign, {{and again}} in 2015 during his presidential campaign, issues were raised {{by the media and}} his {{political}} opponents about some items charged by Rubio to his Republican Party of Florida American Express card during his time as House speaker. Rubio charged about $110,000 during those two years, of which $16,000 was personal expenses unrelated to party business, such as groceries and plane tickets. Rubio said that he personally paid American Express more than $16,000 for these personal expenses. In 2012, the Florida Commission on Ethics cleared Rubio of wrongdoing in his use of the party-issued credit card, although the commission inspector said that Rubio exhibited a [...] "level of negligence" [...] in not using his personal MasterCard. In November 2015, Rubio released his party credit card statements for January 2005 through October 2006, which showed eight personal charges totaling $7,243.74, all of which he had personally reimbursed, in most instances by the next billing period. When releasing the charge records, Rubio spokesman Todd Harris said, [...] "These statements are more than 10 years old. And the only people who ask about them today are <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> and our political opponents. We are releasing them now because Marco has nothing to hide." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commentator Andrew Sullivan {{wrote an}} article in The New Republic accusing <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media</b> of {{political}} correctness and using Dirkhising's death to attack the Human Rights Campaign for its support of hate-crime legislation. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), however, complained that The Washington Times [...] "omitted a key piece of information" [...] for its front-page story on Dirkhising: The HRC had provided a statement strongly condemning the crime and called for the perpetrators to be punished [...] "to the fullest extent of the law." [...] Sullivan also criticized {{some aspects of the}} conservative coverage of the Dirkhising case equating gay sex with child molestation as [...] "ugly nonsense". Sullivan squarely summed up the differences in media coverage as being due to political interests. Sullivan stated that whereas the Shepherd case was used to support including LGBT people in federal hate-crime law the Dirkhising case was ignored for concerns of inciting anti-gay prejudice. In November 1999, E. R. Shipp, ombudsman at The Washington Post, noted that [...] "readers, prodded by commentators who are hostile to LGBT people and to what they view as a 'liberal' press" [...] had raised questions about the Dirkhising case. Shipp said, however, that she [...] "made a clear distinction" [...] between the Dirkhising and Shepard cases: [...] "Matthew Shepard's death sparked public expressions of outrage that themselves became news[...] [...] [...] That Jesse Dirkhising's death has not done so is hardly the fault of The Washington Post." [...] Shipp also noted that the Shepherd story was newsworthy because of the debate it fostered on hate crimes and the level of intolerance towards LGBT people in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout her reign, Catherine {{remained}} {{committed to}} intellectual pursuits and encouraged {{members of her}} court to engage in them as well. The empress provided her palace staff with a library and reportedly spent an average of 80,000 rubles annually on books. [...] In his essay, [...] "Catherine the Great: Enlightened Empress?" [...] Simon Henderson implores the reader to consider the constraints the empress faced when deciding if she was truly an enlightened despot. Henderson asserts that despite her deceptive tactics, she always possessed an [...] "unswerving commitment to modernizing Russia,". Early on, Catherine concerned herself with the philosophies {{and culture of the}} enlightenment. Though she often agreed with their liberal positions, her status in court was entirely reliant upon the support of noble families. As a result, the Empress could not always implement reforms the way she would have liked. For example, when confronted with the issue of serfdom, Catherine initially suggested in her proposal of [...] "the Instruction" [...] that landowners offer serfs the option to [...] "purchase their freedom" [...] or that the government limit the period of servitude to six years. However, the nobles omitted this section from the document as it did not benefit them. [...] "Rather than seeing her as insincere in her concern for the peasantry, historians have recently highlighted…what she might have achieved had the circumstances been different,". Despite the constraints, Catherine did manage to implement few policies that benefitted the serfs. In 1767 it was forbidden for foster parents to enserf illegitimate children and in 1781 enserfment of prisoners of war was prohibited and a law passes that saw marriage of a free man to a serf woman emancipate the woman. Catherine is known to have investigated and then bought out landowners who were reported to ill-treat their serfs,. Voltaire outwardly supported emancipation of the serfs. The philosopher believed that the Russian aristocracy [...] "should not permit {{the vast majority of the}} people to go on suffering from the arbitrariness of [...] very laws who ought to be to afford protection to each and all,". Furthermore, in an attempt to create a more educated bureaucracy, Catherine moved to bring better education to her people. In 1786, she established the Russian Statute of National Education to launch a national school system. As a result of her campaign to modify Russia, Catherine successfully introduced the tsardom to the Western world and furthered the degree to which it was involved in European affairs. While Catherine worked to bring enlightenment principles to Russia, Voltaire worked to improve her reputation in Europe. The philosopher enthusiastically adopted her cause, commending her to friends in high places, advising her in politics, and distributing her texts to <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>media,</b> thereby cementing her title as an enlightened despot. [...] "Voltaire participated in a campaign to protect Catherine's reputation…he wrote pamphlets in support of her policies… published her pronouncements in the western press,". In a letter to Marquis D'Argenson, a French statesman, Voltaire asked him to help [...] "re-establish [...] reputation in Paris", (Lentin 13). Catherine, happy with rise to popularity, admits to Prince De Ligne: [...] "It was certainly Voltaire who brought me into fashion,".|$|E
