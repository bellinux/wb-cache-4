50|$|Prepainted metal {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of products. It can be formed for many {{different}} applications, including those with T bends, without loss of coating quality. Major industries use prepainted metal in products such as building panels, metal roofs wall panels, garage doors, office furniture (desks, cubicle divider panels, file cabinets, and modular cabinets), home appliances (refrigerators, dishwashers, freezers, range hoods, microwave ovens, and washers and dryers), heating and air-conditioning outer panels and ductwork, commercial appliances, vending machines, foodservice equipment and cooking tins, beverage cans, and automotive panels and parts (fuel <b>tanks,</b> <b>body</b> panels, bumpers), The list continues to grow, with new industries making the switch from post-painted to prepainted processes each year.|$|R
50|$|The {{main body}} of the {{supporting}} shaft was built up by slip forming. Around it, the water tank was constructed in prestressed concrete at ground level: Stiffness is provided by 0.35 m thick walls, which subdivide it into sixteen sectors. The 0.30 m thick tank bottom is angled at 17° to the horizontal, the top surface is shallower. The container was raised into its final position by cables: once in position the lifting cables were used to support the <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> from the ring beam on the shaft, being tensioned within concrete columns. Finally the base of the tank was concreted to the tower shaft.|$|E
50|$|A Liquid Resistor is an {{electrical}} resistor {{in which the}} resistive element is a liquid. Fixed-value liquid resistors are typically used where very high power dissipation is required. They {{are used in the}} rotor circuits of large slip ring induction motors to control starting current, torque and to limit large electrical fault currents (while other protection systems operate to clear or isolate the fault). They typically have electrodes made of welded steel plate (galvanised to reduce corrosion), suspended by insulated connections in a conductive chemical solution held in a tank - which may be open or enclosed. The <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> is normally solidly grounded or earthed. A typical unit can be rated for continuous use, or for short periods when used for current limitation in protection systems.|$|E
5000|$|A 12-issue series, {{the series}} {{expanded}} the original G1 mythos {{from the small}} war on Earth and Cybertron to enclose {{the whole of the}} Galaxy that was fast being altered into a likeness of Cybertron itself by the Cybertronian Empire, a race of later generation Transformers that evolved while the earthbound Autobots and Decepticons were deactivated. The events of this series were actually set in motion with a crossover from the G.I. Joe comic books #138-142, in 1993. Megatron returns in his new <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> to reclaim his leadership from Bludgeon {{and by the end of}} the series joins with Optimus Prime to fight against the G2 Decepticons and their genetic offshoot, the Swarm. The series ended with an epic battle between the [...] "Generation 1" [...] Transformers, the Cybertronians and the Swarm. It also introduces the Liege Maximo. However, the series was cancelled with issue #12 due to low sales, forcing a quick conclusion to the series' various plot threads. Outside of the 12 issue series, Marvel published a free 8 page comic that was given away at various stores selling the G2 toyline called The Transformers Generation 2: Halloween Special Edition in 1993.|$|E

Space basing effected substantial reductions in cryogenic insulation, <b>tank,</b> and <b>body</b> structure. The <b>tank</b> and <b>body</b> structural masses are {{shown to be}} lower for space basing because of the larger difference in acceleration loads between the on-orbit case (0. 2 g's) and delivery (3. 0 g's), the latter applying to ground-based vehicles which are delivered to orbit fully loaded with propellants. Insulation masses are lower because {{of the absence of}} an atmosphere and the attendant heat transfer losses.

30|$|Figure 5 {{displays}} {{the results of}} the Tank image. In the HE result shown in Figure 5 a, the contrast between the tank and its surrounding is significantly increased. However, the details in the darker area of the <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> are barely noticeable. 2 DHE alleviates the drawback of HE by considering the contextual information in the image when producing the 2 D histogram, which makes the details of the <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> better perceived. However, it produces a higher contrast image but brighter image overall, especially on the ground. AR leads to an image that is almost similar to its original, and hence contrast has been poorly improved. MCE retains more detail than the image obtained with AR. However, the photometric difference between the tank and its surrounding is still limited. The output of NGF is visually pleasing and the contrast between the tank and its surrounding is high enough to reveal details on both areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In large power transformers, the {{presence}} of stray currents in the structural elements near the high current bush-ings can be considerable, and this leads to hot spots. This work presents a practical analysis of overheating in the bolts that join the tank and the cover, which are near the high current bush-ings of the transformer. Overheating results are analyzed and discussed for {{the case of a}} 420 -MVA transformer. The hot spots in the flange–bolt regions are discovered by thermal maps that are obtained during power transformer operation {{as a part of a}} preventive maintenance program. In this paper, we use copper links to ensure the connection of both the cover and <b>tank</b> <b>body,</b> sig-nificantly reducing the overheating of the flange–bolt region. The copper link solution has been validated by measurements. We have used calibrated measurement instruments in all the experiments. Moreover, a 3 -D finite-element analysis of the geometry of interes...|$|E

50|$|The KC-135Q variant was {{modified}} to carry JP-7 fuel {{necessary for the}} Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, segregating the JP-7 from the KC-135s own fuel supply (the <b>body</b> <b>tanks</b> carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM-56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main <b>body</b> <b>tanks</b> from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T {{is the presence of}} a clear window {{on the underside of the}} empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the <b>body</b> <b>tanks</b> and wing tanks separately.|$|R

40|$|Background—A {{recent study}} {{demonstrated}} {{the ability of}} electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) to reconstruct, noninva-sively, epicardial potentials, electrograms, and activation sequences (isochrones) generated by epicardial activation. The current study expands the earlier work to the three-dimensional myocardium and investigates the ability of ECGI to characterize intramural myocardial activation noninvasively and to relate it to the underlying fiber structure of the myocardium. This objective is motivated {{by the fact that}} cardiac excitation and arrhythmogenesis involve the three-dimensional ventricular wall and its anisotropic structure. Methods and Results—Intramural activation was initiated by pacing a dog heart in a human torso <b>tank.</b> <b>Body</b> surface potentials (384 electrodes) were used to compute epicardial potentials noninvasively. Accuracy of reconstructed epicardial potentials was evaluated by direct comparison to measured ones (134 electrodes). Protocols included pacing from five intramural depths. Epicardial potentials showed characteristic patterns (1) early in activation, central negative region with two flanking maxima aligned with the orientation of fibers at the depth of pacing; (2) counterclockwise rotation of positive potentials with time for epicardial pacing, clockwise rotation for subendocardial pacing, and dual rotation for midmyocardial pacing; and (3) central positive region for endocardial pacing. Noninvasively reconstructed potentials closely approximated these patterns. Reconstructed epicardial electrograms and epicardial breakthrough times closely resembled measured ones, demonstrating progressively later epicardial activation with deeper pacing...|$|E

40|$|Xenopus laevis is {{the most}} widely used model {{amphibian}} species in laboratories, yet there is almost no experimental evidence to guide best practice for captive housing. Enrichment is an important component of maintenance and welfare. A split-sibship experimental design was used to rear juvenile X. laevis under one of three treatments for 30 weeks: a control with no enrichment, enrichment from plastic drainpipe, or enrichment from a plastic plant. Location and clustering behaviour were quantified, along with the amount of food eaten and the time to start eating. Many Xenopus users work with eggs or embryos, and are concerned with the growth and size of animals because female size determines reproductive output. Snout-vent length (SVL) and mass were therefore measured every 3 weeks. After 30 weeks, final measurements included fat body mass in both males and females, and ovary mass and stage of development in females. Enrichment did not effect the time to start eating, or the amount of food eaten, and there were no differences in growth (SVL or mass) between treatments. There were also no differences in final mean per <b>tank</b> <b>body</b> mass, SVL, head width or fat body mass, or the coefficients of variation of these per tank measures. Ovary mass and developmental stage were both correlated with final body mass, but there was no effect of enrichment on these measures of female reproductive potential. However, there were clear differences in behaviour between treatments. Animals used enrichment in a variety of ways. Animals in tanks with drainpipes lay inside or alongside the pipe. Animals in tanks with plants lay under, against the base of, or among the fronds of the plant. Plants were used more than drainpipes, but enrichment in either form resulted in animals spending less time against the edge of tanks, and less time clustered together. Animals from enriched tanks also had smaller startle responses, suggesting they may have been less stressed. They were harder to catch in tanks than controls, but this {{was the result of the}} enrichment itself: once the enrichment was removed there was no difference in capture times. Overall, there is no evidence that enrichment limited the growth or reproductive potential of X. laevis, and clear evidence that they used it when it was available. Enrichment should therefore be provided to captive X. laevis as standard unless there is a well-defined reason not to do so...|$|E
