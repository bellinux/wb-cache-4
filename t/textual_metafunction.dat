30|$|The <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> {{functions}} to create “relevance to context” (Halliday and Matthiesen, 2014, p. 85). For instance, focussing on ‘context’, {{the system of}} Reference locates endophoric (internal to the text) or exophoric (external) meanings (Martin, 1992) to develop cohesion within the co-text and coherence with the context (Halliday and Hasan, 1985). Through Reference, the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> ties experiential and interpersonal meanings to a particular co-text and context (of culture and of situation). Without this contextualising function, those meanings could be considered to remain abstract. If we focus on ‘relevance’, the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> creates relevance by adding prominence through assigning relative value to parts of the clause (Matthiessen 1992). The Theme, for instance, {{functions to}} select meaning(s) from the clause (Hannay & Martínez Caro, 2008) and to assign them thematic prominence, which has consequences for the thematic development of the text (Fries, 1992) in contrast to meanings in Rheme. At the same time, New Information functions to highlight specific meanings, to direct the listener’s or reader’s attention to those meanings enabling them to be newsworthy (Fries, 2002), in contrast to ‘Given’ non-newsworthy meanings. Importantly, assigning relevance through thematic and informational prominence contributes to the construal of the co-text and context of the text. It is only through the dual processes of positioning experiential and interpersonal meanings in relation to context and giving them relative value that experiential and interpersonal meanings can operate in text. We can propose, then, that the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> instantiates experiential and interpersonal meanings.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the effect of ‘textual metafunction’ on the levels of {{coherence}} and cohesion in the Iranian EFL learners’ English writing performance. Sixty Iranian intermediate EFL learners who were adult females participated in this study were randomly divided into two groups; experimental, and control. They were given a writing pre-test. Then both groups’ subjects attended an essay writing class, two sessions per week, for a ten-week term; however, while the experimental group was taught how to write a standard three-paragraph essay in English, and apply the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> in it, the control group was only taught how to write a standard three-paragraph essay. After the completion of the instructional period, both groups were given a writing post-test in which they were asked to write a standard three-paragraph essay on a subject. The analytic scoring scale of ‘Hungarian School-Leaving English Examination Reform’ (2001, as cited in Tankó, 2001) was employed by three independent raters for rating the writing samples. A ‘t-test’ on the mean scores of both groups indicated {{a significant difference between the}} scores of the post-tests, meaning that the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> was significantly effective in the experimental group’s writing task. Moreover, while the mean scores of the control group’s pre-post tests were the same, the mean score of the experimental group’s post-test was higher than that of the pre-test, meaning that <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> increased the levels of cohesion and coherence in their writing task. </p...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} clause {{complexity}} of the clauses with relevant tokens, {{the study of the}} calibration of cohesive chains with other metafunctions is fore grounded in this analysis. The cohesive chains realize the semantic continuity and the texture of the text. Through the cohesive chains, both identity and similarity, the plot is continuous, with the strings of events and characters under a certain context, in narrative texts. Since the study of cohesive chains reveals the continuity of the text, such a study {{can be seen as the}} basis for further investigation into the textual coherence of a text. As stated in the framework, the realization of coherence at the lexicogrammatical level is reflected in the analysis from the perspectives of the logical and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions.</b> In addition, the combination of the logical relations and cohesive chains demonstrates how the semantic continuity of the text is realized grammatically via the progression of the clauses. The different logical relations may have different functions in the creation of the text. The coherence of the text can be expressed by the lexicogrammatical patterns of the combination of the logical and textual.|$|R

40|$|After {{introducing}} {{the notion that}} meaning-making during reading includes both inter-personal and intra-personal meaning-making and exploring several issues raised by any attempt to research this activity, a number of gaps are identified in the current model of the reading transaction, arising largely from Rosenbla~t's only-partial adoption of concepts from Peirce. Wiley's re-focusing of Peirce's theories of meaning and the dialogical self is then used as a starting-point for the modification of the transactional model {{and a variety of}} disciplinary perspectives are drawn on to propose ways in which the transactional model might encompass multimodal intra- and inter-personal dialogical meaning-making activity. After an account of the case study, selected semiotic resources are analyzed as instances of multimodal intra-personal, dialogical meaning-making activity embedded in higher-scalar ecosocial systems of interpretance and constituted by ideational, interpersonal and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions.</b> An attempt is úthen made first to demonstrate the multimodality of intra-personal meaning-making activity through the exploration of descriptions of meaning-making activity involving sound, and then to examine the role of emotion in intra-personal meaning-making.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a corpus stylistic study of the {{language}} of soliloquies in Shakespeare’s plays. Literary corpus stylistics can use corpus linguistic methods to test claims made by literary critics and identify hitherto unnoticed features. Existing literary studies of soliloquies tend to define and classify them, to trace the history of the form or to offer literary appreciation; yet they pay surprisingly little attention to the language which characterises soliloquies. By creating a soliloquy corpus and a dialogue corpus from 37 Shakespeare plays, and comparing the former against the latter using WordSmith Tools, I identify key language forms in soliloquies. Using an analytical framework broadly based on Halliday’s ideational, interpersonal and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions</b> of language, I interpret my results and relate them, where possible, to literary critical interpretations. I also compare comedy, history and tragedy soliloquy corpora. My main findings show the following linguistic features to be characteristic of soliloquies in general: words relating to mental states and the body; pragmatic noise; linking adverbials and first-person pronouns. Characteristic forms in comedy, history and tragedy emphasise love, the monarch and the supernatural respectively. The empirical evidence presented here shows that Shakespeare regularly exploited certain language forms in soliloquies to represent expressions of doubt, resolve, introspection and strong emotion, among others. These forms not only add depth to characterisation, aid plot development and provide performance cues for actors, but may also conform to certain audience expectations...|$|R
30|$|As stated before, the {{collaborative}} {{effect of the}} <b>textual</b> and logical <b>metafunctions</b> can be probed through the logical relations of clauses with relevant tokens.

30|$|Information, Reference and Theme are {{the three}} {{principal}} systems in the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> that operate within the clause (Martin, 1992; Fries, 2000; 2002).

For instance, in speech, the nominal group receiving indefinite (Presenting) reference in clause-final position (Rheme) is likely to receive the tonic foot (New information) to provide an unmarked combination. Significant rhetorical advantage can be gained from skillful manipulation of these three systems in producing text (Lassen, 2004; Moore, 2006).|$|E
3000|$|SFL {{recognises}} four metafunctions: (i) The ‘experiential’ {{concerns the}} {{resources for the}} exchange of experience: the lexicogrammar of languages encodes human experience of the external and internal world as processes of various kinds occurring in time and entailing entities as participants, as well as specifying circumstances that elaborate aspects of process-participant configurations. (ii) The ‘logical’ metafunction concerns {{the relations between the}} various individual process-participant configurations; it also elaborates on the nature of entities, processes and circumstances by relating them in different ways to a set of properties. According to Halliday ([1973]), these two metafunctions are closely related and together they have been referred to as ‘ideational’f. (iii) The ‘interpersonal’ metafunction enacts social relations, including the speaker’s assessments of possibilities, the evaluation of phenomena, attitude to self and others as well as commitment to the interactive process. Finally (iv) the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> contributes to ‘the creation of text’ (Halliday, [1973]: 99): the meaning wording patterns oriented to the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> encode ‘the structure of information, and the relation of each part of the discourse to the whole and to the setting’ (Halliday, ibid.).

40|$|A problem arose {{during a}} study aiming to {{investigate}} affordances of professional, academic and regulatory discourses for mathematics teachers describing their own classroom practices. One {{aim was to}} seek each teacher’s own choice of words so an approach was adopted to help the researcher avoid putting words into participants’ mouths. As a result, the teachers’ accounts were initially tentative, role relationships were negotiable and language choices took longer to make. What challenges are there for researchers seeking mathematics teachers’ accounts of their own classroom practices? How can relationships be established {{during the early stages}} of research without the researcher putting words into the teachers’ mouths? Is it possible to elicit original and authentic accounts and what, if anything, might originality and authenticity mean in this context? Initial fieldwork involved observing and videoing lessons and interviewing the teacher afterwards using the video as stimulus. Video aided recall was used to limit the need for the interviewer to introduce language in order to seek descriptions. This was important for the research to avoid inadvertently introducing discourses not chosen by the teacher. I adopt a perspective on language as social semiotic (Halliday, 1978). The analytical framework of systemic functional linguistics seeing language as having ideational, interpersonal and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions</b> is useful. Paying attention to the ideational function offers insights into the agency of speakers in their constructions of experience. Paying attention to the interpersonal function offers insights into the relationships between participants in the interview (researcher and teacher). Paying attention to the textual function offers insights into how purpose emerges over time. This research with mathematics teachers in London, England will be relevant for any subject teachers in any country where teachers have a range of discourses to navigate when articulating their practices in different situations with different people for different purposes. It was found that, at least for these teachers, notions of originality and authenticity in accounts of classroom practices must be expressed with nuance to be meaningful. The analysis reveals that accounts are contingent on institutional settings, relationships between participants and reflexively on language choices. HALLIDAY, M. A. K.

40|$|Current policy {{mandates}} that emergent bilingual (EB) students partake in standardized assessments {{before they are}} fully proficient in English. Additionally, standardized assessments are quickly converting to an online administration. The increase in design features inherent in computer-based assessments will most likely {{increase the number of}} construct-irrelevant factors and affect the accessibility of assessment items for EBs. This study used frequency analyses, descriptive statistics, item semiotic complexity measures, Spearman’s rank-order correlation, one- and two-way analysis of variance, and Chi-square test of independence to examine the semiotic components and complexity of items included in a Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Grade 8 practice test, and how the semiotic features of the items affected non-EB and EB students as they solved four of the items. Results indicate that the SBAC items have different ideational, interpersonal, and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions</b> as well as intersemiotic relations than items in curriculum resources. The average item semiotic complexity was approximately 69 components, indicating that students had to correctly interpret, as intended by the item writers, 69 different constituents to answer an item correctly. Regardless of language group, students’ reported actions and thinking involved very few semiotic components or intersemiotic relations belonging to the test items. For all items combined, EBs had a higher total cognitive load than non-EBs. As item semiotic complexity increased, EBs’ scores decreased while non-EBs’ scores remained constant once a certain item semiotic complexity level was reached. Results indicate that as cognitive load decreased, total score increased for both language groups. Additionally, total cognitive load negatively affected both groups of students during problem-solving and non-EBs during interpretation. This study provides the PARCC and SBAC assessment consortia with information relevant to designing test items using multiple semiotic resources used in computer-based assessments in ways that are sensitive to the characteristics of EB students.

How do the student-writers construct their voice and express themselves in their blog-texts? 4. What {{is the role of}} blogs in EFL writing classes {{in the context of this}} study? The study uses a systemic functional framework focusing on register and genre analyses. The register analysis was carried out using UAM software, through which the ideational, interpersonal and <b>textual</b> <b>metafunctions</b> of the blog-texts were examined. The register analysis showed that these blogs are an informative type of blogs with a weak tenor indicating the characteristics of both spoken and written modes of language. The genre analysis showed that the blog-texts are generally consistent with Rose and Martin’s (2012, p. 130) genre categories. It also indicated a genre hybridity in some blog-texts, through which blog-texts signify the stages of various genres. The register analysis also helped in understanding how student-writers construed their textual self-expression, voice and stance. This study contributes to the present knowledge on how meanings are constructed throughout the discourse in online environments such as blogs; it supports and advances the previous investigations regarding online genre/s and register. The findings can have implications in ELT, as teachers can identify the particular lexico-grammatical features that need to be introduced in writing classes regarding text types; it can be also a way to recognise what learners know and need to know about the genre and register of texts.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that many second language learners have difficulties with cohesion in academic texts.   Writing {{seems to be}} the most difficult subject for many students. To produce good writing, it is necessary to know how to organize Theme and Rheme in a text. Thematic structure as an important feature in <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> plays a significant role in promoting the textual coherence. This research is concerned with the insights presenting the relationship between theme and rheme derived from Systemic Functional Linguistics. Halliday (1994) claimed that the structuring of language as a message is realized in the thematic structures of the constituent clauses of a text. To Halliday, the basic unit for thematic analysis is the clause. Thereby, this study was an attempt to compare different thematic types and thematic progression patterns in EFL students' academic writing texts. For this purpose, the researcher selected 30 MA students of English language teaching as the participants of the study after administering a TOEFL test and excluding the outliers. Each participant was required to write three different types of argumentative, process and cause & affect compositions. The collected data were analyzed according to the Thematization process from the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> aspects. The results showed some differences in the thematic structure of the different types of compositions. The findings of this study have some implications to the EFL students.

The aim of this research is to investigate the linguistic choices made in translated texts. The investigation is conducted through the examination of a sample of more than 40 translated texts and their originals, selected from an archive of some two hundred pairs of texts, which are used as referential resources to illustrate the most common issues found in English into Vietnamese translation. The texts range across many areas of government services from resettlement issues, to housing, education and common health issues, with a particular focus on mental health. The research has been inspired by several underlining questions concerning the relationship between translation theory and practice and linguistic theory, as well as the possible applicability of linguistic notions and methodologies to further the understanding and seeking solutions for many translation problems. It explores various linguistic notions in explaining and describing the most common issues in translation. It then goes on to examine different analytical tools in text analysis for translation purposes such as register analysis, discourse analysis, metafunction analysis, and genre analysis. Eventually it rests with the <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> analysis, the notion proposed by Halliday (1967, 1985, 1994), which is the language component responsible for organizing and constructing the two other language components; i. e. ideational and interpersonal, into a message. Or, as described by Halliday and Matthiessen (1999 : 512), the most important function of the textual component is that it creates information “[and] engenders discourse, the patterned forms of wording that constitute meaningful semiotic contexts. ”The <b>textual</b> <b>metafunction</b> consists of two interrelated systems, the thematic and information systems, which {{play a crucial role in}} the creation of discourse in a communicative event. The research, however, has a particular interest in investigating the impact caused by the transfer of the thematic structure of the source language text (ST) into that of the target language (TT). In order to achieve the above aim certain theoretical notions such as Theme and Rheme, as well as thematic structure, are discussed in the light of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL); and the linguistic resources used to realize Theme in both languages are looked into. With respect to translation, a detailed discussion regarding the relationship between a particular choice of Theme and the intended meaning of the text covers both Chapter IV and Chapter V of the study. The research also examines how meanings made through the thematic choices in the original texts are interpreted and reproduced by the translator, and the effect of this upon the translations.

40|$|This study explores some {{semiotic}} modes {{and resources}} {{employed in the}} live performances of drag queens {{with the purpose of}} decoding those non-linguistic factors that seem {{to play a major role}} in the construction of gender queer identities in the media. The media considerably shape social attitudes and learning, specifically recurring images, juxtaposed with positive contexts, on TV screens may boost social change in society. The wide spectrum of nonverbal behavioral cues that gender bender performers display in their live shows, such as body orientation, gesture, gaze, facial expressions, vocalisation, posture, vestemics, etc., can be read as important behavioral indicators. They contribute to help the audience understand and prime, beyond the face value of the words, affective, emotional and in particular social aspects of the interactions the non-binary performers intend to construe. The semiotic investigation of the dominant trope of gender variation in contemporary live performances may shed light to the novel representations and discursive constructions of alternative forms of non-hegemonic gender and heteronormativity in social and cultural contexts. From a methodological viewpoint, this chapter, by exploring the nature of systemic functional representation through Kress and van Leeuwen’s semioticisation of Halliday’s ideational, <b>textual</b> and representational <b>metafunctions,</b> intends to critically analyse contemporary discourses on gender through the analysis of the re-semioticisation of semantic prosody into ‘semiotic prosody’ of minor gendered social actors. The multimodal gendered discourses under scrutiny aim at the deconstruction of hegemonic masculinity through complex semiotic propositions, which, at a first analysis, seem to display ‘live narrative processes’ embedded in highly figurative Reactional processes...|$|R

Literature relating to this, and extending to the related contexts of the UK and Australia has been reviewed. The approach taken is an investigation of top-rated senior secondary writing in subject English, using elements of Hallidayan Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). The concepts of SFG chiefly drawn upon, namely, Theme and linguistic metafunctions, and their application to the data are presented and explained. This grammatical model was chosen because it allows the interface of grammatical structure and linguistic function to be explored, which in turn permits insight into how the qualities of top-rated writing may be formulated grammatically. This insight may then become part of teaching resources in academic writing by way of both pre- and in-service training material for teachers. Over 100 top-rated English literature essays (graded by teachers) were collected from students, via their schools, so that the data obtained were authentic. Two samples were collected: timed and untimed writing. Each sentence of each essay was typed into one of nine Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, representing locations within the essay. The nine locations were: three introduction locations: initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; three paragraph locations (all paragraphs in the body of the essays, not introductions or conclusions) : initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; and, three conclusion locations: initial sentence, medial sentences and terminal sentence. The initial grammatical elements and their metafunction(s) for each sentence were categorised. Percentages in each category for each location were calculated so that individual locations could be compared for grammatical and metafunctional characteristics. Grouped locations were also considered where this seemed felicitous; for instance, introductions were compared to conclusions or medial sentences compared to boundary sentences (initial and terminal). Comparisons were also made between the timed and untimed samples. The results showed that some grammatical structures could be associated with particular grouped locations and metafunctional characteristics were not independent of location. The research was also able to suggest grammatical means to achieve metafunctional effects that align with descriptors for writing given by examination boards. For example, clear, logical organisation of writing is highly valued by examination boards. This is achieved by means of elements that perform the <b>textual</b> linguistic <b>metafunction.</b> A variety of grammatical elements to perform this function and their most prominent locations were identified. It is intended that the findings may be a highly directed way to help teachers address some of the writing challenges faced by their students at secondary level...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta dissertação é examinar o metadiscurso textual e o interpessoal em seis introduções de artigos científicos coletados em periódicos de três universidades brasileiras na área da Linguística Aplicada: D. E. L. T. A (PUC/SP), ALFA (UNESP) e Cadernos de Estudos Linguísticos e Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada (UNICAMP). O exame do metadiscurso implica recorrer a teorias de origens várias. Nesse sentido, seguimos Fowler (1991), que se confessa essencialmente eclético em relação à sua atitude aos instrumentos de análise, mas que, aponta como o melhor modelo para examinar a conexão entre estrutura lingüística e valores sociais, o modelo funcional desenvolvido por Halliday e seus pesquisadores. Constituem, também, objeto de interesse de minha análise e que embasam a metodologia da presente pesquisa, os conceitos de: (a) metafunção interpessoal (Halliday, 1985; 1994; 2004) e token de atitude (MARTIN, 2000); (b) avaliação (MARTIN, 2000; HYLAND, 1997; 1998; 2000; 2005; VERSTRAETE, 2001) (c) footing e alinhamento (GOFFMAN, 1974); (d) polidez (BROWN & LEVINSON (1987) This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the <b>textual</b> and interpersonal <b>metafunctions</b> present {{in the introduction to}} six scientific articles found in four different journals on Applied Linguistics published by three Brazilian universities: D. E. L. T. A (PUC/SP), ALFA (UNESP), Cadernos de Estudos Linguísticos and Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada (UNICAMP). In order to carry out the research on metadiscourse we will draw on the work of different authors and on various theoretical approaches. In this respect, Fowler (1991), whose attitude towards his instruments of analysis is eclectic, acknowledges that the Hallidayan functional mode of analysis is the best model {{for the study of the}} relationship between linguistic structure and social values. As well as being another topic of concern in this study, the following concepts will also ground the methodology of this research: (a) interpersonal metafunction (HALLIDAY, 1985; 1994; 2004) and tokens of attitude (MARTIN, 2000); (b) appraisal (MARTIN, 2000; HYLAND, 1997; 1998; 2000; 2005; VERSTRAETE, 2001); (c) footing and alignment (GOFFMAN, 1974); (d) politeness (BROWN & LEVINSON (1987...|$|R
