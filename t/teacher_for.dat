5|$|Krishna worship or reverence {{has been}} adopted by several new {{religious}} movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes {{a member of an}} eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a Great Initiate, while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> humanity along with Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Waldron has {{influenced}} later generations of pianists. Examples are Matthew Shipp and Stanley Cowell. Another, Ethan Iverson, describes Waldron {{as one of}} his biggest influences, and reports having imitated most aspects of the older man's style during his own musical development, through listening to Waldron's recordings. Waldron contributed more personally to Ran Blake's progress: he was Blake's <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> a time, helping him to improve his rhythmic flexibility and idea development.|$|E

5|$|Field {{attended}} Macquarie University {{to receive}} training {{in early childhood}} education, and founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991.

Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E

5|$|Piru Singh {{was born}} on 20 May 1918, in village Beri, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He {{was the son of}} Lal Singh. His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and grew up to be well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside.

When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Arévalo Bermejo {{was born}} into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> a brief while, and then earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, {{the fact that he had}} chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E
5|$|Lamont's {{childhood}} was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, {{where she and}} her brother David spent their summer holidays. She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education. Like her parents, she was a Gaelic speaker, but she did not believe she spoke it well enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German. It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize. She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA. Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement. She trained as a <b>teacher</b> <b>for</b> a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, Isle of Bute, as a teacher in 1979. She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified teachers, {{which has led to}} a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked professional training.
