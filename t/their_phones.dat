5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge <b>their</b> <b>phones</b> and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{examines}} the nature of online social interactions, {{and the way in which}} social media has changed how people, particularly younger people, connect with one another.
