5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{the study}} proposes {{a type of}} simple and {{reasonable}} method to set <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> The concept of fractional factorial design was expected to enable scientific DEMATEL <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> and to avoid subjective DEMATEL <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
30|$|Some {{researchers}} use various {{methods to}} set up the <b>threshold</b> <b>value,</b> whereas some ignore explanations about the <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> setting (Li and Tzeng 2009; Hu et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2013). However, an overly high <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> inappropriately reduces the significance of expert opinions and oversimplifies the problem, whereas an exceedingly low <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> results in divergent opinions and a lack of focus. Therefore, if a <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> cannot appropriately differentiate expert opinions, it cannot accurately present the critical factors of a complex problem.|$|R
30|$|DEMATEL <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> is set {{based on}} Lenth’s {{principles}} of distinguishing effect significance, whereby <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> and ME are adopted to eliminate nonsignificant factors for obtaining factors with significant influences in scenarios with complex problems or factors. When Lenth’s method {{is combined with}} the DEMATEL method, suitable <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> can be determined by calculating ME value, and problems resulting from inappropriate DEMATEL <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> can be effectively resolved.|$|R
25|$|In many cases, {{only one}} side of the range is usually of interest, such as with markers of {{pathology}} including cancer antigen 19-9, where it is generally without any clinical significance to have a value below what is usual in the population. Therefore, such targets are often given with only one limit of the reference range given, and, strictly, such values are rather cut-off values or <b>threshold</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sweetness is subjectively {{measured}} {{by comparing the}} <b>threshold</b> <b>values,</b> or level at which {{the presence of a}} dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances. Substances are usually measured relative to sucrose, which is usually given an arbitrary index of 1 or 100. Fructose is about 1.4 times sweeter than sucrose; glucose, a sugar found in honey and vegetables, is about three-quarters as sweet; and lactose, a milk sugar, is one-half as sweet.|$|E
25|$|BitTorrent peers use tit-for-tat {{strategy}} to optimize their download speed. More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use {{a variant of}} Tit for two Tats which is called regular unchoking in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have {{a limited number of}} upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will choke the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. Regular unchoking corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner’s dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (unchoke). This is called optimistic unchoking. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> of this strategy are still the subject of research.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} a conventional <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> purely using expert opinions or researcher judgments {{and to prevent}} inappropriate <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> from affecting the definitions of problems, some scholars studied the setting of DEMATEL <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> For instance, Li and Tzeng (2009) proposed a maximum mean de-entropy algorithms (MMDE) to determine <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> MMDE was mainly used to decide whether a node is suitable to express in the impact-relations map. However, in the past, operating with subjective expert opinions, DEMATEL {{was unable to find}} appropriate <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> Even though some scholars proposed the MMDE method, that method did not alleviate the problem of computational complexity.|$|R

The {{quality of the}} reconstructed surface improves with increase in angle <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> But, increase in angle <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> leads to increase in computation time (Fig.  31). An angle <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> of 90 ° is generally preferred in a dense and noise free point cloud.

Setting this threshold close to zero and using a high growth rate for the table size leads to faster hash table operations but greater memory usage than <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> close to one and [...] low growth rates. A common choice would be to double the table size when the load factor would exceed 1/2, causing the load factor to stay between 1/4 and 1/2.|$|E

A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b–9 (1–35), therefore the weight b1 is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 × 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence: ...|$|E
2500|$|Economists Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs have {{separately}} {{noted that}} {{there appears to be}} little correlation between measured economic freedom and economic growth when the least free countries are disregarded, as indicated by the strong growth of the Chinese economy in recent years. Morris Altman found that there is a relatively large correlation between economic freedom and both per capita income and per capita growth. He argues that this is especially true when it comes to sub-indices relating to property rights and sound money, while he calls into question the importance of sub-indices relating to labor regulation and government size once certain <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> are passed. John Miller further observes that Hong Kong and Singapore, both only [...] "partially free" [...] according to Freedom House, are leading countries on both economic freedom indices and casts doubt on the claim that measured economic freedom is associated with political freedom. However, according to the Freedom House, [...] "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey." ...|$|E

Threshold segmentation has the advantage of simple calculation, high efficiency operation, and high speed.

The chloride <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> decreased with decreasing the Ca(OH) 2 content in concrete, and there was an approximate linear relationship between the logarithm of chloride <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> and the logarithm of Ca(OH) 2 content when the specimens exposed in tidal zone.
