5|$|On September 22, 1915, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> during {{construction}} of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting {{for most of the}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E
5|$|An early {{version of}} the modern {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> {{in the number of}} conduct books published {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off the plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> of new lemur {{descriptions}} and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for museums, menageries, and cabinets. Some {{of the major}} collectors were Johann Maria Hildebrandt and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum systematists including Albert Günther and John Edward Gray continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of Alfred Grandidier, a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself {{to the study of}} Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of Alphonse Milne-Edwards, most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by Ernst Schwarz in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen {{in time for the}} law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed {{that one of the}} 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|With the {{conversion}} of much of England in the 6th and 7th centuries, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> of local church building. English monasteries formed the main basis for the church, however, and were often sponsored by local rulers, taking various forms, including mixed communities headed by abbesses, bishop-led communities of monks, and others formed around married priests and their families. Cathedrals were constructed, staffed either with secular canons in the European tradition or, uniquely to England, chapters of monks. These institutions were badly affected in the 9th century by Viking raids and predatory annexations by the nobility. By {{the start of the}} 10th century, monastic lands, financial resources and the quality of monasteries' religious work had been much diminished. Reforms followed under the kings of Wessex who promoted the Benedictine rule then popular on the Continent. A reformed network of around 40 monastic institutions across the south and east of England, under the protection of the king, helped re-establish royal control over the reconquered Danelaw.|$|E

25|$|At 15:36 JST on 12 March, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> in {{the reactor}} {{building}} at Unit 1.
