5|$|The reserve, located partly along {{a valley}} between the Lesser Himalaya {{in the north}} and the Shivaliks in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>has</b> a sub-Himalayan belt structure. The upper {{tertiary}} rocks are exposed towards the base of the Shiwalik range and hard sandstone units form broad ridges. Characteristic longitudinal valleys, geographically termed Doons, or Duns can be seen formed along the narrow tectonic zones between lineaments.|$|E
5|$|Stretford {{is one of}} {{the four}} major urban areas in Trafford; the other three are Altrincham, Sale and Urmston. The area {{historically}} known as Stretford, between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>has</b> since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government wards of Clifford, Longford, Gorse Hill, and Stretford. Each ward is represented by three local councillors, giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council. The wards elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle. As of the 2014 local elections, all 12 of the councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} side of Kenongo Island is a row of small {{buildings}} called the Tajug. These buildings were originally used as air vents for the tunnel located below the lake. This underground tunnel, constructed in 1761,was an alternative way to reach the Kenongo Island other than by a vessel. Also on {{the south side}} of the Kenongo Island is another artificial island called Cemethi Island (Javanese Pulo Cemethi) or Panembung Island (Javanese Pulo Panembung). It is a one-storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate, or some said, a hiding place for the royal family during an attack. Another name for this island is Sumur Gumantung, because on {{the south side of}} this island is a well that hangs above the ground. This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel. The building of Cemethi Island is now also in ruin. A legend says that there is a secret tunnel that connects the palace with the south sea (Indian Ocean) where Nyai Roro Kidul or the Queen of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> her palace. The supernatural Queen becomes the spiritual wife of Yogyakarta Sultan for many generations.|$|E

50|$|These {{changes were}} very unwelcome in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> {{and contributed to}} turn the {{insurgency}} in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> into a real civil war. In consequence educational facilities in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>have</b> largely disappeared.|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the area}} around the Aral Sea was {{inhabited}} by desert nomads who left few written records. However, the Oxus delta to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>has</b> a long history under the name of Khwarezm. It used to be the westernmost border of Tang dynasty China.|$|E
25|$|The video's {{impact is}} not certain; Huckabee {{was already a}} long-shot {{candidate}} before the video was released, and continued to be very popular among social conservatives and southern Republicans generally, {{despite the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> most of the states with conservative criminal justice systems.|$|E
25|$|After the Reconstruction era, {{most of the}} South was {{politically}} dominated by white conservative Democrats. Lynchings enforced white supremacy and intimidated blacks by racial terrorism. The rate of lynchings in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> been strongly associated with economic strains, although the causal nature of this link is unclear. Low cotton prices, inflation, and economic stress are associated with higher frequencies of lynching.|$|E
50|$|Central Russian is a {{transitional}} stage between the North and <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> {{so some of}} its dialects closer to the North have northern features, and those closer to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> southern ones.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> {{produced}} various {{nationally known}} politicians and political movements. In 1948, {{a group of}} Democratic congressmen, led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by Minneapolis mayor and future senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. They founded the States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party. During that year’s Presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> become solidly Republican in {{national}} elections since 1980, {{and has been}} trending Republican {{at the state level}} since then at a slower pace. In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%–30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70–30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80–20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{presently}} representing only a {{small percentage}} of the economy, a considerable part of continental Portugal is dedicated to agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> developed an extensive monoculture of cereals and olive trees and the Douro Valley of vineyards. Olive trees (4,000km2; 1,545sqmi), vineyards (3,750km2; 1,450sqmi), wheat (3,000km2; 1,160sqmi) and maize (2,680km2; 1,035sqmi) are produced in vast areas. Portuguese wine and olive oil are especially praised by nationals for their quality, thus external competition (even at much lower prices) has had little effect on consumer demand.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, the Walt Disney Company {{produced}} a film {{based on the}} Uncle Remus tales called Song of the South. While commercially successful during its original release and re-releases, the film has never been released for home consumption in the United States as, since its release, the film was criticized for the way it portrays its characters and the Southern U.S. in regard to slavery. Song of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> been released on video {{in a number of}} overseas markets, and on laserdisk in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Overall, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> {{had lower}} {{percentages}} {{of high school}} graduates, lower housing values, lower household incomes, and lower cost of living {{than the rest of}} the United States. These factors, combined with the fact that Southerners have continued to maintain strong loyalty to family ties, has led some sociologists to label white Southerners an ethnic or quasi-ethnic group, though this interpretation has been subject to criticism on the grounds that proponents of the view do not satisfactorily indicate how Southerners meet the criteria of ethnicity.|$|E

The projecting wing to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>has</b> been reduced to two storeys. To the north (right) of the entrance porch was the Wellington Wing, now demolished. Parts of the render on the north wing have fallen off, revealing the timber frame to the upper storeys, which has ornamental panelling including roundel designs, and carved quatrefoil and fleur-de-lys motifs to the main timbers.|$|E
25|$|Several Southern states (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) were British colonies {{that sent}} delegates {{to sign the}} Declaration of Independence and then fought against the {{government}} along with the Northern colonies during the Revolutionary War. The basis for much Southern culture derives from the pride in these states being among the 13 original colonies, and {{from the fact that}} much of the population of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>has</b> strong ancestral links to Colonists who emigrated west. Southern manners and customs reflect the relationship with England and Africa that was held by the early population, with some influences being provided by the Native American populations of the area.|$|E
25|$|The final slab of the Heraklean Amazonomachy, BM 535, is {{separated}} physically from the preceding three, being the single Amazonomachy slab {{on the east}} side. lt also {{is separated}} temporally from the others in that it depicts a moment late in the conflict when the outcome {{is no longer in}} doubt. Thus it follows the pattern of the last scene of the Trojan Amazonomachy, marking the conclusion of the action and commenting on it. The tide of battle, distinctly on the Amazons' side along <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>has</b> now turned against them. Here, BM 535:3, the last of the Amazons is depicted clasping to an altar as she is prised away by a Greek, BM 535:4.|$|E
