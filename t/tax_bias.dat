Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress. President Reagan raised taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility, but the overall tax burden went down during his presidency. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.|$|E

These effects have been little explored, but are potentially macro-relevant.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the direct}} impact of {{taxes on income}} {{distribution}} at the household level in Chile and estimates the distributional effect of several changes in the tax structure. We find that income distributions before and after taxes are very similar (Gini coefficients of 0. 448 and 0. 496, respectively). Moreover, radical modifications of the tax structure, such as raising the value added tax from 18 to 25 % or substituting a 20 % flat tax for the present progressive income tax affect the after-tax distribution only slightly. We present some arithmetic showing that the scope for direct income redistribution through progressivity of the tax system is rather limited. By contrast, for parameter values observed in Chile, and possibly in most developing countries, the targeting of expenditures {{and the level of}} the average tax rate are far more important determinants of income distribution after government transfers. Thus, a high-yield proportional tax can have a far bigger equalizing impact than a low-yield progressive tax.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} determinants of an asset 2 ̆ 7 s return is its liquidity-the ease with which the asset can be bought and sold. Liquid assets yield a lower return than do otherwise comparable illiquid assets. This Article demonstrates that an income tax alters the tradeoff between asset liquidity and yield because: high yields from illiquid assets are taxed; imputed transaction services income from liquidity is untaxed; and illiquidity costs are only sometimes deductible. As a result, assets have more liquidity {{and the price of}} liquidity in terms of yield is higher than {{it would be in the}} absence of an income tax. These distortions foster an excessively large financial sector, which exists in large part to create (tax-favored) liquidity. The tax wedge between liquidity and yield also creates clientele effects, in which low-rate taxpayers, such as nonprofit institutions, hold illiquid assets regardless of their liquidity needs. The liquidity/yield tax distortion also offers a new perspective on fundamental questions in federal income tax, such as the desirability of the realization requirement, preferential capital gains tax rates, and corporate taxation.

For plausible parameter values derived from data for the Norwegian economy, the deadweight loss from the tax distortions to corporate financing decisions amounts to 2 - 3 percent of total corporate tax revenue, and the socially optimal debt-asset ratio is 4 - 5 percentage points below the debt level currently observed. Driving the actual debt ratio down to this level would generate a total welfare gain of about 3 percent of corporate tax revenue.

Understanding the impact of the asymmetric tax treatment of debt and equity on the capital structures of financial institutions is critical to shaping and assessing responses to the problem of excessive leverage that underlay the 2009 financial crisis—but there is no empirical evidence to draw on.

As the model predicts, somewhat counter-intuitively, the impact of tax on hybrids is generally weak or insignificant. Responsiveness to taxation varies significantly across banks, however: those holding smaller equity buffers, and larger banks, are noticeably less sensitive to tax...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model of corporate financial structure intended to formalize the macroeconomic concern over excessive leverage. In particular, {{we attempt to}} rationalize why firms designing an optimal capital structure would choose a level of debt that leaves them heavily exposed to macroeconomic risk. Our starting point is {{a variant of the}} "corporate control" model often used to motivate debt as the optimal financial contract. We modify this framework in two ways. First, we include common risks, interpretable as business cycle risks, as well as idiosyncratic risks. Second, we include corporate and investor-level taxes, and consider the implications of a net <b>tax</b> <b>bias</b> against equity finance. The tax distortion confronts firms with a tradeoff ex ante between the costs of equity finance and the costs of increased exposure to macroeconomic risk accompanying debt finance. In this regard, an equilibrium with "excessive leverage" is possible. Further, despite the possibility of renegotiation, debt is in general less effective than equity in insulating the firm against aggregate risk. Our model leads to the prediction that individual firm dividends may vary with macroeconomic conditions, even after controlling for the effects of relevant firm-specific performance measures, such as earnings. We present some formal econometric evidence in support of this prediction, using a panel of individual corporations. Evidence on some related predictions is also presented. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a variety}} of recent papers, it is shown that {{individuals}} do not take taxes correctly into account, which results in distorted or unexpected investment behavior. We shed further light on the discussion of such behavioral tax perception biases by analyzing intrinsic and extrinsic effects on decision behavior. We study two dimensions: (1) the influence of emotions and cognition (individual dimension, intrinsic effects) and (2) the influence of available tax information by varying tax complexity and salience (tax system dimension, extrinsic effects). In our laboratory experiment, we construct the payoff structure such that the subjects are confronted with exactly the same choices in net terms in a situation {{with or without a}} capital gains tax. This design allows us to identify pure tax perception biases. We show that both dimensions are able to explain tax perception biases. In particular, we find evidence that perceived risk (cognition) is lower and consequently willingness to take risk is higher with a capital gains tax (with full loss offset provision) than without taxation. Furthermore, this positive effect on risky investment is higher in a situation with a rather low level of tax information in which tax complexity is high and tax salience is low. In addition, we are able to provide evidence that the use of decision heuristics can explain the observed <b>tax</b> <b>bias</b> differences between our information treatments.

40|$|The {{centerpiece}} of President Bush's {{tax cut in}} 2003 was a sharp reduction in the individual dividend tax rate. The dividend tax cut was designed to spur investment and boost the stock market by increasing the after-tax return on corporate earnings, thus raising stock valuations. The tax cut also reduced the <b>tax</b> <b>bias</b> against dividends to spur larger payouts to shareholders. That reduces the amount of discretionary cash available to executives and will likely {{reduce the number of}} Enron-style corporate financial scandals. This study examines the impact of the dividend tax cut after one year. We gathered data on dividend payouts before and after the 2003 tax cut for all Standard & Poor's 500 companies. We found a highly positive response to the tax cut: Annual dividends paid by S&P 500 companies rose from $ 146 billion to $ 172 billion, an increase of $ 26 billion. In addition, special dividends of $ 7 billion have been paid, raising the total first-year dividend increase to $ 33 billion. Thus, dividends increased 18 percent without special dividends and 23 percent with special dividends. Twenty-two companies that did not previously pay dividends have initiated regular dividends. Equity values rose more than $ 2 trillion after the tax cut. The large and positive response to the dividend tax cut, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2008, suggests that Congress should make it permanent...|$|E

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a simple two-sector {{model of the}} demand for housing and corporate capital. An increase in the inflation rate, with and with- out {{an increase in the}} risk premium on equities, was then simulated with a number of model variants. The model and simulation experiments illustrate both the <b>tax</b> <b>bias</b> in favor of housing (its initial average real user cost was 3 percentage points less than that for corporate capital) {{and the manner in which}} inflation magnifies it (the difference rises to 5 percentage points without an exogenous increase in real house prices and 4 percentage points with an exogenous increase). The existence of a capital-market constraint offsets the increase in the bias against corporate capital, but it introduces a sharp, inefficient reallocation of housing from less wealthy, constrained households to wealthy households who do not have gains on mortgages and are not financially const rained. Widespread usage of innovative housing finance instruments would overcome this reallocation but at the expense of corporate capital. Only a reduction in inflation or in the taxation of income from business capital will solve the problem of inefficient allocation of capital. The simulation results are also able to provide an explanation for the failure of nominal interest rates to rise by a multiple of an increase in the inflation rate in a world with taxes. When the inflation rate alone was increased, the ratio of the increases in the risk-free and inflation rates was 1. 32. An increase in the risk premium on equities, in conjunction with the increase in inflation, lowered the simulated ratio to 1. 10, introduction of a supply price elasticity of 4 and an exogenous increase in the real house price reduced the ratio to 1. 03, and incorporation of the credit-market. constraint reduced the ratio to 0. 95. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a public}} policy goal, {{moderation}} of financial instability has gained considerable prominence {{in the face of}} the recent credit contraction. Not surprisingly perhaps, the role of the tax system in exacerbating instances of financial instability has begun to receive some attention in the tax-policy literature. Consistent with the general thrust of that literature, this article explores, in a very preliminary way, how some selected tax-base rule choices line up with an explicit goal of ensuring that the tax system supports regulatory and monetary policies intended to moderate financial instability. The article frames the inquiry in terms of Hyman Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 financial instability hypothesis 2 ̆ 2 as an explanation of the sources of financial instability. Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s work suggests how excessive leverage and risk taking arise and can be seen as defensible targets informing the choice of certain tax base rules, many of which are conventionally characterized in the tax-policy literature as efficiency-reducing concessions to revenue concerns. In this respect, the article draws on tax-expenditure analysis to reconceptualize the possible design of some of these familiar income base rules whose justification is altered somewhat when framed against Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of the sources of financial instability. More particularly, the article reviews the incomplete manner in which dividend imputation systems commonly address a <b>tax</b> <b>bias</b> in favor of corporate debt, and how this incompleteness can be justified as a means to promote maintenance of margins of safety. The article also reviews the case for and design of loss limitations, as applied to financial instruments, as well as restrictions on the deduction of interest expense under the personal income tax as a form of loss limitation. No claim is made to definitively resolve any of these base design issues; nor is there a complete canvassing of all of the possible issues whose resolution is potentially affected by a focus on financial instability. The purpose of the article is the much more modest one of suggesting how standard analyses of interest deductibility and the treatment of losses might be reframed with moderation of financial instability as {{a public policy}} goal...|$|E
