40|$|Apple (Malus × domestica) leaf phenolics, in {{particular}} the three major dihydrochalcones, phloridzin, <b>trilobatin</b> and sieboldin, were studied for their potential contribution to the resistance to Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight. The constitutive phenolic compositions of part of a progeny resulting from a cross between two apple genotypes, displaying contrasted susceptibilities to fire blight, were investigated by RP–HPLC–DAD. With regards to the major dihydrochalcones, offsprings were found to display the parent profile: either phloridzin alone {{or a combination of}} phloridzin, <b>trilobatin</b> and sieboldin. Despite a strong antioxidant activity that could interfere with the oxidative burst triggered by the bacteria, sieboldin did not segregate with resistance even though it was strongly associated with a high constitutive antioxidant capacity of leaf extracts. Several hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonols were identified in the progeny but profiles were very similar. However, concentrations of several flavonols positively correlated with resistance in the genotypes that possessed <b>trilobatin</b> and sieboldin. The major dihydrochalcones that represent more than 200 mg/g of leaf DW are not directly responsible for resistance to fire blight in this system. In addition, a high constitutive antioxidant activity is unlikely to be sufficient to block bacterial spread...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of leaf extract from Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. on type II diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and the active ingredients of this effect. In addition, this study determined, for the first time, the underlying molecular and pharmacological mechanisms of the extracts on hyperglycemia using long-term double high diet-fed and streptozotocin (STZ) induced type II diabetic mice. In the present study, leaf extract, phloridzin and <b>trilobatin</b> were assessed in vivo (gavage) and in vitro (non-invasive micro-test technique, NMT) in experimental T 2 DM mice. The biochemical parameters were measured including blood glucose and blood lipid level, liver biochemical indexes, and hepatic glycogen. The relative expression of glycometabolism-related genes was detected. The effect of leaf extracts on physiological glucose flux in liver tissue from control and T 2 DM mice was also investigated. Body weight of experimental T 2 DM mice increased significantly after the first week, but stabilized over the subsequent three weeks; body weight of all other groups did not change during the four weeks' study. After four weeks, all treatment groups decreased blood glucose, and treatment with leaf extract had numerous positive effects: a) promoted in glucose uptake in liver, b) increased synthesis of liver glycogen, c) reduced oxidative stress, d) up-regulation of glucokinase (GK), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2), insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in liver, e) down-regulation of glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G- 6 -P) expression, and f) ameliorated blood lipid levels. Both treatment with <b>trilobatin</b> or phloridzin accelerated liver glycogen synthesis, decreased oxidative stress and increased expression of GK. IRS and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were both up-regulated after treatment with <b>trilobatin.</b> Expression of GLUT 2, PEPCK and G- 6 -P were also increased in liver tissue after treatment with phloridzin. Our data indicate that leaf extract from L. polystachyus Rehd. has a preferable hypoglycemic effects than <b>trilobatin</b> or phloridzin alone. Leaf extract significantly increased glucose uptake and hepatic glycogen synthesis while also inducing a decline of hepatic gluconeogenesis and oxidative stress in T 2 DM mice. From this study, we draw conclusions that L. polystachyus promoted glycogen synthesis in T 2 DM mice, and that the active compounds were not only the <b>trilobatin</b> or phloridzin...|$|E
40|$|The major {{phenolic}} compounds found in apple (Malus x domestica) {{belong to the}} class of dihydrochalcones, represented by various phloretin derivatives (e. g. phloridzin, sieboldin, <b>trilobatin).</b> Phloridzin (phloretin 2 ’-O-glucoside) and the other derivatives are found {{not only in the}} apple fruits (peel and seeds) but also in flowers, leaves, roots and bark of the entire tree. Furthermore, significant variations between genotypes and between orchards have been described. Due to the supposed health benefits of these metabolites, knowledge on biochemical and molecular level of the involved proteins/genes is of major importance to support ongoing molecular breeding programmes. The Malus germplasm collection at FEM-IASMA includes around 300 accessions which will be screened for variation in dihydrochalcone profile and content in leaves. From a preliminary screen of the metabolic profile of around 70 accessions it became apparent that three classes can be distinguished: 1. Phloridzin group, 2. <b>Trilobatin,</b> and 3. Sieboldin group. Beside some intermediates all accessions of one group are clearly characterised by the major compound belonging to one or the other group. This knowledge will not only the basis for more detailed characterisation of the biosynthetic pathway but also for isolation of different dihydrochalcones and to prepare specific extracts rich in various combinations of dihydrochalcones for in vitro studies of their function and their bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{love the}} taste of sweet foods, a craving likely due to our natural {{instinct}} to search for high calorie foods. However, obesity, diabetes {{and high blood pressure}} have become common health issues in the modern world, and therefore there is increasing demand for foods containing decreased calories and sugar levels. Fruit trees such as citrus have been bred over thousands of years to bear high sugar content fruit, and thus, while apple fruit is considered healthy for all in some respects (fiber, antioxidants), the high sugar content is a problem for a growing worldwide population suffering from "modern" diseases. One possible strategy/solution is to develop fruits to contain natural low-calorie sweeteners (e. g. dihydrochalcone), which would allow breeding for reduced fruit sugar levels while maintaining sweetness. 	Dihydrochalcone-glycosides are a family of sweet tasting naturally occurring bicyclic aromatic compounds. For instance, phloretin, a simple dihydrochalcone found in plants, is glycosylated at the 4 ' position to obtain the sweet tasting <b>trilobatin.</b> Phloretin and <b>trilobatin</b> accumulate in low levels in Malus species, in some tropical citrus species, and in a few other plants (Gosch et al., 2010). Although many of the genes and enzymes involved in polyphenol biosynthesis are known in many plant species, the specific reactions that lead to the biosynthesis of the proposed dihydrochalcone precursor, p-dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA, are unknown. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a Malus hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase, which catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of p-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA to p-dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA and dihydroferuloyl-CoA, respectively. Its apparent Km values for p-coumaroyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA and NADPH were 96. 6 µM, 92. 9 µM and 101. 3 µM, respectively. The Malus double bond reductase preferred feruloyl-CoA to p-coumaroyl-CoA as a substrate by a factor of 2. 1 when comparing catalytic efficiencies. Expression analysis of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase gene revealed that its transcript levels showed significant variation in tissues of different developmental stages, but was expressed when expected for involvement in dihydrochalcone formation. Thus, the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase appears to be responsible for the reduction of the α,β-unsaturated double bond of p-coumaroyl-CoA, the first step of dihydrochalcone biosynthesis in apple tissues, and may be involved in the production of these compound...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids, {{like other}} {{metabolites}} synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, possess {{a wide range}} of biological activities including functions in plant development and its interaction with the environment. Dihydrochalcones (mainly phloridzin, sieboldin, <b>trilobatin,</b> phloretin) represent the major flavonoid subgroup in apple green tissues. Although this class of phenolic compounds is found in very large amounts in some tissues (≈ 200 mg/g of leaf DW), their physiological significance remains unclear. In the present study, we highlight their tissue-specific localization in young growing shoots suggesting a specific role in important physiological processes, most notably in response to biotic stress. Indeed, dihydrochalcones could constitute a basal defense, in particular phloretin which exhibits a strong broad-range bactericidal and fungicidal activity. Our results also indicate that sieboldin forms complexes with iron with strong affinity, reinforcing its antioxidant properties and conferring to this dihydrochalcone a potential for iron seclusion and/or storage. The importance of localization and biochemical properties of dihydrochalcones are discussed in view of the apple tree defense strategy against both biotic and abiotic stresses...|$|E
40|$|Seven dihydrochalcone {{compounds}} {{were isolated}} from the leaves of Malus crabapples, cv. “Radiant”, and their chemical structures were elucidated by UV, IR, ESI-MS, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR analyses. These compounds, which include <b>trilobatin</b> (A 1), phloretin (A 2), 3 -hydroxyphloretin (A 3), phloretin rutinoside (A 4), phlorizin (A 5), 6 ′′-O-coumaroyl- 4 ′-O-glucopyranosylphloretin (A 6), and 3 ′′′-methoxy- 6 ′′-O-feruloy- 4 ′-O-glucopyranosyl-phloretin (A 7), all belong to the phloretin class and its derivatives. Compounds A 6 and A 7 are two new rare dihydrochalcone compounds. The results of a MTT cancer cell growth inhibition assay demonstrated that phloretin and these derivatives showed significant positive anticancer activities against several human cancer cell lines, including the A 549 human lung cancer cell line, Bel 7402 liver cancer cell line, HepG 2 human ileocecal cancer cell line, and HT- 29 human colon cancer cell line. A 7 had significant effects on all cancer cell lines, suggesting potential applications for phloretin and its derivatives. Adding a methoxyl group to phloretin dramatically increases phloretin’s anticancer activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{apple tree}} is an agriculturally and {{economically}} important tree {{commonly used in}} food and beverages. Apple has also drawn attention in recent years due to its potential pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications which are correlated with secondary metabolites. The major phenolic compounds found in apple belong to the class of dihydrochalcones, represented by various phloretin derivatives (e. g. phloridzin, sieboldin, <b>trilobatin).</b> Beside their contribution to the bitter taste of cider and the colour of apple juices due to oxidation products and they were also associated with health effects of apple fruits, and their processed products. The specific reaction {{that leads to the}} synthesis of dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA, the direct precourser of dihydrochalcones has not yet been determined. The availability of apple genomic and transcriptomic resources make apple an ideal plant to elucidate this key reductase activity that leads to the production of many valuable dihydrochalcones in apple but also in other plants. To identify genes involved in the synthesis of dihydrophenolic compounds the existing genome database of the Rosaceae was screened for apple genes with significant sequence similarity to Arabidopsis alkenal double-bond reductase. The functionally expressed apple double bond reductase exhibits p-coumaroyl-CoA reductase activity generating dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA. This finding contributes significantly to our understanding of dihydrophenol formation in plants...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids are a {{group of}} {{polyphenol}} compounds with known antioxidant activities. Among them, dihydrochalcones are mainly found in apple leaves (Malus domestica). Glycosylated dihydrochalcones were previously found in large amounts in leaves of two genotypes of Malus with contrasting resistance to fire blight, a bacterial disease caused by Erwinia amylovora. In the present study we demonstrate that soluble polyphenol patterns comprised phloridzin alone or in combination with two additional dihydrochalcones, identified as sieboldin and <b>trilobatin.</b> Presence of sieboldin in young leaves correlated well with a high 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity. Moreover, these leaves displayed enhanced tolerance to paraquat, a photooxidative-stress generating herbicide. Interestingly, phloridzin had a high activity in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, but its presence alone in leaves did not correlate with tolerance to paraquat. In order to further characterise the activity of these compounds, we tested their ability to prevent oxidative-dependent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and phenylephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat mesenteric arteries. The antioxidant capacity of sieboldin was clearly demonstrated by showing that this compound (i) prevented vasoconstriction and (ii) inhibited AGEs formation. Both assays provided interesting information concerning a potential use of sieboldin as a therapeutic. Hence, our results strongly argue for a bioactivity of dihydrochalcones as functional antioxidants in the resistance of Malus leaves to oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that sieboldin is a powerful multipotent antioxidant, effective in preventing physiopathological processes. Further work should aim at demonstrating the potential use of this compound as a therapeutic in treating free radical-involving diseases...|$|E
40|$|The major {{phenolic}} compounds found in apple (Malus x domestica) {{belong to the}} class of dihydrochalcones, represented by various phloretin derivatives (e. g. phloridzin, sieboldin, <b>trilobatin).</b> Phloridzin (phloretin 2 ’-O-glucoside) also occur beside others in strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa), cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and sweet tea (Lithocarpus polystachus), but in significant lower amounts compared to apple. Beside their contribution to the bitter taste (flavor) of cider and the colour of apple juices due to oxidation products they were also associated with health effects of apple fruits, berries and their processed products (1). Phloridzin and other derivatives are found {{not only in the}} apple fruits (peel and seeds) but also in flowers, leaves, roots and bark of the entire tree whereas in strawberry it appears to be solely accumulated in fruits. Furthermore, significant variations between genotypes in both plant species and between orchards have been described (2). However, only little is known of the function of dihydrochalcones in plant physiology. It was shown that especially phloridzin may act in plant growth or development and can inhibit bacterial and fungal growth (2). Due to the supposed health benefits of these metabolites, knowledge on biochemical and molecular level of the involved proteins/genes is of major importance to support ongoing molecular breeding programmes (FEM-IASMA). Sensitive methods (e. g. UPLC/DAD & LC-MS) for detecting/identification of natural dihydrochalcone derivatives and their metabolites in plant tissues, animal or human matrices and processed fruit products will further enable an increased dietary intake of these compounds and understanding of their mode of biofunctionality. The Malus germplasm collection at FEM-IASMA includes around 300 accessions which will be screened for variation in dihydrochalcone profile and content in leaves.

Beside their contribution to the bitter taste (flavor) of cider and the colour of apple juices due to oxidation products they were also associated with health effects of apple fruits, berries and their processed products (1). The molecular basis of the biosynthesis of dihydrochalcones has only been partially described so far. Phloretin, the aglycone structure of phloridzin is synthesized via the phenylpropanoid way. By the action of specific or also “unspecific” UPD-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) the regiospecific transfer of a sugar residue from a suitable sugar donor is achieved. Two research groups described putative UGTs involved in phloridzin biosynthesis from apple, whereas Md_PGT 1 show high substrate specificity to the chalcone producing exclusively the phloridzin (2). However, recombinant Md_UGT 71 A 15 showed broader substrate acceptance towards other flavonoids and also produces the 4 ’- and 4 -O-glucosides from phloretin in significant amounts (1). Gosch et al. (3) assumed that common chalcone synthases (CHSs) are involved in building the core structure from p-hydroxydihydrocinnamoyl-CoA (Fig. 1), which is proposed to be synthesized by an up to now unknown NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase from p-coumaroyl-CoA. In this study the formation of dihydrochalcone which should involve a double bond reductase activity is under investigation. The exact substrates and the identity of these reductases are still unclear. The extensive apple research {{and the availability of}} apple genomic and transcriptomic resources make apple an ideal plant to elucidate this key reductase activity that leads to the production of many valuable dihydrochalcones including potent nutraceuticals and sweeteners. To identify genes involved in the synthesis of dihydro-phenolic compound, like dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA in apple fruits, we screened the existing genome database of the Rosaceae for apple proteins with significant sequence similarity to Arabidopsis alkenal double-bond reductase (AKR). We show here that the functionally expressed apple double bound reductase exhibits coumaroyl-CoA reductase activity generating dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA.
