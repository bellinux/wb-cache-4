Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption <b>that</b> each <b>question</b> <b>carries</b> equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.

40|$|Scrum {{has gained}} {{surprising}} momentum as an agile IS project management approach. An obvious {{question is why}} Scrum is so useful? To answer <b>that</b> <b>question</b> we <b>carried</b> out a longitudinal study of a distributed project using Scrum. We analyzed the data using coding and categorisation and three carefully selected theoretical frameworks. Our conclusion in this paper is that Scrum is so useful because it provides effective communication {{in the form of}} boundary objects and boundary spanners, it provides effective social integration by building up social team capital, and it provides much needed control and coordination mechanisms by allowing both local and global articulation of work in the project. That is why Scrum is especially useful for distributed IS project management and teamwor...|$|R

30|$|The SF- 36 {{questionnaire}} {{was completed by}} patients from both study groups during the pre-operative visit (the same day as admission but after the first session with the psychologist), at the follow-up on day 45 and at the 4 -month follow-up after surgery. The questionnaire consists of 36 questions with multiple-choice answers which make up 8 sub-scales—‘physical functioning’, ‘role-physical’, ‘bodily pain’, ‘general health’, ‘vitality’, ‘social functioning’, ‘role-emotional’ and ‘mental health’. Each scale is converted into a scale ranging from 0 − 100, with the assumption <b>that</b> each <b>question</b> <b>carries</b> the same weight in the final total. The lower the score is, the worse the impairment and vice versa (i.e., 0 indicates the maximum impairment, while 100 indicates no impairment). It is possible to obtain two indices from these 8 sub-scales—the ‘Physical Component Summary’ (PSC) index, comprised of the first four sub-scales listed above and the ‘Mental Component Summary’ (MCS) index, comprised {{of the last four}} sub-scales. These indices represent two mathematical calculations which allow us to establish how important the physical and mental components are in the patient to determine their state of well-being [21].|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} read data in {{graphical}} forms and to interpret it by looking for general patterns or trends is an important skill in children's science education. When viewed from a procedural basis, such skills become key areas of competence in science. The framework developed by the Assessment of Performance Unit (APU) recognised the importance of reading and interpreting data as elements of a 'process' (i. e. content-independent) science curriculum. However, secondary analysis of APU performance data suggests that data manipulation should {{not be seen as}} an independent process skill, since children respond to assessment items in a number of ways, which are difficult to predict. Indeed, pupil performance on different components of the same data handling question is often very variable; indicating <b>that</b> these <b>questions</b> <b>carry</b> 'hidden' cognitive demands for pupils. It is argued that in order to tackle these hidden demands, pupils require an integrated understanding of graphical representations based on a sophisticated procedural model. Implications for changes of emphasis in science teaching and the reliability of summative assessment items are discussed in the light of these findings, since both issues impinge directly on the current National Curriculum arrangements in England and Wales...|$|R

40|$|Current paper {{describes}} {{an experience of}} cochlear implantation in elderly. Cochlear implantation has become a widely accepted intervention {{in the treatment of}} individuals with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. Cochlear implants are now accepted as a standard of care to optimize hearing and subsequent speech development in children and adults with deafness. But cochlear implantation affects not only hearing abilities, speech perception and speech production; it also has an outstanding impact on the social life, activities and self-esteem of each patient. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the cochlear implantation efficacy in elderly with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. There were 5 patients under our observation. Surgery was performed according to traditional posterior tympanotomy and cochleostomy for cochlear implant electrode insertion for all observed patients. The study was conducted in two stages: before speech processor’s activation and 3 months later. Pure tone free field audiometry was performed to each patient to assess the efficiency of cochlear implantation in dynamics. The aim of the study was also to evaluate quality of life in elderly with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss after unilateral cochlear implantation. Each patient underwent questioning with 36 Item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36). SF- 36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. The SF- 36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 - 100 scale on the assumption <b>that</b> each <b>question</b> <b>carries</b> equal weight. The eight sections are: physical functioning; physical role functioning; emotional role functioning; vitality; emotional well-being; social role functioning; bodily pain; general health perceptions.

5000|$|But to {{fear the}} {{creation}} of a domineering, illiberal officialism {{as a result of the}} studies I am here proposing is to miss altogether the principle upon which I wish most to insist. That principle is, that administration in the United States must be at all points sensitive to public opinion. A body of thoroughly trained officials serving during good behavior we must have in any case: that is a plain business necessity. But the apprehension that such a body will be anything un-American clears away the moment it is asked. What is to constitute good behavior? For <b>that</b> <b>question</b> obviously <b>carries</b> its own answer on its face. Steady, hearty allegiance to the policy of the government they serve will constitute good behavior. That policy will have no taint of officialism about it. It will not be the creation of permanent officials, but of statesmen whose responsibility to public opinion will be direct and inevitable. Bureaucracy can exist only where the whole service of the state is removed from the common political life of the people, its chiefs as well as its rank and file. Its motives, its objects, its policy, its standards, must be bureaucratic. It would be difficult to point out any examples of impudent exclusiveness and arbitrariness on the part of officials doing service under a chief of department who really served the people, as all our chiefs of departments must be made to do. It would be easy, on the other hand, to adduce other instances like that of the influence of Stein in Prussia, where the leadership of one statesman imbued with true public spirit transformed arrogant and perfunctory bureaux into public-spirited instruments of just government.|$|R

We use the knowledge <b>that</b> a <b>question</b> asks about a process, rather than a fact, to develop categories of information need implied by the questions to aid in retrieval.
