40|$|Governments usually {{try to use}} fiscal {{instruments}} to support <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children. However, {{fiscal instruments}} also affect the work effort and labour demand.

40|$|A {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is "Typology of services dealing with a care for families and their significance". <b>The</b> care for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children is currently a hot topic that affects the entire social system, from lawmakers to client families which attend NGOs. Just NGOs provide {{a large amount of}} the services dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> issues. <b>The</b> bachelor thesis theoretically and practically deals with aspects concerning services for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children. A goal of the thesis was to map <b>the</b> services for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň and České Budějovice and to compare an offer and demand for these services in chosen towns. Quantitative and qualitative research strategies were chosen to meet objectives. Through a questionnaire there were obtained data about organizations providing services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in organizations towns of České Budějovice and Plzeň for the cooperation. The basic sample for the qualitative research consisted of managers from organizations in České Budějovice and Plzeň or their representatives. A semi-standardized interview was conducted with both target groups. Before the beginning of the research I set following research questions: Does the current range of offered services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň correspond to the demand for them? Does the current offer of services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in České Budějovice correspond to the demand for those services? Is the offer of services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň greater than in České Budějovice? What kind of services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children are missing in Plzeň? What kind of services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children are missing in České Budějovice? The research showed that there are more organizations providing services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň than in České Budějovice, but the demand is greater than offer yet. The question of the offer and demand for the services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children is currently in both towns sufficient, but representatives from all organizations expressed their concern for the future in connection with a constantly increasing number of <b>the</b> client <b>families</b> compared to previous years. Results of the thesis include a typology of the services which are missing in the towns and so they can contribute to an origination of new organizations able to cover and ensure a complexity of the services for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> children in Plzeň and České Budějovice...|$|R

There are also stages of acceptance with the diagnosis of a mental disability and risk behaviour of parents these children with a mental disability as results of managing critical situation described and the related physical problems.

The intermediate target is finding out if <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> a mental disability child are more predisposed to a presence of social pathological syndromes. The theory expects following fact that the care for a mental disability child has provided by overall in majority by mothers. <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> a mental disability child incline to risk change of their behaviour than by <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> healthy child. Brothers and sisters of a mental disability child do less friendly relationships than of the healthy children. The approach to quantitative study was used at all. The strategy of questionnaire: The questionnaire inquiry was performed by <b>the</b> 20 <b>families</b> <b>with</b> healthy children and by <b>the</b> 20 <b>families</b> <b>with</b> a mental disability child.

Brothers and sisters of a mental disability child care more about their mental disability brother or sister than the elder brothers and sisters care about their younger ones. Likewise the brothers and sisters with a mental disability brother or sister have less friendly relationships than the children with healthy brothers and sisters. <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> healthy children enjoy more harmonious parental care than by <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> a mental disability child and mainly mothers do it.

5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> <b>With</b> this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>with</b> clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the {{presented}} {{paper we}} focus on the two ways in which family policy influences life of the society.
