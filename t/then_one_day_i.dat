I have a thousand vivid miniatures of it in my mind and all of them are beautiful to me, so that I could quite easily write a whole book of landscapes from the Park alone. I can still recall quite vividly the warm beauty-soaked sensation of going out into the morning sunshine of the Park, with my lunch in a little green Swiss tin under my arm and the vast interminable day all before me, the gigantic, divinely unconditional day that only boyhood knows, and the Park so great and various that it was more than two hours' going for me to reach its eastern fences. I was only a little older then than you are now. Sometimes I went right up through the woods to the house to companion with Philip and Guy Christian and their sister--I loved her <b>then,</b> and <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was to love her with all my heart--but in those boyish times I liked most to go alone.|$|R

Once a long snake hung from the mother bird's bill; once it was a bird of some kind; twice she brought small animals, whose species I could not make out in the brief moment of alighting on the nest's edge,--all these besides the regular fare of fish and frogs, of which I took no account. And <b>then,</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> while <b>I</b> lay in my hiding, I saw the mother heron slide swiftly down from the nest, make a sharp wheel over the lake, and plunge into the fringe of berry bushes on the shore after some animal that her keen eyes had caught moving. There was a swift rustling in the bushes, a blow of her wing to head off a runaway, two or three lightning thrusts of her javelin beak; then she rose heavily, taking a leveret with her; and I saw her pulling it to pieces awkwardly on the nest to feed her hungry little ones.|$|R

As in quantum mechanics and calculating the exact position of a photon, being both wave and particle, the exact meaning of a word, being both symbol and sign, changes in meaning within a given perspective.

As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work.

2500|$|In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of [...] "Mark Twain": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River <b>then,</b> and <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> wrote a {{rude and}} crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest {{steamboat}} pilot on the Mississippi River, {{and the most}} respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning {{the river and the}} changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs [...] "Mark Twain" [...] and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi." [...] The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.|$|R

It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the Hesperides ...How much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain.
