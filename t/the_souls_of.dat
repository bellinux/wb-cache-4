5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

This thesis explores what constitutes <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> medicine in a global healthcare setting by presenting stories from physicians who have practiced medicine in low-income countries.
