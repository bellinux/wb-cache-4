He railed against the use of the National Guard in the Iraq War remarking that the forces should be used to [...] "repel" [...] the [...] "invasion" [...] of illegal aliens from the southern border, and described the United Nations as [...] "a sinister organization run by Marxists, socialists and communists." [...] Baldwin criticized both major parties for not cutting spending stating that [...] "the only difference between Democrats and Republicans is Democrats want to <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> and Republicans want to borrow and spend."

2500|$|While {{the mantle}} of fiscal {{conservatism}} is most commonly claimed by Republicans and libertarians, it is also claimed in some ways by many centrist or moderate Democrats who often refer to themselves as [...] "New Democrats". Though not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan and Bush administrations, the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> philosophy held among liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that certain things needed to be cut in order to balance the federal budget. [...] Former President Bill Clinton, who was a New Democrat {{and part of the}} somewhat fiscally conservative Third Way advocating Democratic Leadership Council, {{is a prime example of}} this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations. The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during the Clinton years, the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002.|$|E
