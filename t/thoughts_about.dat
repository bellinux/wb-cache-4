5|$|Wallace {{collected}} {{more than}} 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science. One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip {{is that of the}} gliding tree frog Rhacophorus nigropalmatus, known as Wallace's flying frog. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.|$|E
5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains {{stretched across the}} river at Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that became known as Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> the guns {{to be used}} for the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as {{possible}} to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E

500|$|In September 1936, Mickal played {{quarterback for}} the Centennial College All-Stars, a team {{composed}} of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things flashed through my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> Nagurski's size. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the Nagurski legend. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> going to med school. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> possible brain damage." [...] He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II baby boom, the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and/or correspondence courses. The university rejected the idea, stating that external degree or certification programs would be significantly inferior to residence education. Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct external studies. Madgwick enthusiastically supported the idea and instructed his college's staff to begin preparing an external studies program. Heffron asked the University of Sydney if it had any objection to New England being granted independence to operate the state's external education program. The university replied {{that it had no}} objection.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, {{several of}} the staff share <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> Michael in private interviews.

When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E
