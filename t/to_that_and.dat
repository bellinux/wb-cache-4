He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E

25|$|Today, high {{technology}} {{is the foundation of}} the local economy, and there exist few remnants of the city's agricultural past. In 1990, Kevin Duggan began his position as city manager. He built a relationship with Google, Inc., and issued a long-term lease <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> other technology companies. As of 2014, those leases generate over $5 million per year in city revenue. Duggan reinstituted a special tax district for the Shoreline area, which was a landfill and pig farm in 1990. That money allowed the city to create a large park and golf course on the site. The Castro Street downtown area also benefitted from a special tax district.|$|E
25|$|The Van Diemen's Land Company {{was very}} unpopular in Hobart Town. The {{settlers}} {{felt that it}} would use all the convict labour, and be favoured by government. The company started out trying to grow wheat and barley but found the crops often ruined by heavy rain. Arthur also gave the company no favours, and it fell into financial trouble in the 1850s. The company was, however, successful in growing potatoes, finding the island's climate and soil well suited <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> oats, peas, wheat, and grass for hay to feed livestock.|$|E

Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff.

25|$|Beach's {{most famous}} {{invention}} was New York City's first subway, the Beach Pneumatic Transit. This came about during the 1860s, when traffic in New York was a nightmare, especially along the central artery, Broadway. Beach {{was one of}} a few visionaries who proposed building an underground railway under Broadway to help relieve the traffic congestion. The inspiration was the underground Metropolitan Railway in London but in contrast <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> others' proposals for New York, Beach proposed the use of trains propelled by pneumatics instead of conventional steam engines, and construction using a tunnelling shield of his invention to minimize disturbing the street.|$|E

25|$|The May 2013 {{elections}} {{were marked by}} a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. The MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and the official state media portrayed him as an individual who was planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Enrique clearly stated that they were planning a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> despite the repeated attempts of the state media to link Enrique to an illegal political party, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political parties in the country. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a censorship program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. In their censorship efforts, they would redirect all the searches performed online to the official government website.|$|E

25|$|The {{secondary}} feud {{leading into}} the event pitted The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) against Triple H and The Big Show. After defeating Stone Cold Steve Austin in a Three Stages of Hell match at No Way Out, Triple H felt that he deserved {{to be in the}} WrestleMania main event having defeated everyone in the WWF, including The Rock and Austin. The Undertaker took exception <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> told him that Triple H had never defeated him. Before WrestleMania X-Seven, the two had never faced each other in a one-on-one match on a pay-per-view event. During his entrance for a Hardcore Championship match against The Big Show, Triple H ambushed Undertaker. Kane ran in and saved the Undertaker from a further attack but was met with his own ambush by The Big Show. On the following episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker tried to break into the limousine of Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, on arrival but ended up being arrested by the police. As a result, Kane requested a match against Triple H later that night but lost when The Big Show interfered on behalf of Triple H. In retaliation, Kane interfered in The Big Show's Hardcore Championship match against Raven on Raw is War, helping Raven pin Big Show to become the new Hardcore Champion. Undertaker's arrest led to a restraining order from Stephanie. To circumvent this, the Brothers of Destruction interfered in Triple H's match against Test, with Kane ordered to run after Stephanie. With Stephanie held at ransom on a balcony in the arena, WWF commissioner William Regal gave Undertaker and Kane matches at WrestleMania against Triple H and The Big Show respectively. After being attacked during a Hardcore Championship title defense, Regal would later include Raven into Kane and Big Show's match, making it a Triple Threat Hardcore match for the Hardcore Championship.|$|E
500|$|Kuhschweizer roughly means {{literally}} [...] "Swiss cow herders"; although {{intended as}} a derogatory term, there is no connection to [...] "coward". One explanation for the violent response of the Swiss <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> related [...] "cow"-based insults is that these alluded to sodomy and thus heresy. Incidentally, the Swabians also used the term Schwyzer to denote all the Swiss, who called themselves Eidgenossen at the time, as an insult. The Swiss, however, assimilated that term and began to wear it proudly. See also Schwyz.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically.

You listen <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E

500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E

If you believe in [...] and you've got a moral conviction, take it to 'em!" [...] The rating of film later brought {{comparisons}} to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, released in theaters in a digitally altered and censored version {{just two weeks after}} South Park. Kubrick's original cut was given an NC-17 rating, but Warner Bros. then blocked out characters in an orgy scene so the film could be rated R. In response to these debates and controversy, Stone called the MPAA a [...] "bumbling, irresponsible organization".|$|E

Anderson insisted that the show both understand her situation and make accommodations: in an interview, she explained, [...] "I was determined that they respect that I would work for three weeks and then have two or three weeks off to go and be with her. So they agreed <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> that was important to me. I'd never had that before on the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown.

[...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] and I both knew [...] was much higher."

During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out." ...|$|E

[...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty in the future of a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written.
