40|$|Reproductive {{performances}} of 541 hares {{in the first}} year of production and intensively bred in four different farms were montored for three years. Results showed that the {{performances of}} the young reproducers were not influenced by the day of the birth till July. On the contrary, the hares born in August were less fertile than <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> born (14 fertile hares on 28 hares born in August vs 345 on 513 hares, born in <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>months).</b> <b>The</b> number of weaned hares produced per fertile doe was also reduced (4. 43 young hares per doe born in August vs 7 young hares per doe born in <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>months).</b> Authors conclude that no reductionof performance is linked to the selection of the doe born in the middle of the reproductive cycle. The reduction of fertility observed in the last born doe is probably more linked tothe hot temperature of this period than <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> age of <b>the</b> doe at the first delivery while the reduction of the number of weaned hares per doe per year is mainly related to the younger age...|$|R

5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E

5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> of the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win {{by a margin of}} 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution and the consequent dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>months</b> of the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in the early evening and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E

As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier platoon, receiving in its place a machine gun platoon equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft platoon was re-roled as a tank-attack platoon and the transport platoon was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received a batch of around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July it was ready to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua–Lae campaign.|$|E
