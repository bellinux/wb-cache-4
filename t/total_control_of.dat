5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is <b>total</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{fundamental}} principles <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use, the harmony theory {{was used in}} this study to develop a concept of the degree of harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use. Based on this concept, the harmoniousness <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use was analyzed in terms of the supply and demand of water resources, water resources management, water use benefits, and water-saving level. An evaluation index system of the degree of harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use was established, and a method for calculation of the degree of harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use was developed based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy comprehensive analysis (FCA) methods. The new evaluation index system was applied to a certain area in Jiangsu Province, China. The degree of harmony <b>of</b> <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water use over this area was calculated for different years. Results indicate that the evaluation index system and calculation method proposed in this study are feasible, and such a harmoniousness analysis can provide scientific references for the strict water resources management system that will be implemented in China in the near future...|$|R

5|$|Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family, Morris {{came under the}} strong {{influence}} of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded a decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, Morris assumed <b>total</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him <b>total</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in <b>total</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E

5|$|Lihau {{attended}} the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium {{with the help}} of sympathetic Jesuit educators, becoming the first Congolese to study law. While there he encouraged Congolese politicians to form an alliance that allowed them to secure the independence of the Congo from Belgium. He served briefly as a justice official and negotiator for the Congolese central government before being appointed to lead a commission to draft a permanent national constitution. He was made dean of law faculty at the University of Lovanium in 1963. The following year he helped deliver the Luluabourg Constitution to the Congolese, which was adopted by referendum. In 1965 Joseph-Desiré Mobutu seized <b>total</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the country and directed Lihau to produce a new constitution. Three years later Lihau was appointed First President of the new Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He retained the position, advocating for judicial independence, until 1975 when he refused to force a harsh sentence upon student protesters. Lihau was summarily removed from his post by Mobutu and placed under house arrest. Becoming increasingly opposed to the government, he helped found the reform-oriented Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social. Mobutu responded by suspending his rights and banishing him to a rural village.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Acid {{rain and}} {{greenhouse}} effect {{are the major}} air pollution problems in China, and the goals for the <b>total</b> emission <b>control</b> <b>of</b> NOx and <b>total</b> energy consumption <b>control</b> begin to move forward in the 12 th five-year plan. NOx emission reduction and energy saving of coal-fired power plants are still put in a strategic position. Accordingly, it is of great significance to carry out power planning work, considering effect of NOx emission index and energy saving on power industry. In this study, a mixed 0 - 1 integer linear power generation expansion model based on <b>total</b> emission <b>control</b> <b>of</b> NOx and low carbon economy effect is developed for the first time, {{which can be used}} for studying the change of power structure, confirming the releasing emissions of NOx from power system for development and reducing energy consumption by <b>total</b> amount <b>control</b> <b>of</b> power coal consumption and CO 2 emission growth rate. The model is applied to the power system in Heilongjiang province and the results indicate that the proposed model not only can meet the requirement of power generation expansion management, but also can help the power industry clear the economic impact of NOx emission reduction on self-development and achieve the energy saving target...|$|R
