5|$|The Old Bridge was so steep <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> carts had {{difficulty}} crossing it. By 1857, a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge, was built {{next to the}} Old Bridge, which was {{paid for by the}} people of Pontypridd. The Victoria Bridge is a three-arch bridge, built by Thomas Jenkins, that did not have a problem with roadway steepness.|$|E
5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} {{point out that}} it is unclear whether the stirrup was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> riders in India had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the stirrup and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and {{it can be argued that}} this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E

500|$|This {{species has}} several common names, some highly localised. Two names allude to its {{consumption}} by horses; bridle bush, a name used east of Esperance, {{refers to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>horses</b> favour it as fodder; and sweat bush, used around Hopetoun, derived from the claim <b>that</b> <b>horses</b> break out in sweat after consuming young growth. The common name of [...] flame bush derives from the brilliant red new growth. [...] It {{is also known as}} coastal jugflower. Nelson also records the use of the names Templetonia and native temp, but ridicules them as obvious errors.|$|R
5|$|The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, {{known as}} 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669. Travelling between London and Oxford by coach had {{involved}} an overnight stay at Beaconsfield, but Oxford University organised {{a project to}} allow completion of the journey between sunrise and sunset. The project succeeded, and was quickly copied by Cambridge University; {{by the end of}} Charles II's reign, in 1685, Flying Coaches ran three times a week from London to all major towns, in good conditions covering a distance of around fifty miles in a day. The Thoroughbred horse was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the General Stud Book, giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , more than the usual weight of 8–10stone (51–64kg), indicating <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars Hutt gained command of the 98-gun second rate HMS Queen, the result of patronage by Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner who had commanded Hutt in the West Indies and now personally requested him for this prestigious command. Hutt joined Gardner in the West Indies and Queen was involved in the first unsuccessful attempt to capture Martinique in 1793. A few months later, Gardner's squadron was attached to the Channel Fleet and with <b>that</b> <b>horse,</b> under Admiral Lord Howe, Queen participated in the Glorious First of June.|$|E
25|$|Viking burial rituals were {{complex and}} dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala {{describes}} the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted {{of days of}} mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces and putting them in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, {{it could not have}} solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.|$|E

25|$|Technological {{advances}} in weaving with foot-treadle floor looms {{and the use}} of scissors with pivoted blades and handles in the 13-15th century led to new designs. The upper part of dresses could now be tailored exactly to the body. Men′s dresses were buttoned on the front and women′s dresses got a décolletage. The lower part of men′s dresses were much shorter in length than those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated with an A-line so <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> riding became more comfortable. Even a knights armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many other}} women jockeys, she views the primary {{challenge}} {{to be the}} difficulty of horse racing itself. [...] She describes races as [...] "every man for himself (sic)." [...] She does not ask for any breaks from male jockeys, and has explained <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> racing is a sport where women simply have {{to be just as}} good as men. [...] She speaks well of other successful women jockeys, and expresses a lot of respect in particular for Julie Krone, to whom she is often compared. But she also said in a 2011 interview, [...] "a lot of young female riders are just girls who love horses, but they just don't have the strength and toughness, and they're not cut out to be jockeys. You've got to deliver the goods to get over that hump." ...|$|E
500|$|Florida Derby winner Royal and Regal {{had been}} {{suffering}} {{some problems with}} his feet going into the race and {{was seen as a}} horse that could potentially be scratched before the race began. Shecky Greene, Angle Light, and Royal and Regal were thought to be the only horses in the field that had [...] "appreciable early speed" [...] and would challenge to be the leader out of the gates. My Gallant was to be ridden by Angel Cordero, but Cordero was suspended for ten days starting the day of the Derby for a rules infraction on a race on May 2. Braulio Baeza was chosen to jockey My Gallant, after being dropped by the owners of Shecky Greene in advance of the race because they were unsure whether <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> would be entered into the Derby. Larry Adams was ultimately selected as the jockey for Shecky Greene. With the speed of the horses entered, many thought that course record of 2:00 would be broken.|$|E
500|$|Nagle entered The Derby in 1937; <b>that</b> <b>horse,</b> Sandsprite, ridden by John Crouch at odds of 100–1, {{finished}} second to Mid-day Sun, owned by Mrs Lettice Miller, {{the first woman}} owner ever to win the Derby. This was the first horse Nagle bred herself and reactions from commentators were mixed. One report described the horse as a [...] "commanding individual", whereas another reporter's opposing opinion was revealed by Nagle when after Sandsprite's success at Epsom she stated [...] "Not bad for a horse which one newspaper said was only good enough to give rides at the seaside". Sandsprite's dam was Wood Nymph, a mare purchased by Nagle for 240 guineas. She wanted to have her mated by the stallion Sansovino but {{had to settle for}} using his son, Sandwich, as she could not afford his stud fee. Sandsprite had several other outings in which he gained second or third placings, but was put down at the onset of his stud career after breaking a leg.|$|E
25|$|The {{domestication}} of {{the horse}} was an important step toward civilization. An increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>horses</b> were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes (Dereivka centered in Ukraine) approximately 4000-3500 BCE.|$|R

Tom Shales of The Washington Post said, [...] "Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her. It's dry and hesitant when one longs {{for it to be}} raucous and madcap." [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom. New York Post television critic Linda Stasi said the pilot lacked laughs and was so similar to The Office that [...] "it's starting to look like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing <b>that</b> <b>horse</b> up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt." [...] The pilot episode premiered in Australia on Channel Seven on December 1, 2009, when episodes from the critically acclaimed second season were already playing in the United States. Sacha Moritorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said of the episode, [...] "To be frank, tonight's premiere is weak.
