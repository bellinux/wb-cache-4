For the perfusion of the vascular system a new method was integrated into the bioreactor system that creates a physiological pulsatile medium flow between 80 and 120 mmHg to the arterial inflow of the equivalent's vascular system. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hDMECs) were injected into the vascular system of a biological vascularized scaffold based on a decellularized porcine jejunal segment and cultured in the bioreactor system for 14 days. Histological analysis and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining revealed that the hDMECs were able to recolonize the perfused vascular structures and expressed endothelial cell specific markers such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule and von Willebrand factor.

40|$|Scientists {{routinely}} {{work within}} the three R's principles of 'Reduction, Refinement and Replacement' of animal experiments. Accordingly, viable alternatives are regularly developed, and in the specific case of the human lung, in vitro models for inhalation toxicology that mimic in vivo toxic events that may occur in the human lung, are welcomed. This is especially warranted given the new EU regulations (i. e. REACH) coming into force for the handling of chemicals {{and the advent of}} nanotoxicology. Furthermore, recent advances in human tissue-engineering has made it feasible and cost effective to construct human <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalents</b> of the respiratory epithelia, as in-house models derived from primary cells. There is an urgent need for engineered <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalents</b> of the lung given the increase in pharmaceutically valuable drugs, toxicity testing of environmental pollutants and the advent of nanotoxicology. Given the well-known problems with 2 -dimensional (2 -D) cell cultures as test beds, more realistic 3 -D tissue constructs are required, especially for preclinical stages of cell- and tissue-based, high-throughput screening in drug discovery. The generation of high-fidelity engineered tissue constructs is based on the targeted interactions of organ-specific cells and intelligent biomimetic scaffolds which emulate the natural environment of their native extracellular matrix, in which the cells develop, differentiate and function. The proximal region of the human respiratory system is a critical zone to recapitulate for use as in vitro alternatives to in vivo inhalation toxicology.

40|$|A living-skin {{equivalent}} {{useful as}} a skin replacement and as a model system for basic studies has been fabricated and tested extensively, it consists of two components: (1) a dermal equivalent made up of fibroblasts in a collagen matrix that is contracted and modified by the resident cells, and (2) an epidermis that develops from keratinocytes “plated” on the dermal equivalent. A multilayered keratinizing epidermis with desmosomes, tonofliaments, and hemidesmosomes forms. Basement lamella formation occurs within 2 weeks in vitro when rat cells are used, With human cells, crypt or pseudofollicular morphogenesis is observed in vitro within 3 weeks after plating cells on the dermal equivalent. Autografts and isografts of rat-skin equivalents made with cultured cells from biopsies are rapidly vascularized, block wound contraction, and persist essentially for the lifespan of the host. Seven to 9 days after grafting, donor cells become activated biosynthetically and mitotically. By 1 year, the dermal population decreases {{to a normal level}} and the matrix has been extensively remodeled, The grafts remain free of hair and sebaceous glands. Grafts to rats have been in place for over 2 years. Now, allografts of dermal equivalents have been made across a major histocompatibility barrier and are not rejected. The persistence of cellular elements of the grafts is monitored by use of a genetic marker, Challenge of the allograft with a second skin-equivalent graft after 1 month does not result in rejection of the original graft or of the second skin-equivalent graft. We propose that allografts of <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalents</b> are tolerated because cells with class II antigens are selected against during in vitro cultivation and are excluded from the graft. Thus the fabrication of skin-equivalent tissues or of other <b>equivalent</b> <b>tissues</b> with parenchymal cells that do not bear class II antigens may render transplants of such tissues immunologically acceptable despite the presence of allogeneic cells.
