5000|$|Correspondence {{is quite}} simply when a claim {{corresponds}} with its object.

Correspondence {{is held by}} many philosophers {{to be the most}} valid of the criteria of truth. An idea which corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid definition of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this [...] "definition" [...] is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in objective reality.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2017, Politico {{reported}} Trump [...] "suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{trying to}} redraft {{the order to}} strengthen it against legal challenges." [...] The federal government also said in court filings that a new executive order is planned to be issued to addresses constitutional concerns about EO 13769. A White House official later quoted by CNN suggested the new order was being delayed, {{in part by the}} administration's expectations about the executive order's perception relative to other events in the news cycle. (Trump initially claimed the replacement order would be issued the week of February 19. On February 22 the Trump administration said the replacement order would be delayed until the following week. That week, the White House expected the order to be issued Wednesday, March 1.) According to the White House, the order has been [...] "finalized" [...] since at least February 22, although at that time agencies were still working out how to implement it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coalition}} {{asserted that}} the Deir ez-Zor bombing of Syrian troops was accidental and the U.S. [...] "relayed our regret through the Russian Federation for the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces fighting ISIL" [...] while the Syrian and Russian governments said that {{they believed that the}} strikes were intentional which led to accusations, unequivocally rejected by the U.S. and its allies, that the coalition was acting as ISIS's airforce. That day, the U.S. military {{said in a statement that}} [...] "coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit" [...] while the Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman was quoted as saying that [...] "after today’s attack on the Syrian army, we come to the terrible conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> defending the Islamic State." [...] The Syrian government released a statement saying that that the air strikes were [...] "conclusive evidence" [...] of its long held assertion that the U.S. and its allies were supporting ISIS and other jihadist groups as part of an effort to oust President Bashar al-Assad.|$|E

Media outlets allowed into the gaggle shared full details of the briefing, including their audio, with the entire press corps. Fox News [...] "joined a complaint by the chair of the five-network television pool", although their journalist was not banned. The White House Communications Agency (WHCA) lodged a complaint. Spicer explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> fighting against [...] "unfair coverage." [...] I think we're going to aggressively push back.

The President angrily refuses but the majority leader admits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> will soon have to nominate another candidate.

25|$|On April 10, 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> would seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum as part of Obama's 2014 budget proposal (the money would fund both voter education and the plebiscite itself). This next referendum {{would be the first}} Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the federal government.

5000|$|On {{a routine}} afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and {{volunteer}} for school {{functions such as}} directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's {{on his way home}} for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of [...] "nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast." [...] The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> interrupting the program: [...] "Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone." [...] At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore.|$|E
