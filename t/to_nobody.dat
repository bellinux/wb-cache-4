5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer <b>to</b> <b>nobody,</b> she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E
25|$|Cook, in his voyage up {{the east}} coast of Australia, {{observed}} no signs of agriculture or other development by its inhabitants.

Cook claimed {{the east coast}} of the continent for Britain on 23 August 1770.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Catherine {{arrived on}} Lopud {{in the second}} half of June 1463. The Ragusan authorities, {{concerned}} that harbouring the Queen might provoke an Ottoman attack on their own state, refused her entry into Dubrovnik itself until 23 July, after her father and brothers launched a successful counter-attack against the Ottomans and pushed them away from the Ragusan borders. Her widowed stepdaughter-in-law, Queen Maria, was also denied access to the Ragusan islands until July. In Dubrovnik, Queen Catherine attempted to claim the tribute of Ston, paid annually to Bosnian rulers, but the authorities declined on 20 August. Moreover, they decided that the annual rent for the use of houses and land belonging to the Bosnian royal family should be kept in their own treasury until the legal heir could be established. On 26 October, Catherine entrusted Ragusa with Thomas's silver sword, stipulating that it should be handed over to Sigismund [...] "should he ever be freed"; or else <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> but the person she would name as heir. Soon afterwards she left Dubrovnik for Slano. A reason for Ragusa's reluctance to comply with Catherine's demands may have been the reconquest of parts of Bosnia by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Ragusa's overlord, who attempted to revive the Bosnian kingdom by installing puppet kings.|$|E

2500|$|In 36 BC, Octavian and Agrippa {{set sail}} against Sextus. The fleet was badly damaged by storms {{and had to}} withdraw; Agrippa was left {{in charge of the}} second attempt. Thanks to {{superior}} technology and training, Agrippa and his men won decisive victories at Mylae and Naulochus, destroying all but seventeen of Sextus' ships and compelling most of his forces to surrender. Octavian, with his power increased, forced the triumvir Lepidus into retirement and entered Rome in triumph. Agrippa received the unprecedented honour of a naval crown decorated with the beaks of ships; as Dio remarks, this was [...] "a decoration given <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> before or since".|$|E
2500|$|The Treasure Act 1996 {{does not}} apply in Scotland. Treasure trove in Scotland is dealt with under the common law of Scotland. The general rule that governs bona vacantia ("vacant goods") – that is, objects that are lost, {{forgotten}} or abandoned – is quod nullius est fit domini regis ("that which belongs <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> becomes our Lord the King's [...] "), and the law of treasure trove is a specialized application of that rule. As in England, the Crown in Scotland has a prerogative right to treasure trove for {{it is one of}} the regalia minora ("minor things of the King"), that is, property rights which the Crown may exercise as it pleases and which it may alienate (transfer to another party).|$|E

2500|$|Widlar {{was a hard}} {{person to}} work with, but the few {{men and women who}} could, like Talbert and Jack Gifford, joined his inner circle for life. Widlar and Talbert closely guarded their trade secrets and kept {{unwanted}} co-workers out of the loop. Gifford, one of those accepted by Widlar and Talbert, said that Widlar [...] "would almost talk <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> and he would only talk to me on, you know, if I could get him in the right mood. And he was still secretive as hell". Talbert pushed Widlar's experimental orders through his plant at top speed, saving his partner four weeks on every batch {{at the expense of other}} orders. Fairchild executive Don Valentine said in 2004: [...] "This was a phenomenal duo of highly eccentric — or whatever the word is beyond eccentric — individuals". Former Fairchild photographer Richard Steinheimer said in 1995: [...] "Talbert handling the fabrication and Widlar handling the design, they ruled the world and led the world in linear integrated circuits for a couple of decades." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his seminar {{delivered}} at the Leveson Inquiry, Dacre re-asserted his opinion that self-regulation [...] "in a considerably beefed up form" [...] remained [...] "the only viable way of policing a genuinely free press". He was critical of Cameron ("too close to News International") who [...] "in a pretty cynical act of political expediency has prejudiced {{the outcome of this}} inquiry by declaring that the" [...] Press Complaints Commission, [...] "an institution he'd been committed to only a few weeks previously, was a 'failed' body". Dacre claimed legislation passed in the last 20 years already helped stop necessary journalistic enquiry, and meant that the press was [...] "already on the very cusp of being over regulated". After returning to his negative opinion of liberals, who [...] "by and large hate all the popular press", he said [...] "that Britain's commercially viable free press – because it is in hock <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> – is the only really free media in this country." [...] His advocacy of newspaper owners being legally unable to reject any regulatory body was viewed as a reference to Richard Desmond, whose Northern & Shell company owns the Daily Express, and had withdrawn from the PCC.|$|E
2500|$|Jacob Brackman {{introduced}} fellow producer Bert Schneider to Terrence Malick in 1975. On {{a trip to}} Cuba, Schneider and Malick began {{conversations that}} would lead to the development of Days of Heaven. Malick had tried and failed to get Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino to star in the film. Schneider agreed to produce the film. He and Malick cast young actors Richard Gere and Brooke Adams and actor/playwright Sam Shepard for the lead roles. Paramount Pictures CEO at the time Barry Diller wanted Schneider to produce films for him and agreed to finance Days of Heaven. At the time, the studio was heading in a new direction. They were hiring new production heads who had worked in network television, and, according to former production chief Richard Sylbert, [...] " [...] product aimed at your knees". Despite the change in direction, Schneider was able to secure a deal with Paramount by guaranteeing the budget and taking personal responsibility for all overages. [...] "Those were the kind of deals I liked to make ... because then I could have final cut and not talk <b>to</b> <b>nobody</b> about why we're gonna use this person instead of that person", Schneider said.|$|E
