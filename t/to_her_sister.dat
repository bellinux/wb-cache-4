5|$|As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories {{which she}} {{frequently}} read <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister.</b> Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, {{where her mother}} worked in the science department. When {{she was a young}} teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.|$|E
5|$|As most of {{the songs}} are {{in the form of}} Ovee, Ranade decided to use the {{traditional}} musical format. He took help of Sarojini Babar, a Marathi writer-politician who had studied the songs of the period depicted in the film. Babar introduced Ranade <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Kumud Pawar, who have made a collection of various traditional Ovee. For two situation songs, Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Knowles {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Motown girl groups and says that her first passion is songwriting. She is frequently compared by the media <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Beyoncé, but Solange insists they have different aspirations and are musically different. Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with Rimmel London and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children. On November 16, 2014, Knowles married music video director Alan Ferguson in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Odell Waller {{was born}} in 1917 to Dollie Jones and an unknown father, who died shortly after his birth. Jones gave the boy <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Annie Waller and Annie's husband, Willis Waller, to adopt, and Odell {{considered}} Annie his mother. Odell completed three years of high school, but was later forced to leave school {{to work on the}} farm. From 1935 to 1938, he was convicted of seven offenses, including assault, reckless driving, bootlegging, and carrying a concealed razor. In January 1939, he married a woman named Mollie.|$|E
5|$|The series' 2011 reboot {{made her}} even more psychologically unstable, not to mention cannibalistic, and her {{resemblance}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> has greatly diminished. In the backstory of Mortal Kombat X, Mileena is the sole surviving heir of Shao Kahn and vies for the Outworld throne with the warlord Kotal Kahn. Despite conflicting messages from the dualism of her design, leading to some negative criticism, Mileena has had mostly positive reception from fans and critics alike.|$|E

She subsequently lost to former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the next round, having led 5–2 in the final set. Robson then made her debut at the Italian Open where she defeated Venus Williams in the first round but subsequently lost <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> world No. 1 and eventual champion Serena Williams in the second round. At the French Open Robson was beaten in the first round by former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{spent her}} last years at Kensington Palace, occupying rooms next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Princess Beatrice. She made {{occasional}} public appearances with the royal family, {{such as at}} the Cenotaph at Whitehall on 11 November 1925. However, her health deteriorated. In 1935, she greeted her nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, her great nephew, King Edward VIII, abdicated on 11 December 1936. In December 1936, Louise wrote to the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, sympathising with him about the crisis.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States, Urey received an offer of a National Research Council fellowship to Harvard University, and also received an offer to be a research associate at Johns Hopkins University. He chose the latter. Before taking up the job, he traveled to Seattle, Washington, to visit his mother. On the way, he stopped by Everett, Washington, where he knew a woman called Kate Daum. Kate introduced Urey <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Frieda. Urey and Frieda soon became engaged. They were married at her father's house in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1926. The couple had four children: Gertrude Bessie (Elisabeth), born in 1927; Frieda Rebecca, born in 1929; Mary Alice, born in 1934; and John Clayton Urey, born in 1939.|$|E

5|$|This {{park was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} official joining of Ikata <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>Sister</b> City of Red Wing, Minnesota, after which it is named. Of note is the 21-meter stainless-steel monument located {{at the entrance of}} the park, a twin sister of the one in Bay Point Park, Red Wing. Beneath the monument lies a commemorative stone plaque bearing the signatures of each of the mayors at the time. It is home to Adventure Hill—a playground full of climbing nets, roller slides, and other children's play equipment. The park is free and open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> who was now the Tsarina.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5|$|In March 1901 the {{battleship}} grounded again, {{this time in}} the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the Maine. Another accident happened in August of that year, when Massachusetts grounded on a rock in Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard Massachusetts: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken gasket caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906 {{the battleship}} was decommissioned and her crew was transferred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> ship Indiana, which had completed a three-year modernization. Massachusetts now received the same upgrades, including twelve 3"/50 caliber gun single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock & Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a lattice mast and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.|$|E
5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister,</b> Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{began the}} season by {{reaching}} the final at the Medibank International in Sydney, losing to world No. 1 Henin {{in the final}} set. At the Australian Open, Kuznetsova was seeded second, but fell {{in the third round}} to 29th seed Agnieszka Radwańska. After her defeat at the Qatar Open to 15th seeded Sybille Bammer, she fell after 15 weeks to No. 3 on 25 February. Kuznetsova made her second final of the season in Dubai, defeating former world No. 1 Mauresmo in the quarterfinals and world No. 4 Janković in the semifinals. In the final Kuznetsova lost to Elena Dementieva. At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in March, Kuznetsova defeated Radwańska in the quarterfinals before defeating Australian Open champion Sharapova in the semifinals. In the final, Kuznetsova lost to top-seeded Ivanović. This marked her eighth defeat in her nine most recent final appearances. At the Tier I Sony Ericsson Open the next fortnight, Kuznetsova defeated Venus Williams in the quarterfinals but then lost <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> Serena in the semifinals.|$|E
50|$|His 1981 book Outside Over There is {{the story}} of a girl, Ida, and her sibling jealousy and responsibility. Her father is away and so Ida is left <b>to</b> watch <b>her</b> baby <b>sister,</b> much <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dismay. <b>Her</b> <b>sister</b> is kidnapped by goblins and Ida must go off on a magical {{adventure}} <b>to</b> rescue <b>her.</b> At first, she is not really eager <b>to</b> get <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> and nearly passes <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> right by when she becomes absorbed in the magic of the quest.

5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1945, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, {{commander}} of the BPF, came aboard and addressed the crew. Indefatigable continued flying operations until she entered Sagami Bay on 5 September. She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney. The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November. On 1 November, Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship. She became Vian's flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag. She arrived in Wellington on 27 November and was opened for public tours, during which time the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, also visited. Indefatigable then sailed to Auckland, arriving on 12 December, and was again opened for tours. She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited Melbourne on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later. Vian transferred his flag <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> ship Implacable that day and the ship stopped off at Fremantle and Cape Town en route. While Indefatigable was visiting the latter city, she was opened to the public, and the Governor-General of South Africa toured the ship.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig had her {{anti-aircraft}} armament modernized {{to bring}} her closer to the standard of weaponry fitted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister.</b> After 1934, two additional 8.8cm guns were added, with another pair later. Starting in 1941, eight 3.7cm guns were installed, along with fourteen 2cm guns. After 1944, she only carried eight of the 2cm guns. Nürnbergs anti-aircraft battery was improved {{over the course of}} World War II. In late 1942, a pair of Army-variant 2cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed, one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret. In May 1944, the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns, but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses, and only two guns were installed. One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located. Two Navy-pattern Flakvierlings were added; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret, and the other was placed in front of the anti-aircraft fire director. The Army-pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck. In December 1944, another revised anti-aircraft plan was proposed, this time incorporating the new 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun, of which there were to be eight, along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2cm twin mounts. Germany's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made, however.|$|E
