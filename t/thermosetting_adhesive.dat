40|$|Abstract—All {{plastics}} can {{be divided}} into two groups called thermoplastics and thermosets, and each group exhibits very different behaviors. Unlike thermosets, thermoplastics are em-pirically known by the viscoelastic behavior of the thermoplastic layers; the stress generated by building subsequent layers can be significantly relieved in a multilayer structure. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the stress relaxationf effect of thermoplastics in lamination-based multilayer substrates. As an increasing number of layers were laminated using either ther-moplastic or <b>thermoset</b> <b>adhesives,</b> the maximum bow values were measured layer-by-layer using a laser profilometry during thermal cycling. When analyzed through an analytical model, the measured thermal behavior of thermoplastics exhibited as much as 70 % stress relaxation in the multilayer structures, and highly contrasted with that of <b>thermoset</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The result provides an important design guideline that thermoplastics {{can be used as a}} stress relaxation layer in lamination-based multilayer substrates.

Three laboratory accelerated ageing processes were applied to single lap joints (SLJs) of two polypropylene substrates in order to replicate the least favourable environmental conditions in automotive usage. Experimental parametric studies were performed on virgin and aged specimens,investigating the influence of two design factors, the overlap length and adhesive layer thickness,on the load carrying capacity and mode of failure of the SLJ. FT-IR was used to perform qualitative HMA polymer composition analyses. The DSC test was also performed to obtain the thermal behaviour,and the phase transition temperatures of the HMA. In addition,the sliding temperature test was performed in an electronically controlled climatic chamber to understand, by means of tests on SLJs, the temperature resistance of the HMA/polypropylene bonded systems.

These experiments yielded a set of values and macroscopic failure features which was different from the case where instead of the adhesive thermosetting resin, the same area was occupied by a solid lubricant. The investigation was further extended for a third case where a hybrid interface involving two onethird ends with thermosetting resin while middle one-third had solid lubricant material within it.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} a ternary <b>thermosetting</b> <b>adhesive</b> which consists of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) epoxy resin cured with 3, 3 ’-diamino diphenyl sulphone (3, 3 ’-DDS) hardener and modified through the addition of carboxyl- terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Processing implications of the novel adhesive in the film form are considered in order to manufacture bonded specimens for characterisation of the adhesive performance in structural joints. The ternary blend which represents the novel adhesive formulation is also characterised in bulk form. The cure kinetics behaviour of the novel ternary blend is investigated using differential scanning calorimetry which shows 10 % reduction in the total reactivity, and therefore reduced final crosslinking density, {{with the addition of}} the carbon nanotubes. A cure kinetics model is developed for the novel ternary thermoset. From characterisation of cast samples, a toughening effect of the phase separated rubber particles is observed, from 144 to 317 J/m 2, with a further increase to 551 J/m 2 {{in the presence of the}} carbon nanotubes. In the absence of rubber, the nanotubes alone produce a minimal effect upon the thermo-mechanical and mechanical characteristics of the resin. The morphology of the cured material is affected by the presence of the nanoparticles, resulting in the reduction of the mean rubber particle size from 3 µm to below 1 µm. The electrical conductivity of the cured resin samples is found to increase by six orders of magnitude, up to 3. 6 x 10 - 3 S/m in the ternary blend for a low carbon nanotube concentration of 0. 3 wt%. DCB and ELS tests are used to study the performance of the novel adhesive in a joint configuration. The adhesive joint strength is dependent on the substrate type as well as on the surface preparation. The novel adhesive is also examined under fatigue in a ‘bonded crack retarder’ application.

Variable frequency microwave processing appeared to yield a slight reduction in the required adhesive cure time when compared to processing by the application of single frequency microwave radiation. In contrast to the single frequency processing, the variable frequency methodology does not readily produce localized overheating (burnt or brown spots) in the adhesive or the composite.

However, such excellent physical attributes pose a significant challenge with respect to disassembly of the bonded adherends and previous disassembly methods have resulted in damage to the adherends. Hence, this paper presents a specifically engineered re-workable nanocomposite adhesive, created by embedding dielectric sensitive Fe 3 O 4 hollow nanospheres (HNSs) in epoxy resin. This nanocomposite adhesive can be completely degraded by dielectric heating, resulting in facile disassembly of bonded adherends. FESEM and 3 D Micro-CT characterisation demonstrates good dispersibility of the HNSs in cured ER, while the dielectric degradation performance and hardness/modulus were investigated by FESEM and nanoindentation. Results show that the Fe 3 O 4 HNSs can effectively convert the microwave energy into thermal energy to significantly degrade the mechanical properties of the adhesive modulus and hardness by 83. 4 % and 90 %, respectively. FESEM and HRTEM imaging attributes the reduction in nanocomposite adhesive properties to the formation of spatial voids nucleating from the embedded nanomaterials.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Bonding {{kinetics}} of <b>thermosetting</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{plays an}} important role within wood based composites during hot pressing, and in determining appropriate processing schedules for the manufacture of composites. A dynamic method has been developed to offer a direct means for investigating physical transformations that occur during bond formation, and the influence that temperature and moisture content together have on this process. Environments for each test are maintained constant and uniform throughout the cross-section of the wood-adhesive combination by injecting selected atmospheres of the appropriate temperature and relative humidity into the sealed pressing system. Desired bond forming conditions are therefore maintained near constant within the system. Many bonds have been formed under a range of steady-state temperatures and moisture contents and immediately tested in tensile mode after a range of forming times. New instrumentation has been developed which is enabling the development of bond strength to be analyzed fundamentally and quantitatively while varying these parameters. Because the factors involved in hot pressing wood based composites are so interactive, this numerical data linking temperature and moisture content to strength development rates during the formation of test bonds is necessary. This is in order to understand haw the conditions that occur in composites during pressing effect bonding.

40|$|AbstractAdhesive bonding {{technology}} is a promising alternative to traditional joining techniques. Indeed, bonded joint shows higher strength and fatigue life than bolted or riveted joints having identical weight. However, bonded joints are sometime reputed to be little reliable since significant dispersion could be observed while measuring their strength but also due to strong sensitivity to adhesion defect and poor surface preparation. Damage tolerance philosophy is now recommended for more reliable design of critical bonded parts by precise prediction of decohesion initiation and propagation along the bondline. Double cantilever beam (DCB) test {{is the most popular}} method to characterize the decohesion resistance of bonded interface by measuring their fracture energy or their R-curve in case significant nonlinear behaviour is observed. These past years, several efficient analysis techniques have been proposed to evaluate the fracture energy but also some optimization techniques to identify more complex interface behaviour. However, most of these techniques consider non time dependent behaviour while <b>thermoset</b> <b>adhesives</b> are known to be viscoelastic and in some condition can also show viscoplastic behaviour. Such effects are important to evaluate when bonded joint sustain stationary loads since they could lead to delayed fracture and slow crack growth. In the present work, we evidence some strain rate sensitivity at the bondline scale by performing DCB test under different opening rate conditions. At first, the viscoelastic behaviour of the adhesive is studied by performing creep test in a Dynamic Mechanical Analyser. The DCB tests results are interpreted with several methods including the Simple Beam Theory.
