5|$|According to the 2011 census, {{more than}} 87percent of {{residents}} spoke English {{as a first}} language. Nearly 2percent spoke German; just over 1percent each spoke Spanish, Dutch, or French; and almost 1percent each spoke Chinese (unspecified), Tagalog, Polish, or Hungarian <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language.</b> The next most commonly spoken languages were Japanese, Italian, Ukrainian, Nepali, Cantonese, Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|More than 99 {{percent of}} the {{population}} speaks Japanese as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language.</b> Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} (74.5%) of Chinese Filipinos speak either Filipino or English as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>languages.</b> The majority of Chinese Filipinos (77%) still retain {{the ability to}} understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.|$|R
5|$|Bahasa Malaysia is the {{principal}} language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language.</b> It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. Another major dialect spoken is Hakka. While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken include Telugu, Malayalam, Punjabi and Hindi. Beside the Malay language, {{there are a variety}} of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau and Javanese.|$|E
5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language</b> or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language.</b> But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language.</b> As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E
50|$|First Nations and Inuit {{people from}} Northern Canada speak {{a version of}} Canadian English {{influenced}} by the phonology of <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>languages.</b> European Canadians in these regions are relatively recent arrivals, and have not produced a dialect that is distinct from southern Canadian English.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of China as a regional power in the late 1990s, speaking Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese varieties was seen as old-fashioned and awkward, with the younger generation of Chinese Filipinos opting to use either English, Filipino or various other regional <b>languages</b> as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Verbs or {{adjectives}} {{from other}} languages often have English affixes, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language's syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>languages</b> into English, for instance, [...] "on the light" [...] instead of [...] "turn on the light". Or sometimes, [...] "open the light", translated directly from Chinese.|$|R
5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A growing number of people believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as {{only a small percentage of}} the country use Swedish as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>language</b> and that a large number of government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{concepts}} {{have also}} been influential in the speculation about the processes of building internal systems of second-language information. Some thinkers hold that language processing handles distinct types of knowledge. For instance, one component of the Monitor Model, propounded by Krashen, posits a distinction between “acquisition” and “learning.” According to Krashen, L2 acquisition is a subconscious process of incidentally “picking up” a language, as children do when becoming proficient in <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>languages.</b> Language learning, on the other hand, is studying, consciously and intentionally, the features of a language, as is common in traditional classrooms. Krashen sees these two processes as fundamentally different, {{with little or no}} interface between them. In common with connectionism, Krashen sees input as essential to language acquisition.|$|R
