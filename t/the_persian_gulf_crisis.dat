5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates whether {{firms that}} expect {{increases}} in earnings resulting from sudden product price increases use accounting accruals to reduce earnings and, thus, political sensitivity. Specifically, oil firms' accruals are analyzed {{in a period}} of rapid gasoline price increases during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> Our results show that oil firms that expected to profit from the crisis used accruals to reduce their reported quarterly earnings during the <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> In contrast to previous research, we find that the tendency to release good earnings news early, documented in prior research, is reversed for oil firms during the <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> This finding suggests that the benefit of disclosing "good news" (i. e., earnings increases) early may have been outweighed by the political costs associated with timely releases of the information...|$|R
5000|$|The {{supply of}} oil is {{dependent}} on geological discovery, the legal and tax framework for oil extraction, the cost of extraction, the availability and cost of technology for extraction, and the political situation in oil-producing countries. Both domestic political instability in oil producing countries and conflicts with other countries can destabilise the oil price. In 2008 the New York Times reported, for example, in the 1940s {{the price of oil}} was about $17 rising to just over $20 during the Korean War (1951-1953). During the Vietnam War (1950s1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20. During the Arab oil embargo of 1973—the first oil shock—the price of oil rapidly rose to double in price. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution the price of oil rose. During the second oil shock the price of oil peaked in April 1980 at $103.76. During the 1980s there was a period of [...] "conservation and insulation efforts" [...] and the price of oil dropped slowly to [...] It again reached a peak of c. $65 during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> and war.

40|$|Since {{the very}} first {{beginnings}} of American popular culture, just about every other race or culture-"other" generally referring to all those outside of the category of White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, Americans-has {{at one point or}} another fallen victim to being stereotyped. This study is an attempt to explore some of the easily recognizable and prevalent stereotypes that have been widely circulated by America's popular culture. By doing so, it is hoped that this study will serve to enhance a greater awareness of the existence of stereotypes as well as to reveal some of the possible causes and potentially powerful effects. Most recently, over the course of <b>the</b> recent <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> War <b>Crisis,</b> when our nation was forced to focus on the Middle East and the Arabs who inhabit it, it became painfully apparent that there are complex people and unique cultures that actually exist beyond and outside the narrow-minded, one dimensional parameters of the Arab stereotype. Yet, once Kuwait was liberated and American troops started returning home from the gulf, America was left with the indelible impression that all Arabs are nothing more than irrational, violent, uncivilized, and untrustworthy inhabitants of a politically and economically important desert. Theoretically then, a seemingly simple question such as, "What actually 'is' an Arab?" goes insufficiently and unfairly answered since most people know so little about Arabs and what is known is hardly related to reality. The knowledge most readily available is oftentimes limited to generalized, biased, and possibly distorted or inaccurate stereotypes portrayed and perpetuated by pop culture...|$|R
