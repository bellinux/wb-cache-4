500|$|James Allen, an Atlanta {{antiques}} collector, {{spent years}} looking for postcards of lynchings for his Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America (2000). [...] "Hundreds of flea markets later," [...] he wrote, [...] "a trader pulled me aside and in conspiratorial tones offered <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me</b> a real photo postcard. It was Laura Nelson {{hanging from a}} bridge, caught so pitiful and tattered and beyond retrieving—like a paper kite sagged on a utility wire." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me,</b> but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|BBC {{reported}} on 13 January 2009 that Manchester City made {{a bid for}} Kaká for over £100million. Milan Director Umberto Gandini replied that Milan would only discuss the matter if Kaká and Manchester City agreed to personal terms. Kaká initially responded by telling reporters he wanted to [...] "grow old" [...] at Milan and dreamed of captaining the club one day, but later said, [...] "If Milan want <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me,</b> I'll sit down and talk. I can say {{that as long as}} the club don't want <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me,</b> I'll definitely stay." [...] On 19 January, Silvio Berlusconi announced that Manchester City had officially ended their bid after a discussion between the clubs, and that Kaká would remain with Milan. Milan supporters had protested outside the club headquarters earlier that evening, and later chanted outside Kaká's home, where he saluted them by flashing his jersey outside a window. Kaká finished his final season with Milan by scoring 16 goals, helping Milan finish third in Serie A, and once again being elected as a finalist for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award, finishing fourth in voting for the second-straight year. He was also nominated for the Ballon D'Or award, finishing in sixth place, and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} the spectators stare at him in surprise, and, {{wondering}} if {{he had lost his}} senses, settled myself to listen as the storekeeper deposed <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> <b>me</b> oil of the description mentioned, adding reluctantly that very few others took the same size of can. This, and a lengthy speech, closed the prosecutor's case, and it seemed, when he had finished, that nothing short of a miracle could save me. The audience was also evidently of the same opinion.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to his mother from prison, Rudolph has written, [...] "Many good people {{continue}} to send me money and books. Most of them have, of course, an agenda; mostly born-again Christians looking to save my soul. I suppose the assumption is made that because I'm in here I must be a 'sinner' in need of salvation, and they would be glad <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me</b> a ticket to heaven, hawking this salvation like peanuts at a ballgame. I do appreciate their charity, but I could really do without the condescension. They have been so nice I would hate to break it to them that I really prefer Nietzsche to the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1973, Ajax players {{voted for}} Piet Keizer {{to be the}} team's captain in a secret ballot, ahead of Cruyff. And Cruyff decided his time in Amsterdam {{had come to an}} end. He joined Barcelona just weeks later, two years before the Spanish {{dictator}} Francisco Franco died, maintaining to the European press corps en route that he chose Barcelona over rivals Real Madrid because he could never join a club [...] "associated with Franco". As he recalled in a documentary on TV3 channel, [...] "I remember my move to Spain was quite controversial. (...) The president of Ajax wanted <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>me</b> to Real Madrid, (...) Barcelona weren't at the same level as Madrid football wise, but it was a challenge to play for a Catalan club. Barcelona was more than a club." [...] At the end of the 1982–83 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff and he responded by signing for Ajax's archrivals Feyenoord. Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie {{for the first time in}} a decade, part of a league and KNVB Cup double.|$|E

60|$|I had {{my choice}} between {{doing this and}} {{watching}} the late boatmen at their dinner in the distance. No doubt moods have an aesthetic conscience of their own,--they demand appropriate setting; for I was annoyed at the hilarity of these men over their midday meal.

50|$|In the Sunday food {{section of}} the Minneapolis Star and Tribune (December 1, 1974 issue), food editor Mary Hart {{featured}} Lansky and the cookbook. This inspired Lansky and her husband Bruce, who had worked in sales and marketing, to start a publishing company. Meadowbrook Press (named after Meadowbrook Lane where the couple lived) was created <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Feed <b>Me</b> I'm Yours nationally. When the couple's marriage ended in the early 1980s, however, so did the business partnership; in the divorce settlement, her husband got the business, while she got their lake-front home.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{took out}} a map, to show {{me some of the}} places at which he had had adventures. I said that the thing was curious, and would buy it of him, if he was {{disposed}} <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> He said that it would be as much as his life were worth to part with it, to an Englishman; and, indeed, that it was only captains of ships trading in those seas who were allowed to have them, seeing that all matters connected with the islands were held as a state secret. After some trouble and chaffering, however, he agreed to make me an exact copy, and <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it <b>me</b> for ten gold pieces.|$|R

[...] "George {{is not very}} fond of Isleworth--in fact, he rather dislikes it; but, like all the Caresfoots, he does not care about parting with landed property, and, though we appear to be good friends, he hates me too much ever to consent, under ordinary circumstances, <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It is to you I look to overcome that objection." ...|$|R
2500|$|With Ben-Menashe's claims {{remaining}} in the public eye, in early 1991 The New Republics Steven Emerson travelled to Israel, and on his return described Ben-Menashe as merely a [...] "low-level translator", even though the references described Ben-Menashe as working in [...] "key positions" [...] and handling [...] "complex and sensitive assignments." [...] Parry later wrote that other documents confirmed Ben-Menashe's travels: [...] "Ben-Menashe's passports and other documents revealed that he had traveled extensively with frequent trips to Latin America, Eastern Europe, the United States and elsewhere, not exactly {{the record of the}} stay-at-home, low-level translator that Israel was trying <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and other journalists." [...] Emerson also published his claims in other outlets, and Newsweek (which Parry had left in June 1990) also attacked Ben-Menashe. In 1992, however, Moshe Hebroni, the deputy director of the Military Intelligence Directorate, told Craig Unger that Ben-Menashe had worked directly with him and had access to sensitive material. Additionally, in the Israeli daily Davar, reporter Pazit Ravina wrote that [...] "in talks with people who worked with Ben-Menashe, the claim that he had access to highly sensitive intelligence information was confirmed again and again." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1931 Ernest Maggs had {{travelled}} to the Soviet Union with a colleague, Maurice Ettinghausen, who {{was both}} a bookseller and a scholar. When they saw the priceless Codex Sinaiticus, Ettinghausen remarked to his hosts, “If you ever want <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it, let <b>me</b> know." [...] Some time later, Maggs received a postcard saying that the Soviet government would be prepared <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Codex Sinaiticus for £200,000. The British group offered £40,000; finally, a price of £100,000 was agreed upon, an enormous sum and the highest price ever paid for a book at the time.

And when they finally realized that it was actually a jazz record, that it wasn't going to be worth mega-bucks to them, they agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> which took a few more months to negotiate. Once I got possession of the album, I had to shop for a new deal, which took another seven months." ...|$|R
