40|$|ABSTRACT. This study evaluates runoff {{predictions}} {{generated by}} GeoWEPP (Geo-spatial interface to the Water Erosion Prediction Project) and {{a modified version}} of WEPP v 98. 4 for forest soils. Three small (2 to 9 ha) watersheds in the mountains of the interior Northwest were monitored for several years following timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed climate variables, percent ground cover, soil erodibility values, and GIS-derived slope data were used to drive the models. Predictions of <b>total</b> yearly <b>runoff</b> generated by GeoWEPP (WEPP v 2002. 7) and the modified WEPP model were compared to <b>total</b> yearly <b>runoff</b> measured at each watershed. In addition, measured seasonal values were compared to the predictions generated by the modified WEPP model. GeoWEPP significantly underpredicted the <b>total</b> yearly <b>runoff</b> for all three sites. The modified WEPP model, with algorithm changes to account for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow, predicted <b>total</b> yearly <b>runoff</b> for two of the three sites with an index of agreement (d) of 0. 8 and 0. 9 for each. The third site performed less accurately, with d = 0. 3. In the seasonal runoff predictions, the modified WEPP model was most accurate for the spring months (higher runoff) but was a poor predictor for other seasons when the measured runoff rates were low. The GeoWEPP model successfully incorporates digital elevation data, but the WEPP version used to process the data does not adequately represent the hydrological processes of forests. The lateral flow modifications that were added to the WEPP model improved predictions of runoff in forests, thus suggesting that further refinement of these calculations may improve the accuracy of WEPP-based models when applied to forest environments...|$|R

40|$|Hydrological {{models are}} {{important}} to help us understanding processes, i. e. processes that are underlying the physical catchment structure and governing the water movement. Different types of hydrological models have been developed in the past. Catchments may be modelled by lumped rainfall-runoff models using basin average input data and producing <b>total</b> basin <b>runoff.</b> These models provide quick and reasonable results of the runoff behaviour. However, as these models are based on conceptual representations of the physical processes of the water flow lumped over the entire catchment area; they cannot be expected to accurately represent the catchment condition. In this climate change impact study, in which the complete catchment hydrological system is important, more physically realistic distributed models form an alternative to model the hydrological behaviour. These kinds of models maintain the physical background {{because of the high}} level of detail and include the distributed nature of hydrological properties like soil type, slope and land-use. In this study two distributed models, MIKE SHE and WetSpa, were applied to the hydrologic system of the Grote Nete-Grote Laak in order to assess the impacts of climate change. The models have been developed based on a common dataset, and calibrated, with a focus on low flows. Special emphasis was put upon the low flow hydrology as the climate scenarios for Belgium points towards drier conditions during summertime. The objective of the study was twofold. A first objective is to evaluate the applicability of the MIKE SHE and WetSpa distributed models to a Belgian case study. How well do these models capture the hydrological behaviour of the system? Processes that are included in the models and that lead to the resulting output are analysed to disentangle their role in controlling high and low flows. Secondly, the models are used to assess the impact due to climate change. Changes in <b>runoff</b> <b>totals,</b> <b>runoff</b> regimes and extreme values - in particular low flows - are analysed.

40|$|AbstractIf {{it comes}} to the {{advantages}} of conservation tillage practices, a considerable amount of evidence supports positive effects towards reduction of surface runoff and soil erosion. However studies concerning arable land frequently are conducted under ideal laboratory conditions or “controlled” field conditions, meaning that the experimental approaches were not managed by farmers in the way they usually perform conservation tillage but managed towards an optimisation of the tested features. In addition, applicability of different existing conservation tillage techniques such as no tillage or mulching may be regionally different. The alpine forelands of Central Europe are dominated by small scale farming systems which frequently have limited access to special machinery which is needed to successfully implement no tillage treatments. We therefore carried out rainfall simulation experiments employing conservation tillage practices to test the effectiveness of actual real life conservation tillage methods under conditions prevailing in the alpine forelands of Central Europe. Experiments were carried out in the years 2011 and 2012 for testing the relative performance of different mulching and no tillage treatments on surface runoff and erosion. The tested treatments for the year 2011 were a) no tillage with prior rough seedbed (NT 1), b) no tillage with prior fine seedbed (NT 2), c) mulching with rotary harrow (M 1), d) mulching with rotary harrow and disc harrow (M 2) and e) conventional tillage (CT 11). The tested treatments for the year 2012 were a) combined mulching (MC), b) mulching with loosened wheel tracks (M−T), c) mulching without loosened wheel tracks (M+T) and d) conventional tillage (CT 12). In 2011, <b>total</b> surface <b>runoff</b> and <b>total</b> soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: NT 1 <NT 2 <CT 11 <M 1 <M 2. No significant differences for total soil loss could be identified. For <b>total</b> surface <b>runoff</b> differences were significant (p< 0. 05) between all treatments, except for NT 2 and CT 11. The treatments also differed with respect to runoff initiation, sediment concentrations and shear stress. As a main reason for the unexpected bad performance of the mulching treatments M 1 and M 2 lack of sufficient soil cover (M 1 : 6 %, M 2 : 11 %) together with shallow surface cultivation were identified. In 2012, <b>total</b> surface <b>runoff</b> and <b>total</b> soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: MC<M−T<CT 12 <M+T. Although there were a visible trend in these results, significant differences could only be observed for <b>total</b> surface <b>runoff</b> between treatments MC and M+T (p< 0. 05). We attribute the good performance of treatment MC to the improved soil cover (25 %). Wheel tracks of treatment M+T obviously had influenced soil erosion and surface runoff. Under real life conditions of agricultural conservation practices in small scale farming systems, a sufficient soil cover was not obtained for mulching treatments in 2011 and only partially in 2012. In contrast to the vast majority of literature that stresses the positive and even dramatically positive effects of conservation tillage treatments compared with conventional agricultural management techniques, our results reveal possible problems when applying these best management techniques in small scale farming systems...|$|R
