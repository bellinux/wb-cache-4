5|$|The Xscape {{match is}} the third {{specialty}} match primarily used in TNA. It is held annually at TNA's Lockdown PPV event in April—an all–steel cage format PPV event. The first two Xscape matches were held {{to determine the number}} one contender to the TNA X Division Championship, while, since 2007, it has been contested for the X Division Championship. The contest involves four to six participants. To win this match, two or more participants—depending on how many are involved in the encounter—must be eliminated by pinfall or submission leaving only two participants. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> then race to see who escapes the cage first to claim victory.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger {{with his bare hands}} and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} fifteen to twenty years {{interest}} has been growing {{in the study of}} masculinities. This article presents a discussion of material from in-depth interviews with <b>two</b> <b>men</b> who took part in a larger study of masculinity and health-related behavior. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> spontaneously referred to themselves during in-depth interviews as not being a manly man or a man's man. Consideration of what these men said provides interesting insights into the links between discourses of masculinity and subjective experiences of masculinityparticularly whether masculinity is perceived in binary or pluralistic terms. The experiences of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> give hope to young men who reject hegemonic masculinity but still desire to have a clear masculine identity...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year, Henry III {{commanded the}} Justiciar of Ireland, John fitz Geoffrey (died 1258), to prohibit Magnús from raising {{military forces in}} Ireland for an invasion of Mann. A year later Magnús succeeded to the kingship, as the chronicle records that he returned to Mann and, {{with the consent of}} the people, began his reign. There are indications that opposition to Magnús, and thus possibly support of Haraldr, continued into the mid 1250s. For example, the chronicle records that when Hákon bestowed upon Magnús the title of king in 1254, it further notes that when Magnús' opponents heard of this, they became dismayed and that their hopes of overthrowing him gradually faded away. Furthermore, a letter of protection, written on behalf of Henry to Magnús in 1256, orders Henry's men not to receive Haraldr and Ívarr, which may thus indicate that <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> were still alive and active. Although Magnús' eldest brother, Haraldr Óláfsson, appears to have ruled over the entirety of the dynasty's thirteenth-century sea-realm, as did Magnús from 1252 onwards, the situation during the years between Haraldr Óláfsson's death and Magnús' accession is uncertain, and {{it is possible that the}} kingdom was partitioned between feuding dynasts, as it had been during the bitter inter-dynastic strife of the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries. Clearly the situation in the Isles was unsettled in the 1250s. For example, Henry is known to have written letters to Alexander, Hákon, and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (died 1282), the co-ruler of Gwynedd, ordering them not allow their men invade Mann in Magnús' absence there in 1254.|$|E
