5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission {{a study to}} look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, to combat <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact.

5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, {{even trying to}} take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had {{focused more on}} military, foreign affairs and the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{concession}} speech {{emphasized the}} dangers of nuclear war and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election {{from the state of}} Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Each side {{considered}} {{how best}} to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> its opponent, and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E

5|$|English colonial {{traders and}} explorers from Carolina, since its {{founding}} in 1670, had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended {{all the way to the}} Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.|$|E
5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 {{to examine whether}} the central keep could {{be turned into a}} Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E
5|$|Pinto Colvig as Grumpy and Sleepy in a dual role: Grumpy {{initially}} disapproves of Snow White's {{presence in}} the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Queen and rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs and is frequently seen with one eye shut. Sleepy is always tired and appears laconic in most situations. Sterling Holloway, who would later voice many other characters for future Disney films was originally considered to voice Sleepy by Walt Disney.|$|E
5|$|The French Atlantic fleet {{was even}} more {{dispersed}} than the British {{in the spring of}} 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the British fleet under Lord Howe.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 in response to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action {{throughout the rest of}} Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public warning of the danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
5|$|A storm {{causes the}} ship to crash, and the group awakens to {{discover}} that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and that {{the leaders of the}} Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
