5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> anthropogenic and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|Guanche mummies are the {{intentionally}} desiccated {{remains of}} members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands. The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century. The methods of embalming are similar to <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> used by the Ancient Egyptians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debra's {{development}} {{near the}} coast was unusual, complicating forecasting {{in addition to}} its rapid intensification and abnormal direction. The lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> received further complicated Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> communist and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E
5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier {{to search}} out an eastern route to Asia, the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by Kaiser had been largely ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.|$|E

40|$|The {{organization}} of the constituent polypeptides of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase was studied by using two membrane-impermeable probes, diazobenzene[35 S]sulphonate and lactoperoxidase-catalysed radioiodination. The incorporation of label into the subunits of the isolated enzyme <b>was</b> compared with <b>that</b> obtained with enzyme immunoprecipitated from labelled mitochondria or inverted submitochondrial particles. On the basis of accessibility to these two labels, we divide the polypeptides of Complex I into five groups: <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> apparently buried in the enzyme, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> accessible to labelling in the isolated enzyme {{but not in the}} membrane, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> exposed on the matrix face and finally <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> exposed on both faces and are therefore transmembranous. We conclude <b>that</b> NADH dehydrogenase <b>is</b> asymmetrically organized across the inner mitochondrial membrane...|$|R

5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> under his jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Because Lazenby had {{informed}} the producers that On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was to be}} his only outing as Bond {{and because of the}} lack of gadgets used by Bond in the film, few items of merchandise were produced for the film, apart from the soundtrack album and a film edition of the book. <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> produced included a number of Corgi Toys, including Tracey's Cougar, Campbell's Volkswagen and two versions of the bobsleigh—one with the 007 logo and one with the Piz Gloria logo.

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae {{for a variety of}} large theropods, usually <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus, Piveteausaurus, Yangchuanosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Compsosuchus, Stokesosaurus, and Szechuanosaurus. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission.
