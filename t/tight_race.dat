5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} <b>tight</b> <b>race</b> for the November general election. Negative ads {{from both sides}} dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E

25|$|Acevedo Vilá won the Puerto Rico General Elections of 2004 by {{approximately}} 3,880 votes (0.2 {{percent of the}} vote) over former governor Pedro Rosselló. However, since the margin of victory was so small, a full recount of the elections took place. During the period, Rosselló filed a civil lawsuit against Acevedo Vilá himself over a dispute of certain ballots that were cast during the elections. Acevedo Vilá is also the first elected governor born after {{the adoption of the}} 1952 Constitution of Puerto Rico.

25|$|The 5000 metres final {{was held}} {{on the final day}} of the Championships. In his second-best event, Vainio {{surprised}} the Finnish audience with a bronze medal.

As in the 10,000 metres race, Werner Schildhauer took the silver, beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio won his bronze medal in an extraordinary way; he flung himself in the last 5 metres and fell flat on his face. As a result, he beat Dmitri Dmitriyev, who was fourth, by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race to be the most sentimental event in his career.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 General Election, Fleetwood {{was joined}} with Lancaster and some Over Wyre {{locations}} {{to form the}} new Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency.

40|$|Drawing upon recent {{results on}} bandwagons in {{sequential}} voting, and by deriving analogous results for simultaneous voting, I compare the information aggregation {{properties of the}} two processes. The conclusions con…rm commonly held views about the front-loading of presidential primaries: that in <b>tight</b> <b>races</b> a simultaneous vote is preferred as {{it is more likely}} to lead to the selection of the “better ” candidate, but in lopsided races a sequential vote is preferred. Strangely, the superior performance of sequential voting in lopsided races is precisely because bandwagons occur...|$|R
