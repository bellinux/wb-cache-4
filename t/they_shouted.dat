25|$|In {{contrast}} with Ringelmann's first findings, Bibb Latané et al. replicated previous social loafing findings while demonstrating that the decreased performance of groups was attributable to reduced individual effort, {{as distinct from}} a deterioration due to coordination. They showed this by blindfolding male college students while making them wear headphones that masked all noise. They then asked them to shout both in actual groups and pseudogroups in which <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> alone but believed they were shouting with others. When subjects believed one other person was shouting, <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> 82% as intensely as they did alone, but with five others, their effort decreased to 74%.|$|E

Children from across Japan sent in {{drawings}} of sumo wrestlers on postcards, which Iwai scanned. During the program the audience called in and, watching their televisions at home, shouted into the telephone; the louder <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> the stronger their sumo wrestler became, finally pushing the opposing wrestler out of the dohyō.|$|E

25|$|The {{leader of}} the group was called Grandpa. The other koledari {{gathered}} at his house {{on the eve of}} koleda, and at midnight they all went out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> and made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff in his hand and spun hemp fibers. The koledari teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the koleda. Some of them were called alosniks, the men possessed by the demon ala. There could have been other named characters in the group.|$|E
25|$|Tan {{organised}} {{a victory}} parade on 12 May, and received {{permission from the}} police to hold it. However, the participants deviated from the authorised route, jamming traffic, and entered a predominantly Malay area of Kuala Lumpur, where <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> racial epithets. On 13 May, UMNO organised a retaliatory march, and armed groups of Malays gathered at the capital, Kuala Lumpur. The march degenerated into a racial riot, and the violence continued for two days. Official statistics later put the total dead {{in the area of}} 200, although unofficial ones give a figure five times higher. A state of emergency was declared, and Parliament was suspended. The newly formed National Operations Council (NOC), led by Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, took power. Parliament did not reconvene until 1972.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{example of}} Lampião's activities, and his {{ambivalent}} nature, is his descent {{on the small}} town of Queimadas in Bahia, which took place in December 1929. His band entered the town, and immediately shut down the telegraph office to stop news from spreading. The seven policemen in the town and their sergeant were shut in the jail, whilst the jail's previous occupants were set free. The wealthiest citizens of the town were then levied for a forced monetary contribution. The bandits, however, paid for items, including soap and perfume, taken from the town's shops. The seven policemen were summarily executed by shots to the head, but their sergeant was left unharmed as he was liked by the townspeople. In the evening Lampião organised a baile, a dance for the townspeople and his cangaceiros. He also ordered a cinema show to be presented. The bandits were under strict instructions not to molest the local young women, and such was Lampião's authority that none were. The bandits left the town at 4:00 in the morning; Lampião rode a borrowed mule, which he later duly returned to its owner. On one occasion he attacked a large town, Mossoró in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, in June 1927. The bandits began their assault on the town to the sound of a bugle; when advancing <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> vivas and sang their special song, Mulher Rendeira (The Lacemaker). However, the inhabitants had time to organise a defence, and 300 armed townsmen drove off Lampião's 60 cangaceiros.|$|E

25|$|Although Sumter was a masonry fort, {{there were}} wooden {{buildings}} inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires {{that could prove}} more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames {{and at the same}} time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.|$|E

[...] Officers entered a gay bar called the Elephant Walk, despite their orders not to do so. <b>They</b> <b>shouted</b> [...] "dirty cocksuckers" [...] and [...] "sick faggots", shattered the large plate glass windows of the bar, and attacked patrons. After 15 minutes police withdrew from the bar and joined other officers who were indiscriminately attacking gays on the street. The incident lasted nearly two hours.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{a review}} of CCTV footage, the {{programme}} purports {{to demonstrate that the}} self-immolators donned fire-proof clothing and masks, and raises the question of why the participants' hair and the apparently gasoline-filled bottles they carried did not catch fire. Falun Gong sources also noted that the self-immolators' behaviour, the slogans <b>they</b> <b>shouted,</b> and their meditation postures were not consistent with the teachings or practices of Falun Gong. Furthermore, the program's frame-by-frame analysis of the CCTV footage purportedly shows that Liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to the head from a man in a military overcoat. The False Fire documentary described the death of 12-year-old Liu Siying as being under [...] "unusual circumstances", saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 March. Some Falun Gong sources argue that she may have been killed by the government as a way of guaranteeing her silence.|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from usual practice, Chamberlain did not issue any resignation Honours list. With Chamberlain remaining leader of the Conservative Party, and with many MPs still supporting him and distrusting the new Prime Minister, Churchill refrained from any purge of Chamberlain loyalists. Churchill wished Chamberlain {{to return to the}} Exchequer, but he declined, convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the Labour Party. Instead, he accepted the post of Lord President of the Council with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet. When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, {{for the first time since}} his resignation, [...] "MPs lost their heads, <b>they</b> <b>shouted,</b> they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation." [...] However, Churchill was received coolly by the House. Some of Churchill's great speeches to the House, such as [...] "We shall fight on the beaches", met with only half-hearted enthusiasm there.|$|E
500|$|The most {{influential}} {{of the contemporary}} reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year. Boullemer claimed {{to be among the}} few surviving eyewitnesses: [...] "there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [...] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes. [...] <b>They</b> <b>shouted,</b> running the streets: peace! [...] peace!" [...] Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. Louis-Charles-César Maupassant, a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence, but could not be heard above the din. [...] Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered [...] before the threatening crowd. [...] According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts. [...] At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd {{at the feet of the}} deputy, Maupassant. [...] The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} days of 1017 the Byzantine emperor renewed his campaigns. He sent David Arianites and Constantine Diogenes to pillage along the River Vardar and {{captured}} the castle of Longos. After that he marched south and besieged Kastoria. Under the walls of the town Basil II received messages from Tzitzikios, the Byzantine strategos of Dorostolon (Silistra), that Ivan Vladislav had sent Krakra to negotiate assistance from the Pechenegs and that they were crossing the Danube. The Byzantine emperor immediately abandoned the siege and hurried northwards, but in the vicinity of Lake Ostrovo he learned that the Pechenegs were unwilling to risk war. Returning south, Basil II captured Setina, where Samuel used to have a palace and acquired for himself the large amount of provisions that were stored there. Ivan Vladislav, who was closely monitoring the Byzantine movements, ambushed the troops who were under the command of Constantine Diogenes, who would have perished had not Basil II come to relieve him. According to John Skylitzes, the Emperor charged alone in front of his army to Diogenes' rescue. When the Bulgarians saw him, <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> [...] "Run, the Emperor" [...] ("") and retreated in panic. Contented with their victory, the Byzantines moved on to Voden and returned to Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Mawhood {{ordered his}} light troops to delay Mercer, while {{he brought up}} the other detachments. Mercer was walking through William Clark's orchard when the British light troops appeared. The British light troops' volley went high which gave time for Mercer to wheel his troops around into battle line. Mercer's troops advanced, pushing back the British light troops. The Americans took up a {{position}} behind a fence at {{the upper end of}} the orchard. However, Mawhood had brought up his troops and his artillery. The American gunners opened fire first and for about ten minutes, the outnumbered American infantry exchanged fire with the British. However, many of the Americans had rifles which took longer to load than muskets. Mawhood ordered a bayonet charge and because many of the Americans had rifles, which could not be equipped with bayonets, they were overrun. Both of the Americans' cannons were captured, and the British turned them on the fleeing troops. Mercer was surrounded by British soldiers and <b>they</b> <b>shouted</b> at him [...] "Surrender you damn rebel!". Declining to ask for quarter, Mercer chose to resist instead. The British, thinking they had caught Washington, bayoneted him, and then left him for dead. Mercer's second in command, Colonel John Haslet, was shot through the head and killed.|$|E
