The judgment of that age, as has been already noticed, is always to be referred rather to the head than to the heart; and a poem, written to please mere critics, requires an introduction and display of art, to the exclusion of natural beauty.--This explains the extravagant panegyric <b>of</b> <b>Lee</b> on Dryden's play: ...|$|R
5000|$|ChicagoFest, {{started by}} mayor Michael Bilandic, was the {{precursor}} to the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago. After Bilandic's tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted to end the festival {{as well as many}} other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne's attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting the Taste, slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. The popularity <b>of</b> the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout the United States, such as the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> the Danforth in Toronto, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Kalamazoo, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Addison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Denver, <b>Taste</b> in Dallas, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Madison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Austin, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few.

It must be added however that, thanks to his constant habit of shaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience, he presently found the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lees</b> rising as usual into his draught. His imagination had in other words already dealt with his young friend's assertion; of which it had made something that sufficiently came out on the very next occasion of his seeing Maria Gostrey. This occasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstance--a circumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance of. [...] "When I said to him last night," [...] he immediately began, [...] "that without some definite word from him now that will enable me to speak to them over there of our sailing--or at least of mine, giving them some sort of date--my responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation awkward; when I said that to him what do you think was his reply?" [...] And then as she this time gave it up: [...] "Why that he has two particular friends, two ladies, mother and daughter, about to arrive in Paris--coming back from an absence; and that he wants me so furiously to meet them, know them and like them, that I shall oblige him by kindly not bringing our business to a crisis till he has {{had a chance to see}} them again himself. Is that," [...] Strether enquired, [...] "the way he's going to try to get off? These are the people," [...] he explained, [...] "that he must have gone down to see before I arrived. They're the best friends he has in the world, and they take more interest than any one else in what concerns him. As I'm his next best he sees a thousand reasons why we should comfortably meet. He hasn't broached the question sooner because their return was uncertain--seemed in fact for the present impossible. But he more than intimates that--if you can believe it--their desire to make my acquaintance has had to do with their surmounting difficulties." ...|$|R
