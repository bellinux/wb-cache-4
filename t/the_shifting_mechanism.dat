50|$|In linguistics, {{shifting}} {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} constituents appearing {{on the same side}} of their common head exchange positions in a sense to obtain non-canonical order. The most widely acknowledged type of shifting is heavy NP shift, but shifting involving a heavy NP is just one manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Shifting occurs in most if not all European languages, and it may in fact be possible in all natural languages. Shifting is not inversion, and inversion is not shifting, but the two mechanisms are similar insofar as they are both present in languages like English that have relatively strict word order. The theoretical analysis of shifting varies in part depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes relatively flat structures, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. Shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The weight of a constituent is determined by a number of factors: number of words, contrastive focus, semantic content, etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Semi-spherical CVT(SS-CVT) {{is one of}} {{friction}} drives, which transmits power via the friction force between a spherical shaped variator and output disks. The variator varies the speed ratio of SS-CVT continuously as well as transmits input power into the output shaft. Therefore two friction forces are normally applied on the variator; one is the longitudinal friction force for power transmission {{and the other is}} the lateral for shifting. In order to investigate the dynamic behavior of SS-CVT, we introduced a numerical model of 2 -dimensional friction force using a function of slip ratio and slip angle. And a dynamic model, which describes <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of SS-CVT, is developed through 3 -dimensional vector analysis. Finally we presented numerical results of the shift characteristics focused on the transient behavior of the variator’s slip ratio and slip angle.

We define the notion of bit equivalent encodings and show that for such encodings the corresponding Walsh coefficients are also conserved. We focus on Gray codes as particular types of encoding and present a review of properties related {{to the use of}} Gray codes. Gray codes are widely used in conjunction with genetic algorithms and bit-climbing algorithms for parameter optimization problems. We present new convergence proofs for a special class of unimodal functions; the proofs show that a steepest ascent bit climber using any reflected Gray code representation reaches the global optimum in a number of steps that is linear with respect to the encoding size. There are in fact many different Gray codes. Shifting is defined as a mechanism for dynamically switching from one Gray code representation to another in order to escape local optima. Theoretical results that substantially improve our understanding of the Gray codes and <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> are presented. New proofs also shed light on the number of unique Gray code neighborhoods accessible via shifting and on how neighborhood structure changes during shifting.

Optimizing the design in terms of topology, material and structural is very important in arriving at practical solution.   To determine the optimum material layout distribution of material within the component with given set of loads and boundary conditions by placing a constrain on volume by minimizing sum of weighted compliance as well as maximizing lowest eigen value frequency. The process starts by applying loads to the gear shifter and constraining it in all directions thereby making the gear shifter a stiff design which can withstand loads from all direction. Boundary conditions {{play a major role in}} designing the component geometry.   Contact formulation has been complex task from several years. Optimization with contact for minimizing the volume by maintaining uniform deformation between  contact surfaces between two commercial softwares, HyperWorks V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ has been compared with benchmarks.   By using these techniques weight reduction has been achieved in automobile gear shifter housing and benchmarks with contact condition had been compared using Altair OptiStruct V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ by Niclas Strömberg. ...|$|E

50|$|Beyond {{the ease}} of use from a driver's standpoint, an {{additional}} benefit of sequential manual gearboxes is that use of the clutch via foot pedal or hand control can be minimized or completely obviated, with the clutch used only for starting from a complete stop. Formula One cars of the 1990s made the most high-profile debut of this technology in motor sports, and enhanced variations on this theme are still in use in many forms of road racing and drag racing today. The simple push-pull action of <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> also lends itself to semi-automatic control using either hydraulic or pneumatic actuators—a system {{often referred to as}} paddle-shift. Instead of a manual gear lever, the driver is provided with (usually) a pair of flipper paddles on the steering wheel, rally cars often utilize just a double-acting single paddle. Pulling on the right-hand paddle makes an up-shift and pulling on the left-hand paddle makes a down-shift. The paddle-shift system will use a sophisticated electronic control unit to provide the necessary logic to operate <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This type of paddle-shift system fitted to race and rally cars {{should not be confused with}} most of the current crop of paddle-shift systems fitted to some high-end road cars.

40|$|Over the years, {{the use of}} PM {{machines}} {{has been}} increasing in the offshore wind industry and marine industry. The industries thrive on efficient function of the PM machines. These machines are prone to electro-mechanical faults due to environmental conditions and maintenance. Out of all these faults, stator internal faults are concerning as they can lead to insulation failures which may take around 30 seconds to expand and lead to a fire on ships, or on wind turbines. These type of faults develop gradually, which gives the opportunity to control the fault currents before they reach dangerous levels. Rolls Royce Marine AS is also working to tackle this problem for their hybrid propulsion shaft generator. DNVGL requires the generator to be made electrically dead during such event and the long-term propulsion should not be affected. During such conditions, WTs are either turned off or field weakening is used to develop a fault tolerant control (FTC) by the help of power electronics for the WT. FTC helps the machine not to be turned off completely, but less power is generated during fault conditions. An alternative efficient field weakening method using a Dual Rotor PMSM was suggested for both the applications. The DR-PMSM has two rotors instead of one, with identical surface mounted magnets on both rotors. One of these rotors {{has the capacity to}} rotate with respect to the other, {{in order to reduce the}} flux or completely short the flux path by misalignment of rotors. The machine stator is exactly like the conventional PMSM. The machine is capable of reducing the induced emf to zero by field weakening. In this thesis a transient 3 D finite element model is presented to test the credibility of the machine. A 2 D FEM of a conventional PMSM was also built to check the validity of the machine. It is seen that torque is a function of the active length of the machine, and if a gap is introduced between the rotors then the total length of the machine must be increased. Also, axial flux component which induces eddy currents in the stator teeth was studied. By modeling anisotropy in the stator iron, certain hot spots could be seen in the middle part of the stator. The forces that were in <b>the</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> were studied and it was concluded that machine cogging can be reduced to reduce the effect of these forces. A machine prototype was also built which confirms the field weakening capability of the machine. The DR-PMSM works like a conventional PMSM but with flux weakening capabilities and can be implemented on marine and wind turbine applications for these type of fault conditions...|$|E
