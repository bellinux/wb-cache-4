50|$|<b>Trans-regulatory</b> {{elements}} are genes which may modify (or regulate) {{the expression of}} distant genes. More specifically, <b>trans-regulatory</b> {{elements are}} DNA sequences that encode transcription factors.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, <b>trans-regulatory</b> {{elements}} are diffusible factors, usually proteins, that may modify {{the expression of}} genes distant from the gene that was originally transcribed to create them. For example, a transcription factor that regulates a gene on chromosome 6 might itself have been transcribed from a gene on chromosome 11. The term <b>trans-regulatory</b> is constructed from the Latin root trans, which means [...] "across from".|$|E
50|$|There are cis-regulatory and <b>trans-regulatory</b> {{elements}}. Cis-regulatory {{elements are}} often binding sites {{for one or}} more trans-acting factors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trans-regulatory</b> {{elements}} {{work through}} an intermolecular interaction between two different molecules {{and so are}} said to be [...] "acting in trans". For example (1) a transcribed and translated transcription factor protein derived from the <b>trans-regulatory</b> element; and a (2) DNA regulatory element that is adjacent to the regulated gene. This is in contrast to cis-regulatory elements that work through an intramolecular interaction between different parts of the same molecule: (1) a gene; and (2) an adjacent regulatory element for that gene in the same DNA molecule.|$|E
50|$|To summarize, cis-regulatory {{elements}} are {{present on the}} same molecule of DNA as the gene they regulate whereas <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements can regulate genes distant from the gene from which they were transcribed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{molecular}} biology, trans-acting (<b>trans-regulatory,</b> trans-regulation), in general, means [...] "acting from a different molecule" [...] (i.e., intermolecular). It may be considered the opposite of cis-acting (cis-regulatory, cis-regulation), which, in general, means [...] "acting from the same molecule" [...] (i.e., intramolecular).|$|E
50|$|Cis-regulatory {{elements}} are sequences {{that control the}} transcription of a nearby gene. Many such {{elements are}} involved in the evolution and control of development. Cis-elements may be located in 5' or 3' untranslated regions or within introns. <b>Trans-regulatory</b> elements control the transcription of a distant gene.|$|E
5000|$|It is well {{established}} that cis and <b>trans-regulatory</b> complexes contain unique combinations of proteins based on cell and tissue specific conditions (Dekker et al., 2006). While identification of single, functional TFBS is a significant advancement, the use of ChIA-PET to identify individual proteins in a complex would require guess work and multiple experiments to identify each interacting protein. This would be a costly and time consuming endeavour.|$|E
50|$|Since each cell, {{regardless}} of cell type, possesses the same genome, determination of cell type must {{occur at the}} level of gene expression. While the regulation of gene expression can occur through cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements including a gene's promoter and enhancers, the problem arises as to how this expression pattern is maintained over numerous generations of cell division. As it turns out, epigenetic processes {{play a crucial role in}} regulating the decision to adopt a stem, progenitor, or mature cell fate. This section will focus primarily on mammalian stem cells.|$|E
50|$|A {{minigene}} is {{a minimal}} gene fragment that includes an exon {{and the control}} regions necessary for the gene to express itself {{in the same way}} as a wild type gene fragment. This is a minigene in its most basic sense. More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and intron(s). Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating splicing patterns both in vivo and in vitro biochemically assessed experiments. Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter vectors (also called exon-trapping vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both cis-regulatory elements (RNA effects) and <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements (associated proteins/splicing factors) affect gene expression.|$|E
50|$|Scientists use {{a number}} of methods to study the complex {{structures}} and functions of the 3' UTR. Even if a given 3'-UTR in an mRNA is shown {{to be present in}} a tissue, the effects of localization, functional half-life, translational efficiency, and trans-acting elements must be determined to understand the 3'-UTR's full functionality. Computational approaches, primarily by sequence analysis, have shown the existence of AREs in approximately 5 to 8% of human 3'-UTRs and the presence of one or more miRNA targets in as many as 60% or more of human 3'-UTRs. Software can rapidly compare millions of sequences at once to find similarities between various 3' UTRs within the genome. Experimental approaches have been used to define sequences that associate with specific RNA-binding proteins; specifically, recent improvements in sequencing and cross-linking techniques have enabled fine mapping of protein binding sites within the transcript. Induced site-specific mutations, for example those that affect the termination codon, polyadenylation signal, or secondary structure of the 3'-UTR, can show how mutated regions can cause translation deregulation and disease. These types of transcript-wide methods should help our understanding of known cis elements and <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors within 3'-UTRs.|$|E
5000|$|RNA {{splicing}} errors {{have been}} estimated {{to occur in}} a third of genetic diseases. To understand pathogenesis and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention in these diseases, explicating the splicing elements involved is essential. Determining the complete set of components involved in splicing presents many challenges due to the abundance of alternative splicing, which occurs in most human genes, and the specificity in which splicing is carried out in vivo. [...] Splicing is distinctly conducted from cell type to cell type and across different stages of cellular development. Therefore, {{it is critical that}} any in vitro or bioinformatic assumptions about splicing regulation are confirmed in vivo. [...] Minigenes are used to elucidate cis-regulatory elements, <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements and other regulators of pre-mature RNA splicing in vivo. Minigenes have been applied to the study of a diverse array of genetic diseases due to the aforementioned abundance of alternatively spliced genes and the specificity and variation observed in splicing regulation. The following are examples of minigene use in various diseases. While it is not an exhaustive list, it does provide {{a better understanding of how}} minigenes are utilized.|$|E
40|$|Mutation is the {{ultimate}} source of phenotypic variation. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of new mutations in the absence of natural selection and whether these effects can influence the course of evolution. This is particularly true for changes in gene expression and regulation. In this thesis I measure the effects of new cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations on the expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH 3 gene. Using these measurements, I show that cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations have fundamentally different effects on gene expression. In particular, I find that cis-regulatory mutations are on average larger than <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations and skewed towards decreases in TDH 3 expression, while <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations are often, but not always, more common than cis-regulatory mutations and skewed towards increases in TDH 3 expression. To determine how natural selection has acted on these differences, I generate genome sequences and genetically tractable versions of over 60 diverse S. cerevisiae strains previously isolated from a range of environments. I use these strains to determine the effects of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> polymorphism on TDH 3 expression. Comparing these effects to the effects of new mutations, I find that natural selection has acted on both cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> variants. Interestingly, the effects of selection varies between cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes due to differences in the effects of new mutations. Using the same approach, I also identify differences in the action of natural selection on cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes for the variability in expression amongst genetically identical individuals, i. e. gene expression noise. Finally, I determine the evolution of regulatory changes over long evolutionary timescales in Saccharomyces. I find widespread evidence for compensatory changes in regulation, particularly for <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes that act in opposite directions. Consistent with this finding, I identify hundreds of trans-acting QTL affecting TDH 3 expression amongst four strains of S. cerevisiae. Together these results suggest that <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes are a common, but individually small, source of regulatory variation. In total, this thesis shows that understanding the effects of new mutations and comparing these effects to observed differences in natural populations can be a powerful approach for elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms governing evolution...|$|E
40|$|Both {{hybridization}} and allopolyploidization generate novel phenotypes by conciliating divergent genomes {{and regulatory}} {{networks in the}} same cellular context. To understand the rewiring of gene expression in hybrids, the total expression of 21, 025 genes and the allele-specific expression of over 11, 000 genes were quantified in interspecific hybrids and their parental species, Coffea canephora and Coffea eugenioides using RNA-seq technology. Between parental species, cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergences affected around 32 % and 35 % of analyzed genes, respectively, with nearly 17 % of them showing both. The relative importance of <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergences between both species {{could be related to}} their low genetic divergence and perennial habit. In hybrids, among divergently expressed genes between parental species and hybrids, 77 % was expressed like one parent (expression level dominance), including 65 % like C. eugenioides. Gene expression was shown to result from the expression of both alleles affected by intertwined parental <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors. A strong impact of C. eugenioides <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors on the upregulation of C. canephora alleles was revealed. The gene expression patterns appeared determined by complex combinations of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergences. In particular, the observed biased expression level dominance seemed to be derived from the asymmetric effects of <b>trans-regulatory</b> parental factors on regulation of alleles. More generally, this study illustrates the effects of divergent <b>trans-regulatory</b> parental factors on the gene expression pattern in hybrids. The characteristics of the transcriptional response to hybridization appear to be determined by the compatibility of gene regulatory networks and therefore depend on genetic divergences between the parental species and their evolutionary history...|$|E
40|$|Hybrids between {{species are}} often {{characterized}} by novel gene-expression patterns. A recent study on allele-specific gene expression in hybrids between species of Drosophila revealed {{cases in which}} cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements within species had coevolved {{in such a way}} that changes in cis-regulatory elements are compensated by changes in <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements. We hypothesized that such coevolution should often lead to gene misexpression in the hybrid. To test this hypothesis, we estimated allele-specific expression and overall expression levels for 31 genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F 1 hybrid. We found that 13 genes with cis-trans compensatory evolution are in fact misexpressed in the hybrid. These represent candidate genes whose dysregulation might be the consequence of coevolution of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements within species. Using a mathematical model for the regulation of gene expression, we explored the conditions under which cis-trans compensatory evolution can lead to misexpression in interspecific hybrids...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{organization of}} the exoenzyme S <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus was studied by using promoter fusion and transcriptional start site mapping analyses. The 5 ' regions flanking open reading frames encoding ExsC, ExsB, ExsA, and ExsD were cloned in both orientations into the promoter vector pQF 26, which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene (cat). CAT activity from each promoter fusion transformed into Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was measured. The <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus promoters demonstrated low to undetectable CAT activity in E. coli regardless of {{the orientation of the}} DNA fragment relative to the reporter gene. In P. aeruginosa two of the promoter clones containing DNA located 5 ' of exsC (pC) and exsD (pD) demonstrated significant CAT activity. Transcriptional initiation from pC and pD was dependent on the orientation of the DNA fragment, the inclusion of a chelator in the growth medium, and the presence of a functional exsA gene. Transcriptional start sites were mapped for the pC and pD promoter regions by using total RNA isolated from P. aeruginosa strains grown in medium including a chelator. Our data are consistent with an operon model for the transcriptional {{organization of the}} exoenzyme S <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus. In addition, ExsA appears to be involved in controlling transcriptional initiation from both the <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus and a region located immediately downstream of the exsA gene...|$|E
40|$|In {{the studies}} {{reported}} here, we {{have examined the}} properties of the Mcp element from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex (BX-C). We have found that sequences from the Mcp region of BX-C have properties characteristic of Polycomb response elements (PREs), and that they silence adjacent reporters by a mechanism that requires trans-interactions between two copies of the transgene. However, Mcp <b>trans-regulatory</b> interactions have several novel features. In contrast to classical transvection, homolog pairing {{does not seem to be}} required. Thus, <b>trans-regulatory</b> interactions can be observed not only between Mcp transgenes inserted at the same site, but also between Mcp transgenes inserted at distant sites on the same chromosomal arm, or even on different arms. Trans-regulation can even be observed between transgenes inserted on different chromosomes. A small 800 -bp Mcp sequence is sufficient to mediate these long-distance <b>trans-regulatory</b> interactions. This small fragment has little silencing activity on its own and must be combined with other Polycomb-Group-responsive elements to function as a "pairing-sensitive" silencer. Finally, this pairing element can also mediate long-distance interactions between enhancers and promoters, activating mini-white expression...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical {{interactions}} between cis-regulatory DNA sequences and <b>trans-regulatory</b> gene products suggest that cis- and trans-acting polymorphisms may interact genetically. Here {{we present a}} strategy {{to test this hypothesis}} by comparing the relative cis-regulatory activity of two alleles in different genetic backgrounds. Of the eight genes surveyed in this study, five were affected by trans-acting variation that altered total transcript levels, two of which were also affected by differences in cis-regulation. The presence of trans-acting variation had no effect on relative cis-regulatory activity, showing that cis-regulatory polymorphisms can function independently of <b>trans-regulatory</b> variation. The frequency of such independent interactions on a genomic scale is yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Varicella-zoster {{virus is}} the {{etiological}} agent of chickenpox and zoster in humans and {{belongs to the}} Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily within the family Herpesviridae. Much of the current understanding of gene regulation in alphaherpesviruses has been derived from studies of the prototype herpes simplex virus (HSV). In HSV, two virus-encoded, <b>trans-regulatory</b> proteins, ICP 4 and ICP 27, are essential for the replicative cycle of the virus. ICP 4 is important in modulating HSV genes of all three kinetic classes, whereas the <b>trans-regulatory</b> effects of ICP 27 are primarily associated with the expression of late genes. Recent evidence indicates that the <b>trans-regulatory</b> effects of ICP 27 involve posttranscriptional processing of target gene transcripts (R. M. Sandri-Golding and G. E. Mendoza, Genes Dev. 6 : 848 - 863, 1992). The ICP 27 homolog in varicella-zoster virus is a 452 -amino-acid polypeptide encoded by the open reading frame 4 (ORF 4) gene. Contrary to what is found with ICP 27, we show that the ORF 4 polypeptide is a transcriptional activator of diverse target promoters and has a critical requirement {{for the presence of}} upstream elements within these promoters to mediate its transcriptional effects. Evidence is also presented to implicate a critical role for the cysteine-rich, C-terminal region of the ORF 4 polypeptide in its <b>trans-regulatory</b> functions. Specifically, by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrate that of 10 cysteine residues in the ORF 4 polypeptide, only C- 421 and C- 426 are essential for transactivator function and suggest that these cysteine residues may participate in critical protein-protein interactions rather than protein-nucleic acid interactions to mediate ORF 4 inducibility...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is a complex}} trait determined by various genetic and nongenetic factors. Among the genetic factors, allelic difference may {{play a critical role}} in gene regulation. In this study we globally dissected cis (allelic) and trans sources of genetic variation in F 1 hybrids between two Arabidopsis thaliana wild accessions, Columbia (Col) and Vancouver (Van), using a new high-density SNP-tiling array. This array tiles the whole genome with 35 -bp resolution and interrogates 250, 000 SNPs identified from resequencing of 20 diverse A. thaliana strains. Quantitative assessment of 12, 311 genes identified 3811 genes differentially expressed between parents, 1665 genes with allele-specific expression, and 1688 genes controlled by composite <b>trans-regulatory</b> variation. Loci with cis- or <b>trans-regulatory</b> variation were mapped onto sequence polymorphisms, epigenetic modifications, and transcriptional specificity. Genes regulated in cis tend to be located in polymorphic chromosomal regions, are preferentially associated with repressive epigenetic marks, and exhibit high tissue expression specificity. Genes that vary due to trans regulation reside in relatively conserved chromosome regions, show activating epigenetic marks and generally constitutive gene expression. Our findings demonstrate a method of global functional characterization of allele-specific expression and highlight that chromatin structure is intertwined with evolution of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> variation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Phenotypic {{evolution}} {{may occur}} through mutations that affect either the structure or expression of protein-coding genes. Although {{the evolution of}} color vision has historically been attributed to structural mutations within the opsin genes, recent {{research has shown that}} opsin regulatory mutations can also tune photoreceptor sensitivity and color vision. Visual sensitivity in African cichlid fishes varies {{as a result of the}} differential expression of seven opsin genes. We crossed cichlid species that express different opsin gene sets and scanned their genome for expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) responsible for these differences. Our results shed light on the role that different structural, cis-, and <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations play in the evolution of color vision. Results: We identified 11 eQTL that contribute to the divergent expression of five opsin genes. On three linkage groups, several eQTL formed regulatory “hotspots ” associated with the expression of multiple opsins. Importantly, however, the majority of the eQTL we identified (8 / 11 or 73 %) occur on linkage groups located trans to the opsin genes, suggesting that cichlid color vision has evolved primarily via <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergence. By modeling the impact of just two of these <b>trans-regulatory</b> eQTL, we show that opsin regulatory mutations can alter cichlid photoreceptor sensitivity and color vision at least as much as opsin structural mutations can. Conclusions: Combined with previous work, we demonstrate that the evolution of cichlid color vision results fro...|$|E
40|$|In {{species with}} a {{heterogametic}} sex, population genetics theory predicts that DNA sequences on the X chromosome can evolve faster than comparable sequences on autosomes. Both neutral and nonneutral evolutionary processes can gen-erate this pattern. Complex traits like gene expression are not predicted to have accelerated evolution by these theories, yet a “faster-X ” pattern of gene expression divergence {{has recently been}} reported for both Drosophila and mammals. Here, we test the hypothesis that accelerated adaptive evolution of cis-regulatory sequences on the X chromosome is responsible for this pattern by comparing the relative contributions of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes to patterns of faster-X expression divergence observed between strains and species of Drosophila {{with a range of}} divergence times. We find support for this hypothesis, especially among male-biased genes, when comparing different species. However, we also find evidence that <b>trans-regulatory</b> differences contribute to a faster-X pattern of expression divergence both within and between species. This contribution is surprising because trans-acting regulators of X-linked genes are generally assumed to be randomly distributed throughout the genome. We found, however, that X-linked transcription factors appear to preferentially regulate expression of X-linked genes, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for this result. The contribution of <b>trans-regulatory</b> variation to faster-X expression divergence was larger within than between species, suggesting that it is more likely to result from neutral processes than positive selection. These data show how accelerate...|$|E
40|$|Mutation is {{the root}} of all genetic variation. A new {{mutation}} may exhibit little or no effect. A mutation in the coding region of a gene may affect the gene product’s structure and function. A mutation can also impact gene expression. Gene expression is the process through which information encoded in the DNA is converted to the molecular machinery carrying out specific biological functions, ultimately generating higher-order phenotypes. Mutations that modify gene expression can therefore contribute to phenotypic variation. In this dissertation, I characterize the effects of mutations and natural genetic variants that impact gene expression to better understand how mutations contribute to gene expression variation. To characterize an array of genetic variants, I used a fluorescent reporter controlled by the promoter of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TDH 3. I first investigate the effect of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations. Prior studies suggest that cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci may exhibit larger effect on average than trans-acting ones, yet little is known empirically regarding the difference in effect of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations. I directly compared cis-regulatory mutants to previously isolated <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutants and found that cis-regulatory mutations intrinsically have larger effects than <b>trans-regulatory</b> mutations. Next, I investigate the contribution of mutations to cis-regulatory variation in TDH 3 expression. Determining the evolutionary contribution of mutation and selection among regulatory variation is challenging due to lack of functional annotation among regulatory sequences. Instead of choosing putatively non-functional sites as the neutral model, I used an empirical null distribution of functional effects of cis-regulatory mutations for comparison. The results suggest that mutation underlies TDH 3 cis-regulatory variation in mean expression level while selection may have favored decreased expression noise via epistasis. Lastly, I investigate the effect of genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions on mutations to gain further mechanistic insight into how the mutation process contributes to expression variation. I characterized cis-regulatory mutations in environments reflecting conditions in which TDH 3 functions and found GxE interactions to be common. These results and their implications on the evolutionary impact of the mutation process are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Bristles on the notum of many cyclorraphous flies are {{arranged}} into species-specific stereotyped patterns. Differences in the spatial {{expression of the}} proneural gene scute correlate with the positions of bristles in those species looked at so far. However, the examination {{of a number of}} genes encoding <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors, such as pannier, stripe, u-shaped, caupolican and wingless, indicates that they are expressed in conserved domains on the prospective notum. This suggests that the function of a <b>trans-regulatory</b> network of genes is relatively unchanged in derived Diptera, and that many differences are likely to be due to changes in cis-regulatory sequences of scute. In contrast, in Anopheles gambiae, a basal species with no stereotyped bristle pattern, the expression patterns of pannier and wingless are not conserved, and expression of AgASH, the Anopheles proneural gene, does not correlate in a similar manner with the bristle pattern. We discuss the possibility that independently acting cis-regulatory sequences at the scute locus may have arisen in the lineage giving rise to cyclorraphous flies...|$|E
40|$|We have {{searched for}} <b>trans-regulatory</b> genes in two genetic systems in Drosophila, the bithorax complex (BX-C) and the achaete-scute complex (AS-C). Previous genetic {{evidence}} suggests that the activation of both BX-C and AS-C, depends on <b>trans-regulatory</b> genes (Polycomb, Pc, in the former and hairy, h, in the latter) acting in a negative type of control. Mutants of these regulatory genes in heterozygous condition have dominant derepression phenotypes in flies with extra doses of the corresponding gene complexes. We have searched for new loci, with similar gene-dose relationships. We have isolated only new alleles (six) of Pc in the BX-C experiment. In the AS-C experiment four h alleles, and 13 alleles of a new locus (extramacrochaetae, emc) have been discovered. Whereas the h locus shows specific interactions upon achaete, the new locus, emc, is specific for the scute part of the AS-C.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is critical for}} organismal function and is {{an important source of}} phenotypic diversity between species. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulatory divergence is therefore expected to provide insight into evolutionary change. Using deep sequencing, we quantified total and allele-specific mRNA expression levels genome-wide in two closely related Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. sechellia) and their F 1 hybrids. We show that 78 % of expressed genes have divergent expression between species, and that cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergence affects 51 % and 66 % of expressed genes, respectively, with 35 % of genes showing evidence of both. This is a relatively larger contribution of <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergence than was expected based on prior studies, and may result from the unique demographic history of D. sechellia. Genes with antagonistic cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes {{were more likely to be}} misexpressed in hybrids, consistent with the idea that such regulatory changes contribute to hybrid incompatibilities. In addition, cis-regulatory differences contributed more to divergent expression of genes that showed additive rather than nonadditive inheritance. A correlation between sequence similarity and the conservation of cis-regulatory activity was also observed that appears to be a general feature of regulatory evolution. Finally, we examined regulatory divergence that may have contributed to the evolution of a specific trait—divergent feeding behavior in D. sechellia. Overall, this study illustrates the power of mRNA sequencing for investigating regulatory evolution, provides novel insight into the evolution of gene expression in Drosophila, and reveals general trends that are likely to extend to other species...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} genetic {{mechanisms that}} underlie phenotypic evolution include mutations within protein-coding, cis-regulatory, and <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors. Although {{many studies have}} examined how these mutations individually contribute to phenotypic divergence {{and the formation of}} new species, none have examined how they may do so collectively. In this study, I examine how these molecular genetic mutations collectively contribute to the evolution of color vision among African cichlid fishes. I show that phenotypic divergence in cichlid color vision is achieved by mutations affecting the coding sequence and expression of seven opsin genes. After contrasting the roles of these two mechanisms, I use bioinformatic-, association-, and experimental genetic analyses to determine what role mutations in cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> DNA play in the evolution of cichlid opsin expression. Specifically, I demonstrate that: (1) 	Protein-coding mutations primarily affect cichlid opsins sensitive {{to the ends of the}} visible light spectrum (SWS 1 [ultraviolet-sensitive] and LWS [red-sensitive]). (2) 	Changes in opsin gene expression contribute to large differences in color vision among closely related species. These analyses also reveal that the expression of the SWS 1 and SWS 2 B opsins have diverged among closely related cichlids in association with foraging preferences and ambient light intensity, suggesting that their expression has evolved due to natural selection. Ancestral state reconstructions reveal that changes in opsin expression have evolved repeatedly among cichlids in Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi; further, I find that this repeated evolution has likely been achieved by repeated changes to cichlid development. (3) 	Bioinformatic analyses suggest that cichlids have diverged in multiple cis-regulatory sequences surrounding the opsin genes, and association mapping identified three putative single nucleotide polymorphisms upstream of the SWS 2 A (blue), RH 2 B (blue-green), and LWS (red) opsins that may contribute to cichlid opsin expression differences in cis. (4) 	Genetic mapping in experimental crosses suggests that divergence in multiple <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors also contribute to the evolution of SWS 2 B (violet), RH 2 A (green), and LWS (red) opsin expression. The contribution of these <b>trans-regulatory</b> factors to the evolution of cichlid opsin expression may outweigh those in cis. These results reveal that multiple molecular genetic mechanisms can contribute to phenotypic evolution among closely related species...|$|E

Synthesis of exoenzyme S depends on an intact <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus encoding three protein products, ExsC, ExsB, and ExsA. To identify the phenotype of ExsC, -B, and -A mutants in exoenzyme S production, specific insertional mutations with the streptomycin resistance-encoding omega interposon were introduced into cloned DNA {{and returned to}} the chromosomes of P. aeruginosa PA 103, PAO 1, and PAK. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm insertion of omega and resolution of vector sequences. Exoenzyme S expression was measured in parental and mutant derivatives by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity measurement. A complete set of mutations were obtained in strains PAK and PAO 1, but in strain PA 103, only an insertion in the exsA coding region was identified. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that extensive duplication and rearrangement of the PA 103 chromosomal <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus occurred when exsC::omega or exsB::omega recombination events were attempted. Exoenzyme S antigen was not detectable in the supernatant or lysate fractions of mutant strains by Western blot analysis. ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was detected in the lysate but not in the supernatant fractions of mutant derivatives. The general secretion pathway appeared to function normally in mutant strains, as elastase, exotoxin A, and phospholipase C were measured in the supernatants of parental and mutant strains. Several differences were noted when the extracellular protein profiles of parental strains were compared with similar samples from the insertional mutant strains. Some of these differences appeared to be unrelated to exoenzyme S. These data suggest that insertional inactivation of the exoenzyme S <b>trans-regulatory</b> locus may affect a subset of other extracellular proteins...|$|E

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression {{across multiple}} tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40 % of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot {{be accounted for by}} common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility.

40|$|Understanding the {{patterns}} and causes of phenotypic divergence {{is a central}} goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as <b>trans-regulatory</b> changes play {{a greater role in}} divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F 1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of non-H- 2 linked genes on the plasma {{levels of the}} H- 2 S-region encoded proteins C 4, Slp, and factor B was tested in Recombinant Inbred (RI) strains. The A X B and B X A RI strains exhibit a continuous range of C 4 and Slp levels from very high to very low which reach beyond the levels of their parental strains, C 57 BL/ 6 J and A/J, indicating involvement of several <b>trans-regulatory</b> (non-H- 2 -linked) genes. Only limited variation in levels of factor B has been found. No linkage relationship could be established for the <b>trans-regulatory</b> genes, because more than one gene is involved. A complex interaction of H- 2 haplotype, genetic background, sex, and possibly maternal effect in determining the C 4 and Slp protein plasma levels has been observed. The H- 2 -dependent sex effect is evident, because males have higher C 4 levels than females in RI strains with H- 2 (b) but not with H- 2 (a) haplotype. This sex effect is also background dependent, because it {{is present in the}} H- 2 (b) congenic strain on A background (A. BY) but not in C 57 BL/ 10 and C 57 BL/ 6 (both H- 2 (b)). Mice from RI strains with H- 2 (b) haplotype have in general higher C 4 levels than mice with H- 2 (a) haplotype...|$|E
40|$|Promoters {{are thought}} {{to play a major}} role in {{adaptive}} evolution, yet little is known about the regulatory diversity within species, where microevolutionary processes take place. To investigate the potential for evolutionary change in the promoter of a gene, we examined nucleotide and functional variation of the Chalcone Synthase (CHS) cis-regulatory region in Arabidopsis thaliana. CHS is the branch point enzyme of a biosynthetic pathway that leads to the production of secondary metabolites influencing the interaction between the plant and its environment. We found that nucleotide diversity in the intergenic region encompassing the CHS promoter (π = 0. 003) is compatible with neutral expectations. To quantify functional variation specifically as a result of cis-regulation of CHS mRNA levels, we developed an assay using F 1 individuals in which distinct promoter alleles are compared within a common <b>trans-regulatory</b> background. We examined functional cis-regulatory variation in response to different stimuli representing a variety of CHS transcriptional environments (dark, light, and insect feeding). We observed extensive functional variation, some of which appeared to be independent of the <b>trans-regulatory</b> background. Comparison of functional and nucleotide diversity suggested a candidate point mutation that may explain cis-regulatory differences in light response. Our results indicate that functional changes in promoters can arise from a few mutations, pointing to promoter regions as a fundamental determinant of functional genetic variation...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} identified many genetic variants associated with complex traits. However, at {{only a minority}} of loci have the molecular mechanisms mediating these associations been characterized. In parallel, whilst cis-regulatory patterns of gene expression have been extensively explored, the identification of <b>trans-regulatory</b> effects in humans has attracted less attention. We demonstrate that the Type 2 diabetes and HDL-cholesterol associated cis-acting eQTL of the maternally-expressed transcription factor KLF 14 acts as a master trans-regulator of adipose gene expression. Expression levels of genes regulated by this trans-eQTL are highlycorrelated with concurrently-measured metabolic traits, and a subset of the trans-genes harbor variants directly-associated with metabolic phenotypes. This trans-eQTL network provides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNLRP 3 inflammasome plays a {{critical}} role in the activation of caspase- 1 and maturation of IL- 1 β. However, the specific cis- and <b>trans-regulatory</b> elements that determine the extent of NLRP 3 expression are not well defined. In this study, we found NLRP 3 expression was induced by TLR agonists in murine macrophages in a NF-κB dependent manner. Furthermore, the corresponding NF-κB binding sites (nt − 1303 to − 1292 and − 1238 to − 1228) were identified in the NLRP 3 promoter. Finally, EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated LPS-induced NF-κB binding to the NLRP 3 promoter. Therefore, out results delineated the molecular mechanisms involved in TLR-induced transcriptional regulation of NLRP 3...|$|E
