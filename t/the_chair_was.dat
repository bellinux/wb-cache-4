French designer Philippe Starck designed a total of 14 chairs and 4 tables for Emeco.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> real.|$|E
5|$|Güell's {{first task}} for Gaudí, that same year, was {{the design of}} the {{furniture}} for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaudí's teacher, {{at the request of the}} Marquis of Comillas, Güell's father in law. Gaudí designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Llorenç Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.|$|E

5|$|On the {{occasion}} of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaudí constructed the pavilion for the Compañía Trasatlántica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Marítim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Saló de Cent and the grand stairs in Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> made, and Mayor Francesc Rius i Taulet presented it to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level.|$|E

25|$|The Eames plastic {{armchair}} immediately {{became an}} iconic design and eventually <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> used in schools, airports, restaurants, and offices around the world.

25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century the United States {{produced}} {{vast numbers of}} chairs, in factories, and an experienced factory painter could paint a chair {{in less than five}} minutes.

25|$|In 1919, the Coverdale Chair was {{presented}} to St Mary's by T E Foster MacGeagh of Hadlow Castle. The chair is so-named because it was owned by Miles Coverdale, Bishop of Exeter, who made the first translation of the Bible into English. In 1954, <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Rochester Cathedral, but it was returned to St. Mary's in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The Eames Molded Plastic & Fiberglass Armchair is a {{fiberglass}} chair, {{designed by}} Charles and Ray Eames, that {{appeared on the}} market in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> intentionally designed for the ‘International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design.’ This competition, sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art, was motivated by the urgent need in the post-war period for low-cost housing and furnishing designs adaptable to small housing units.|$|E

25|$|The AU met in Khartoum on January 23 and January 24, 2006.

Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, became the Chairperson of the African Union's Assembly of Heads of State. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> originally supposed to return to Sudan, but at the request of several AU members, President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir decided to relinquish his position in view of the AU's participation in the resolution of the Darfur conflict.

25|$|In 1828, de Vatimesnil, {{minister}} {{of public instruction}} in Martignac's ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousin's greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> {{the symbol of the}} triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of Pierre Abélard. The lecturer's eloquence mingled with speculative exposition, and he possessed a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.|$|E

25|$|Usually <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> {{fastened}} {{to a long}} wooden beam fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the victim died.|$|E

25|$|Folklore {{seems to}} have favoured the loser {{in the battle of}} the giants, as Goram is commemorated in the {{features}} Goram’s Chair and Footprint (some versions seem to treat these as the same thing, saying that <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> <b>was</b> formed by the giant stamping his foot) and Soap-Dish in the gorge of the Hazel Brook. Perhaps the nearby feature Lover’s Leap also recalls the legend, but this is a conventional name for precipices which often have unsubstantiated tales of lovers' suicides attached. A pub of the early 1960s on the Lawrence Weston housing estate in west Bristol is called The Giant Goram, and there was formerly (from about 1954 sporadically to 1996) a funfair bearing Goram’s name on the Blaise Castle landed estate (by then in the hands of Bristol City Council) in Henbury.|$|E
