5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> conditions.|$|E

The turnpike continues through a mix of rural land and suburban residential development north of Pittsburgh into Allegheny County.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E

But without enough {{force on the}} ground to mop up the remaining defenders, <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> could not be opened.

5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} few miles in Saratoga County, I-87 runs across lightly {{developed}} {{parts of the}} towns of Halfmoon and Clifton Park. Near exit9, however, the freeway passes through the commercial center of Clifton Park as it connects to NY146. Clifton Park Center, one of several shopping plazas at the junction, is situated southwest of <b>the</b> <b>exit.</b> Past exit9, the commercial development subsides as I-87 traverses another area dominated by housing tracts. Just north of <b>the</b> <b>exit,</b> the freeway passes a rest area for northbound traffic. The freeway continues on, passing {{to the west of}} the centers of Round Lake at exit11 and Malta at exit12. After Malta, I-87 turns slightly to the northeast and begins to loosely parallel the northwestern edge of Saratoga Lake as it crosses Kayaderosseras Creek and enters Saratoga Springs.|$|E

I-35E also carries the legislative route of I-35—unsigned legislative route 390—through the Twin Cities. On the other hand, the portion of I-35E through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul is a controversial four-lane parkway that heavy trucks are prohibited from using.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, {{it seems likely that}} the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking <b>the</b> <b>exit),</b> they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E
5|$|Lemmings {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} levels, grouped into four {{difficulty}} categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.
