5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion thought {{that she had seen}} Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt over what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes with her back to England.|$|E

25|$|Although the SPGB {{claim to}} follow Marx's precepts, {{they claim to}} follow them {{simply because they are}} correct in their own right, not because Marx was a special individual, {{sometimes}} quoting his own contention that Je ne suis pas marxiste (I am not a Marxist). They do, however, often challenge {{the use of the term}} Marxist in the media, specifically when used to describe guerrilla and terrorist movements that have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the SPGB considers to be working-class socialist emancipation.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has very little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — {{as reported in the}} earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E
25|$|After {{the passage}} of Measure 47, {{as part of the}} ongoing anti-tax {{movement}} in Oregon, there was some confusion as to how the measure would be interpreted by the courts. One interpretation had the ballot measure reducing property tax revenues by $458 million in the fiscal year 1997–1998, while another interpretation, provided by the Oregon Attorney General, had it providing a reduction of only $270 million. Much of this disagreement had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> limitations Measure 47 would place on increases in the assessment of a property's value.|$|E
25|$|Daken offers Evan {{a suit of}} Apocalypse's Celestial armor <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he will, {{secretly}} {{planning to}} control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the Shadow King. After Deadpool's failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine's death at Daken's hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members Sabretooth and Mystique. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse's armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool {{will always be there}} for him when he needs him.|$|E

25|$|Later Wolof-language films include Xala (1975, {{based on}} his own novel), Ceddo (1977), Camp de Thiaroye (1987), and Guelwaar (1992). The Senegalese release of Ceddo was heavily censored, ostensibly for a problem with Sembène's paperwork, though some critics suggest that this {{censorship}} had more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> {{could be interpreted as}} anti-Muslim content in the film. However, Sembène distributed fliers at theaters describing the censored scenes and released it uncut for the international market. In 1971, Sembène also made a film in the Diola language and French entitled Emitaï, which was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival, where it won a Silver Prize. It was also banned throughout French West Africa. His 1975 film Xala was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Starkey {{appeared}} as a guest on the BBC's Newsnight programme together with Owen Jones and Dreda Say Mitchell, made during {{a discussion about the}} 2011 England riots. Starkey claimed that [...] "the whites have become black", and that [...] "a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture has become the fashion". The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying [...] "they are racist comments, frankly". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general. Rod Liddle argued in support of the remarks. Fellow panellist Owen Jones described the comments as [...] "one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash", claiming that [...] "multiculturalism and ethnic groups have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> happened".|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was {{based on the fact that}} he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to." ...|$|E

He is also highly energetic (as if hyped up by caffeine), and is quite a pushover. Series concerning Pudú's visits usually result in him offering {{to go home and}} fetch something to help with the current situation, only to return three to six months later and find that the object he has fetched now has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what's</b> currently happening.|$|R

[...] Tucker singled out [...] "Sultans of Swing" [...] for its [...] "inescapable hook" [...] and [...] "Bob Dylan-like snarl in its vocal". He also praised [...] "Setting Me Up" [...] as a [...] "heavenly number, funny and bitter." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
2500|$|However, in late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, court {{depositions}} by Trustees Kenneth Frazier and Keith Masser conflicted with the [...] "failure of leadership" [...] story.

The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from Jaws. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war.

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do has something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's {{been going on in}} your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E
