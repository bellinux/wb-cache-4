50|$|It is Norea who {{cries out}} to them. They heard, and they {{received}} her into her place forever. They {{gave it to}} her in the Father of Nous, Adamas, as well as the voice of the Holy Ones, in order <b>that</b> she <b>might</b> rest in the ineffable Epinoia, in order <b>that</b> she <b>might</b> inherit the first mind which she had received, and <b>that</b> she <b>might</b> rest in the divine Autogenes, and <b>that</b> she (too) <b>might</b> generate herself, just as she also has inherited the living Logos, and <b>that</b> she <b>might</b> be joined to all of the Imperishable Ones, and speak with the mind of the Father.|$|R

60|$|Coningsby {{began to}} talk about the wonders of the factory, but Mr. Millbank recurred to other {{thoughts}} that were passing in his mind. He spoke of his son: he expressed a kind reproach that Coningsby should have thought of visiting {{this part of the world}} without giving them some notice of his intention, <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> have been their guest, <b>that</b> Oswald <b>might</b> have been there to receive him, <b>that</b> they <b>might</b> have made arrangements that he should see everything, and in the best manner; in short, <b>that</b> they <b>might</b> all have shown, however slightly, the deep sense of their obligations to him.|$|R

5|$|The {{school has}} {{developed}} a specific program focus that includes film, photography, writing, and art, using Gordon Parks's life as an inspiration and guide.

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk.

60|$|The most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, {{pure and}} simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their necks; {{and the rest}} were slaves in fact, but without the name; they {{imagined}} themselves men and freemen, and called themselves so.
