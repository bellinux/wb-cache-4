40|$|Copyright Â© 2014 Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) This study {{proposes a}} novel {{non-linear}} fault tolerant scheme for longitudinal control of an aircraft system, comprising an integral {{sliding mode control}} allocation scheme and a backstepping structure. In fault free conditions, the closed loop system is governed by the backstepping controller and the integral sliding mode control allocation scheme only influences the performance if faults/failures occur in the primary <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In this situation, the allocation scheme redistributes the <b>control</b> signals to <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and <b>the</b> scheme is able to tolerate total failures in the primary actuator. A backstepping scheme taken from the existing literature is designed for flight path angle tracking (based on the non-linear equations of motion) and this is used as the underlying baseline controller in nominal conditions. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated using a high-fidelity aircraft benchmark model. Excellent results are obtained {{in the presence of}} plant/model uncertainty in both fault free and faulty conditions...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a {{hierarchical}} distributed control method is proposed for balancing SoC and controlling power as required from dispatching center in DBESS.

30|$|The main {{principle}} of the consensus control with pinning node is to consider the DBESS shown in Fig. 3 as a network-connected distributed system. Each BESU contains the primary <b>control</b> and <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> <b>The</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> of BESU which is selected as the pinning node, can receive the dispatching command from the system.

40|$|In power systems, <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> is a {{very useful}} way to restore the system {{frequency}} and voltage to the rated value. This paper tries to propose a secondary frequency and voltage control of islanded microgrids based on the distributed synergetic control of multi-agent systems. In the proposed control, since each distributed generation only requires its own information and that of <b>the</b> neighbors, <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> is fully distributed. The system is more reliable because the central controller and complex communication network are reduced in the distributed structure.

40|$|In {{standard}} implementations of distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> for DC MicroGrids (MGs), {{the exchange}} of local measurements among neighboring control agents is enabled via off-the-shelf wireless solutions, such as IEEE 802. 11. However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise {{the stability of the}} MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, <b>the</b> jammed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by nonjammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control.</b> <b>The</b> strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed improved via software-defined networking approaches.

40|$|Balancing {{the active}} and the {{reactive}} {{power in a}} stand-alone micro-grid is a critical task. A micro-grid without energy storage capability is even more vulnerable to stability issues. This paper investigates a distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> to maintain <b>the</b> rated voltage in a stand-alone micro-grid. Here multiple machine learning algorithms have been implemented to provide <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> where a primary control scheme is insufficient to maintain a stable voltage after a sudden change in the load. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> is monitored by a centralized system and {{in most of the}} cases it does not interfere. Based on different contingencies the proposed method would suggest different machine learning algorithms which are previously trained with similar data. The contingencies are based on an imbalance either in the active or in the reactive power in the system.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} control framework that utilizes dc-dc converters to achieve flexible {{power flow control}} in multiterminal dc (MTDC) grids. The dc-dc converter employed in this paper is connected in cascade with the dc transmission line, and is therefore named cascaded power flow controller (CPFC). In this paper, a two-layer control strategy is developed for the operation and control of voltage source converter stations and CPFC station in MTDC grids. At the primary control layer, a novel differential voltage droop control is developed, while at <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> layer, a modified dc power flow algorithm-employing the new CPFC framework-is implemented. The overall control strategy enables the CPFC to regulate the power flow in the dc transmission line. The primary control guarantees the transient stability of the CPFC, and <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> system ensures <b>the</b> desired steady-state operation. The proposed voltage droop control framework helps the MTDC grid to remain stable {{in the event of}} a communication failure between <b>the</b> primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> layers.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to construct a control law that realizes a main task and simultaneously takes supplementary constraints into account. Classically, this is done by using the redundancy formalism. If the main task does not constrain all the motions of <b>the</b> robot, a <b>secondary</b> task can be achieved by using only the remaining degrees of freedom (DOF). We propose a new general method that frees up some of the DOF constrained by the main task in addition of the remaining DOF. The general idea is to enable the motions produced by <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> law that help the main task to be completed faster. The main advantage is to enhance the performance of <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> task by enlarging the number of available DOF. In a formal framework, a projection operator is built which ensures that <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>control</b> law does not disturb the main task. A control law can be then easily computed from the two tasks considered. Experiments that implement and validate this approach are proposed.

Microgrids are able to operate in gridconnected and islanded mode and present themselves to the utility network as controllable entities. For the primary control of the inverter-interfaced DG units, voltage-based droop controllers have been developed. With this fully distributed controller, an optimized integration of renewable energy is obtained, by possibly increasing the penetration depth of renewable DG units and mitigating over-voltage conditions.
