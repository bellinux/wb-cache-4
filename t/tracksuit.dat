50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, <b>tracksuits</b> made a {{comeback}} in mainstream fashion {{for both men}} and women. They returned to the fabrics of the 1970s, most notably polyester.

500|$|There were {{accusations that}} certain {{foodstuffs}} – usually reported as pizza, but occasionally reported as coffee, tomato soup or pea soup – {{had been thrown}} at Ferguson by an unknown Arsenal player.

Speculation that the player who threw the pizza was Cesc Fàbregas arose when Cole hinted that the culprit was neither English nor French. In his autobiography, Ferguson said: [...] "They say it was Cesc Fàbregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, I have no idea who the culprit is."

500|$|The October 2004 league match, staged at Old Trafford, was blighted by {{a number}} of fouls, {{overlooked}} by referee Mike Riley, including striker Van Nistelrooy's studs-up challenge on Cole.

The home side were awarded a penalty when Wayne Rooney was adjudged to have been fouled in the area by Campbell. Van Nistelrooy scored and late in the game Rooney scored to give United a 2–0 win. Tempers flared in the tunnel afterwards; Wenger confronted Van Nistelrooy for his tackle on Cole, but Ferguson intervened and told him to leave his players alone. Pizza was thrown at Ferguson by an Arsenal player, which forced him to change into the club <b>tracksuit</b> in order to carry out his television duties.

500|$|Introduced as a {{young man}} with blond, spiky hair, blue eyes and goggles, Naruto Uzumaki {{frequently}} wears an orange <b>tracksuit.</b> Following his ninja graduation he also wore a headband that denotes his position as a ninja from Konohagakure. In Part II of the manga, the now older and larger Naruto wears a different outfit. The [...] Nine-Tailed Demon Fox within influences his body, causing Naruto to resemble the Fox {{over the course of his}} battles. While Naruto only shows small changes such as sharp teeth and claws initially, he later develops a red tail made of the Fox's vital energy, or chakra. The red chakra starts by surrounding his body; once four tails are manifested, Naruto's blood begins to merge with the chakra, coloring his entire body red. As the sixth tail appears, Naruto appears to wear the Fox's skeleton, but once Naruto takes control of the fox's chakra, he is able to maintain his regular form while using it. As a ninja, Naruto carries many weapons, but relies mostly on his ninja techniques while fighting, specializing in making clones of himself. Nevertheless, late in the series Naruto starts wielding a pair of bō in combat.|$|E
