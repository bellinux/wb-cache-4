5|$|Naem {{typically}} has a short shelf life, {{which can}} be extended through refrigeration. <b>The</b> <b>sausage</b> can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to prepare. In Thailand, it is typically stored at room temperature, which gives it a shelf life of around one week. It is also produced in areas of Southeast Asia near Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted <b>the</b> <b>sausage</b> in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used.|$|E
5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of <b>the</b> <b>sausage.</b>|$|E

50|$|In Norway, {{sausages}} {{are most}} often served in white buns, or in the more traditional lompe. <b>The</b> <b>sausages</b> are grilled or warmed in hot water, and they are normally served with ketchup and mustard.

25|$|Since some cooking {{vessels and}} {{utensils}} (such as ceramic dishes and wooden spoons) are porous, {{it is possible}} for them to become infused with the taste of certain foods and transfer this taste to other foods.

25|$|Although {{children}} perceive {{rhythmic patterns}} {{in their native}} language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>sausage)</b> to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
25|$|The Black Watch {{returned}} after two months, and deployed to the Hook with one Rifle company being deployed {{on each of}} the features' four hills, Point 121, the Hook, <b>the</b> <b>Sausage</b> and Point 146. Another rifle company was loaned from the Dukes to be deployed on Point 146. The Black Watch found the Hook to be the same as when they left it; a constant barrage of shelling with the Chinese habitually targeting the supply route leading up {{to the back of the}} ridge, a large proportion of their shells landing close to the Black Watch Command Post. The Chinese artillery was based in a semi-circle of hills opposite the Hook, the guns were kept in tunnels, manhandled out to fire and then quickly pushed back again to safety away from UN counter bombardment and air attacks. The Dukes relieved the Black Watch on the night of 12/13 May 1953 and expected to be attacked at any time. They fought the next battle for the Hook two weeks later.|$|E

500|$|Naem is a red-colored, {{semi-dry}} lactic-fermented pork sausage in Thai cuisine prepared using minced raw {{pork and}} pork skin, {{significant amounts of}} cooked sticky rice, chili peppers, garlic, sugar, salt and potassium nitrate. [...] Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation. After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags and left to ferment for three to five days. Naem has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation, in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within <b>the</b> <b>sausage.</b> The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar, {{and the use of}} salt prevents the meat from rotting.|$|E

500|$|Cooking {{techniques}} for the leeks vary, as some recipes call {{for them to}} be mixed in raw, while others suggest browning them first in a frying pan. If left raw, they can lend a crunchier texture to <b>the</b> <b>sausage.</b> Both the Hairy Bikers and Canteen opt for cooking the leeks first. A variety of herbs are used, with Canteen using sage as seen in the Perkins recipe, in addition to nutmeg. The Welsh Gas Board recipe simply called for [...] "mixed herbs", while Felicity Cloake in The Guardian suggested the addition of thyme. For the frying, the gas board and chef Sophie Grigson suggested the use of lard, while the Bikers used vegetable oil. Both Cloake and The Daily Telegraph writer Nigel Godwin proposed frying Glamorgan sausages in butter.|$|E

40|$|Dutch style {{fermented}} sausages were manufactured with a {{substitution of}} 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of pork backfat by flaxseed oil and canola oil, pre-emulsified with soy protein isolate. The 15 % and 20 % substitution were also reached by adding encapsulated flaxseed oil and encapsulated fish oil and by adding flaxseed oil, pre-emulsified with sodium caseinate, respectively. The products were sliced, packaged in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere {{and stored in}} the dark for 12 weeks at 7 °C. No differences were detected in moisture, protein and fat content between control and modified <b>sausages,</b> with <b>the</b> exception of the formulation with sodium caseinate. The PUFA/SFA ratio increased from 0. 30 in the control to 0. 42 - 0. 48 in <b>the</b> <b>sausages</b> with canola oil and to 0. 49 - 0. 71 in <b>the</b> <b>sausages</b> with flaxseed oil.

The addition of canola oil and encapsulated flaxseed oil resulted in a comparable shelf life as the control in terms of lipid oxidation.
