5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>canteen</b> sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from <b>the</b> <b>canteen</b> were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from <b>the</b> <b>canteen</b> or the black market.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} and land were auctioned off in July 1843 and purchased for £5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger. The property {{consisted of the}} keeper's house, <b>the</b> <b>canteen</b> (known as a suttling house), the Admiralty section, the chapel, a three-story brick building and eight brick houses, all closed off from Borough High Street by iron gates. Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or refusal to pay, and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.|$|E
5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} <b>the</b> <b>canteen</b> and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced}} to turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E

50|$|Cover, Water <b>Canteen</b> - <b>The</b> group {{rejected}} the test item and retained the M-1967 nylon water canteen cover modified by stiffening the closing flaps {{so that they}} would not collapse and interfere with the insertion of the water canteen; to enlarge <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cover somewhat for easier insertion and extraction of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cup; to add a reinforcement band to the inside of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cover to help prevent the lip of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cup from rubbing through; and add a grommet drain hole in the bottom. As requested by the NCO Board, the test cover was made without a pile liner, whose purpose was to provide evaporative cooling, and with openings in the bottom to provide better drainage and to make extraction of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cup easier. However, the test indicated that the pile liner added shape to <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cover and kept it from collapsing completely when empty, making insertion of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cup much easier. The tests also determined that the openings in the bottom constituted a camouflage hazard as the metal of <b>the</b> water <b>canteen</b> cup bottom was exposed.|$|R
