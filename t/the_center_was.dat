5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September10, with evidence of a low-level circulation and convective banding. It moved west-northwestward, located south of a subtropical ridge. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Nine by 1200UTC on September11 to the south of the Cape Verde islands. Upon its formation, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>was</b> poorly defined, with restricted easterly outflow due to easterly wind shear. After about 24hours of remaining somewhat disorganized, the convection became more concentrated on September12 as banding features and outflow improved. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gert, the seventh named storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>was</b> put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E

5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>was</b> a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>was</b> almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E
