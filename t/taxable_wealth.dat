Community stability is defined which provides the framework on which the model was created. The achievement of the four goals of the 1944 Sustained Yield Act is tested using indicators. The four goals are the achievement of stability in the forest industries, in employment, in <b>taxable</b> forest <b>wealth</b> and in the community. Indicators used are: forest industries - production, efficiency and investment; employment - employment trend, unemployment and regional share (shift-share analysis); <b>taxable</b> forest <b>wealth</b> - real property; community - birth rate, age class distribution, median family income, number below poverty level, number of food stamp recipients, divorce rate, suicide rate and crime rates. The model is described and tested using the Lakeview Federal Sustained Yield Unit as an example. Lake County figures are used to represent the communities in the Federal Sustained Yield Unit. In most cases these figures are compared to Klamath and Harney counties' figures. Community stability in the Lakeview Federal Sustained Yield Unit was found to have been achieved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} four essays. The first paper, "Real or Evasion Responses to the Wealth Tax? Theory and Evidence from Sweden", {{addresses the}} behavioral {{effects of an}} annual wealth tax. I use Swedish tax records over the period 1999 - 2006 and two sources of variation in the tax rate to estimate the elasticity of <b>taxable</b> net <b>wealth</b> at about 0. 3. I decompose the effects into reporting and savings responses and find that {{an increase in the}} tax is likely to stimulate evasion. Using military enlistment records on cognitive ability, I find that high-skilled individuals respond more to the tax. The second paper, "Job Displacement and Labor Market Outcomes by Skill Level", uses previously unexplored administrative data on all displaced workers in Sweden 2002 - 2004 to estimate how the incidence and effects of job loss depend on cognitive and noncognitive skills. I find that workers with low ability are significantly more likely to be displaced but the recovery rates upon job loss show no significant differences across skill groups. The third paper, "Complementary Roles of Connections and Performance in Political Selection in China", analyzes who becomes a top politician in China. It focuses on the promotions of provincial leaders and estimates how performance - measured by provincial economic growth – and connections with top politicians – measured by having worked together in the past – influence promotions. Using data for the period 1993 - 2009, we find a positive correlation between promotion and growth that is stronger for connected leaders. The fourth paper, "Does the Demand for Redistribution Rise or Fall with Cognitive Ability?", uses data from enlistment and a tailor-made survey that elicits redistributional preferences. On a scale of 0 to 100 percent redistribution, a one standard deviation increase in cognitive ability lowers demand by 6 percentage points, also when controlling for past, current and future expected income...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{does not}} have either an annual net wealth tax or a tax on gifts and inheritances. In this study the {{taxation}} of wealth is reviewed. The {{focus is on the}} annual net wealth tax, although death taxes also receive some consideration. Drawing on first principles of taxation, the taxation of wealth is examined according to the key criteria for judging tax systems: equity, efficiency, administration and revenue. A comprehensive system of taxing income includes all accretions to wealth, including gifts and bequests. Therefore a separate tax on wealth is necessary if inheritances and gifts are excluded from an income tax system. There are also strong grounds for taxing wealth to achieve horizontal and vertical equity between taxpayers. As well as income earned from wealth, all other benefits that result from <b>wealth</b> ownership represent <b>taxable</b> capacity. <b>Wealth</b> taxes cause efficiency costs by distorting the choices of individuals. As with other taxes such as income and consumption taxes, there is a trade-off between achieving objectives of equity and efficiency. Investigation of the real incidence of wealth taxes reveals that wealth taxes, in the long run, may be borne in part by consumers and by co-factors of production such as labour, as well as by owners of capital. Evidence from the Western European countries that successfully operate an annual net wealth tax indicates that a wealth tax is no more difficult to administer than an income tax. Wealth taxes make a relatively small contribution to the tax revenue of countries that implement them. The potential revenue from an Australian wealth tax would also be relatively small. There is considerable, and it seems increasing, inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in Australia. An objective of wealth taxation is to redress some of the inequality in the distribution of national wealth. Overall, the taxation of wealth is a fundamental part of a balanced tax system.

40|$|This {{research}} {{study investigated the}} relationship between educational spending and student achievement in Rhode Island public schools. School districts are plagued by a myriad of financial shortcomings. The most pronounced {{of which is the}} dependence on local property taxes. Concurrently, the state is raising the standard for student achievement expectations. Educators are clamoring for additional resources in order to comply with this lofty decree. In the past 30 years per pupil spending has practically doubled (Kafer, 2004), while test scores as measured by NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests) have not increased (Hanushek, 1989). Educators ask if increased funding will lead to improved student achievement. The literature suggests that there are unanswered questions related to the relationship among educational spending, student achievement, community wealth, demographics, and effort to support learning. The overall research question addressed in this study is: 2 ̆ 2 Is there a relationship between educational spending and student achievement? 2 ̆ 2 The population includes the 31 school districts that have public high schools in the state of Rhode Island. There are 42 public high schools included in this study. The research design was quantitative, ex post facto. Five variables were quantified: achievement (i. e., proficiency on grade 10 assessments), educational spending (i. e., total district expenditures per pupil), educational effort (i. e., extent to which a district is taxed in relation {{to the rest of the}} state), wealth (i. e., amount of <b>taxable</b> property <b>wealth),</b> demographic setting (i. e., dividing the districts into three categories: urban, urban ring and suburban). Data was analyzed utilizing a Pearson-Product-Moment Correlation, a 1 -way ANOVA, and a multiple regression analysis. Findings indicate that there was no significant correlation found between spending and achievement, significant negative correlation between effort and achievement, significant positive correlation between wealth and achievement, and significant negative correlation found between wealth and effort. Also there were significant differences found between all demographic areas (urban, urban ring and suburban communities) with regard to achievement. In multiple regression of achievement within the aforementioned variables, demographics explained most of the variance and wealth (and in the case of mathematics, also spending) explained the remainder. ...|$|R

Instead, {{they are part of}} a complex “polycentric” system of governments where {{politically}} autonomous and self-ruled cities compete with one another over <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth.</b> Missing from the scholarship on metropolitan governance is an understanding of the factors driving competition among local governments. The purpose of this dissertation is to fill this gap by examining how interjurisdictional competition over economic development impacts a city’s choice of strategies for attracting business and residential investment and how those strategies affect revenue collection. First, this dissertation examines whether cities, knowing the economic development strategies of their neighboring cities, pursue similar types of businesses? Or do cities strategically target different types of businesses as a way to avoid the negative consequences of competition? Second, this dissertation explores what impact the decision to pursue similar or dissimilar businesses has on the revenue collection of local governments. Using spatial data analysis to analyze a sample of 2, 299 cities, this dissertation finds general support for both theoretical frameworks presented. Overall, the findings from both analyses provide unique insights into metropolitan governance and interjurisdictional competition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{series on}} top shares {{of income and}} wealth in Spain over the 20 th century using personal income and wealth tax return statistics, as well as employment income statistics. Top income shares are highest in the 1930 s in spite of substantial individual income tax evasion biasing down our estimates. This suggests that income inequality was much higher in the pre-civil war period than it is today. Employment income concentration was moderate in the 1960 s and 1970 s and dropped sharply from 1975 to 1977 during the transition to democracy. Top income shares have increased significantly since the mid- 1990 s due {{to an increase in}} wage income concentration and a surge in realized capital gains. Financial wealth concentration has also increased in the 1990 s but real estate prices have increased sharply as well. As real estate wealth is less concentrated than financial wealth, on net, top wealth shares have declined slightly during the period 1982 - 2002.

40|$|In Spain the {{agricultural}} cadastre was accomplished very late, and the works {{to cover all}} the territory lasted over sixty years, until the 1970 s; the North zone of the country being the latest in which the implantation took place.

This article analyses these inequalities of proportionality in the loads of the Rustic and Cattle Territorial Contribution to the agrarian contributors in the southern regions of the province of Lérida, whose transition to the cadastral taxation took place between 1956 and 1963, after more than a century of amillaramientos regime. The study reveals that in the distributions of the quota of amillaramientos, great differences existed among the municipalities located in irrigated land zones or dry land zones and lower <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth,</b> finally loading the latter contributors with a fiscal pressure that did not correspond to them. Contrary to many authors, the study shows that small proprietors were mainly favoured, followed by the great ones, and the medium ones being, the less favoured during the amillaramientos in this region...|$|E
40|$|A host {{of legal}} and related issues have been posed by the recent {{decision}} in Serrano v. Priest; a selective scanning of these issues, {{in an attempt to}} ascertain their importance and likely impact, is now necessary. In Serrano the Supreme Court of California held that to the extent existing differences in spending among school districts are caused by differences in wealth, the present scheme for financing public schools in California violates federal and state equal protection guarantees. The court further held that although school finance mechanisms may differ along many dimensions, they must respect one proscription: the quality of public education, at least as measured by spending per pupil, may not be a function of wealth other than the wealth of the state as a whole. Redundancy may be helpful here. One restatement of the court 2 ̆ 7 s holding is that Serrano requires of the state a fiscal neutrality among those agencies it creates and empowers to make different choices regarding educational spending. Another paraphrase would be that, to the extent the state allows quantities of public education to be bought by local units (whether counties, school districts, schools, or families), unit wealth must not be allowed to affect the quantity purchased. Since, as things stand, local <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth</b> per pupil is a major determinant of public school spending in almost all states, Serrano is significant; insofar as fiscal neutrality is not an elementary or unambiguous concept, the meaning of Serrano remains obscure.

40|$|My {{study of}} {{some aspects of}} {{the lives of the people}} of Spesutia Parish in Harford County, Maryland, was made {{possible}} by the discovery of three surviving documents from this area. There is a parish record listing births, marriages, and deaths from 1680 to 1790. Information about households and wealth, as well as slavery, can be learned from a census taken in 1776 and a tax list from 1783. From the parish record and census, I found data on births, and was able to estimate the birth rate. The total population grew rapidly, so there must have been significant in-migration. The number of children per family was about four. I was able to estimate the age at marriage from the parish record and census. Second marriages seemed common. There did not appear to be many single adults except for servants, and bachelors had to pay a special tax. There was little evidence of extended families in one house but many had servants. Deaths were the least frequent entry in the parish record, and, if the death entries were accurate, Spesutia had a low death rate. In 1776 there were significant numbers of blacks and whites over age fifty. Maternal and infant deaths from childbirth were not especially high. Spesutia's population of 1440 in 1776 was almost half free and half slave. Over half the households did not have any slaves. Slave owning contributed to <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth,</b> but wealth did not correlate with social and political leadership. Lastly, I compared my data with other studies of colonial Maryland, and studies of New England and the South. More demographic studies are necessary, however, before we can speak definitively about birth, death and marriage in colonial Maryland or other parts of the colonies...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} have recently abandoned or experienced {{significant reduction in}} tax rates and revenues from personal wealth and inheritance taxation. Today, Norway {{remains one of the}} few countries that still tax annual wealth and intergenerational wealth transfers. Both taxes however face a substantial opposition and their future remains uncertain. In this paper, a dynamic microsimulation model MOSART developed by Statistics Norway is used to project and discuss future revenues and distributional effects of the annual wealth and inheritance taxes in Norway between year 2010 and 2040. The main questions discussed are: what are the future revenue effects of these taxes and what effect will they have on the distribution of wealth. Different scenarios are analysed and compared. The model predicts that average <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth</b> will significantly increase within the simulation period, which results in substantial increases in revenues from both wealth and inheritance taxes. In order to measure distributional effect I look how the average wealth will change across different percentiles (10 equal size groups divided according to net amount of wealth owned) and I use Gini coefficient as a measure of wealth inequality. The simulation results show that wealth inequality measured by Gini coefficient is going to decline between 2010 and 2040. Both types of taxes have a significant contribution to overall reduction in wealth inequality in the long run. It is estimated that around 11 % of the total decrease in Gini coefficient between 2010 and 2040 under baseline scenario is due to appliance of wealth and inheritance tax. Moreover, it appears that each year higher proportion of total reduction in Gini coefficient under baseline scenario can be attributed to wealth and inheritance taxes. Furthermore, I look what impact the removal of both taxes would have on the wealthiest individuals in Norway. In a current system of capital taxation (a dual income tax) wealth tax is thought to play an important supplementary role to ensure high progressivity on top of the income and wealth distribution. In a direct sense, it appears that removal of both taxes in the long term would mainly benefit the wealthiest individuals and since a substantial amount of their total tax comes from annual wealth taxes it would significantly reduce their tax payments. The likelihood of the projection being correct under this study is however limited to the accuracy of underlying assumptions and depends on various political decisions on national and international level...|$|E
40|$|The prime {{requisite}} of {{a democratic}} country is an adequately educated people. If democracy {{is to continue to}} thrive it is essential that every child in the country be given an equal educational opportunity, regarless of the section of the country in which he happens to reside. The system of public education that has been developed in Saskatchewan, as elsewhere in Canada, provides for a division of responsibilities for the support of schools between the Province and the local community. This system, whereby educational costs are met in part by provincial funds and in part by local funds, can fulfil the prime requisite of democracy only if an equitable fiscal arrangement operates between the Province and the local community. In pioneer times, when economic resources were distributed relatively evenly and the need for an expanded educational offering was less keenly felt, the working out of an equitable fiscal arrangement between central authorities and local authorities was not a serious problem. In modern times, however, with tremendous variation in <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth</b> among communities and with an increasing public demand for an expanded program of education, the equitable support of schools has become a major concern of school administrators. If the major share of the cost of education is borne by the local community, the kind of education a child receives is determined largely by the economic resources of the community in which the child resides. Such a system of school support results in inequality of local tax burden and inequality of educational opportunity. Since education {{is the responsibility of the}} Province as a whole, the Province is obliged, therefore, to guard against such inequalities by providing fiscally weak communities with sufficient funds to ensure the offering of an adequate minimum educational program. Considerable progress has been made in Saskatchewan in equalizing educational opportunity and local tax burden. The organization of larger units of administration and the distribution of provincial funds by means of equalization grants have operated jointly to produce a greater degree of equality. However, true equalization of educational opportunity and local tax burden can be achieved only the implementation of a plan of provincial support based upon the following requirements: (a) a minimum or foundation program defensible before the people of the Province as a whole, (b) the objective measurement of local ability to pay, (c) the objective measurement of local educational need, and (d) a uniform local effort. The problems associated with the development of such a plan can be solved only through a complete investigation of school finances throughout the Province. The study here reported was an attempt to solve these problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The project was {{an investigation into the}} nature of social and economic change during the transition from the late medieval to early modern periods. This was achieved through a detailed study of urban and rural areas of western Berkshire between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The project aimed to identify criteria with which to measure the experience of change in the late medieval economy and society. The criteria were divided into four categories: <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth,</b> population, landholding and trade. The data were collected at two levels: a regional study employing fiscal records; and studies of the town of Newbury and the rural parishes of Buckland, Kintbury, Shaw and West Hanney that utilised a variety of documentary sources. Main Topics : There are two types of data in this study: fiscal data for west Berkshire drawn from national taxation records, and manorial data accumulated for geographical case studies. The fiscal data for west Berkshire were collected to measure change in the relative distribution of wealth between the different regions within west Berkshire and within their populations. Change {{in the size of the}} population was calculated by the differences in the numbers of men assessed in 1381 and 1522. The manorial data were collected to create biographies of people and land, and to identify the activities of the manorial court. Other additional sources, especially probate wills and inventories, were included so that networks of contacts with other people and their economic and social context could be identified. West Hanney The lands of West Hanney parish were divided between three manors and the rectory. The data are derived from the manorial records of Priors Court manor held by New College Oxford (New College Archive), Seymours Court manor held by the Eyston family of East Hendred for most of the period of study (Berkshire Record Office), and probate wills and inventories for West Hanney parish (Berkshire Record Office). The detailed data entries are divided into thematic tables that include: the name of the person and their personal details, cases of presentment in the manor court, cases relating to the lands of the manors, bequests made in the wills, and summary description of the inventory contents. Shaw The manor of Shaw was held by Winchester College between 1404 and 1543 when it was exchanged with the king who held it until 1552, and finally it was sold to Thomas Dolman, a Newbury clothier in 1554. The data are similar to those gathered for West Hanney in provenance. Newbury Data for the town of Newbury includes: information drawn from testamentary sources; brokage payments; and parish registers. Buckland The data for Buckland were collected to provide information on persons, land, the activities of the manor court, and the economy as revealed from probate inventories. The lands of Buckland were divided between the manors of Duke's, St Johns, and the rectory, and in addition there were the hamlets of Barcote, Carswell and Newton. The data are derived from the documents of the manor of Duke's held at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and the probate material for the whole parish held at the Berkshire Record Office and the Public Record Office. Kintbury The lands of Kintbury were divided north and south of the river Kennet. The nuns of Amesbury held those lands north of the river, some land near the church, and its advowson. The lands to the south of the river were more subdivided as the nuns of Nuneaton held the main manor of Kintbury Eaton or Holt, but there were additional, smaller, manors that included Templeton, Titcombe, Inglewood, Anvilles. The data are derived from the documents of the manor of Kintbury Eaton or Holt, the probate records for the whole parish before 1600, and fiscal data for the parish for 1522 and 1524...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} and specific recommendations for financing construction of primary school facilities in the Republic of Kenya. Due to implementation of universal primary school education in Kenya, there was need to accelerate construction of primary school facilities. Based on resources and procedures utilized for raising money for financing school construction, it was determined there would not be enough funds available to meet the increasing demand for primary school facilities. To develop guidelines and recommendations, two instruments in the form of questionnaires were designed and sent to selected District Commissioners and Headmasters involved in construction of primary school facilities in Kenya. The responses recorded on the questionnaires returned to the United States were analyzed. Another source of information were the Annual Reports from District Education Officers compiled by the Ministry of Education in Kenya. Three volumes of the Annual Reports were mailed to the United States and were analyzed. In the review of related literature, the methods and procedures for financing public school facilities in eleven countries across the continents of Africa, Asia, North and South America were analyzed. The major findings of the study were: 1. Seventy-four per cent of the families with children en rolled in primary schools paid the cost of the construction of primary schools. 2. Eighty-four per: cent of the Headmasters reported children of primary school age were not in school because parents were unable to pay fees. 3. Forty-eight per cent of the Headmasters reported that all school age children in the district could not be in existing school facilities. 4. Finance, labor, and transportation were listed as major problems encountered in the construction of primary school buildings. 5. Headmasters in 10 of the 19 primary schools suggested taxation as a means for securing additional revenue for the construction of primary school buildings. 6. Fifty-nine per cent of the District Education Officers in 1970; 83 per cent of the District Education Officers in 1971; and, 66 per cent of the District Education officers in 1972 reported school buildings and classrooms were inadequate. 7. The national government of each of the 5 African countries was listed as a source of financing school construction. 8. State or provincial governments provided some form of financial aid for school construction in the United States, the Republic of China, and Mexico. 9. National governments provided for school construction in Egypt and Israel. 10. The national government of New Zealand paid the total cost of school construction in local districts. 11. Ninety-eight per cent of school building construction in the United States has been financed by the taxation of property in the local school district. 12. The issuance of bonds, by local school districts for school construction in the United States, has been universal in 49 of the 50 states. The major conclusions were: 1. Universal primary education has been accepted as a goal to be achieved in many of the developing nations of the world. 2. It is essential that the national legislative body pass appropriate measures or laws which commit the nation and its resources to achieving universal primary education. 3. Sufficient money must be appropriated by the national government to provide substantial assistance to local school communities in need of new primary school facilities. 4. An equitable taxing structure must be established so that regional, district or local school community taxpayers will provide some funds to help finance needed school building programs. 5. The establishment of a system which would permit regional areas, districts, or communities to issue general obligation bonds against the <b>taxable</b> <b>wealth</b> of the unit is needed in order to secure local share of funds to finance needed primary schools.
