5|$|The Iazyges' <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was {{extremely}} important to their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the concessions offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges to move through Dacia and <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> the Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> the Pontic Steppe.|$|E

An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty. Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E

Egypt relied on <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, {{which had to be}} imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> partners outside the inner Balkans.
