40|$|AbstractThis article {{investigates the}} role of child {{temperament}} and mother's personality in maternal relation <b>to</b> <b>child.</b> Basing on theoretical ideas and empirical evidences we proposed that parental personality is associated with parenting directly but this association also interacts with child temperament. Mother's (N= 110) completed EPI to assess extraversion and neuroticism. Mother's relation <b>to</b> <b>child</b> was assessed with the Parent-child interaction questionnaire on five subscales: Positive relation <b>to</b> <b>child,</b> Control, Mildness, Consistency and Confidence. Child temperament was rated by mothers using the Carey Temperament Questionnaire. According to the results obtained a mother's neuroticism and extraversion don’t predict the relation <b>to</b> <b>child.</b> Child temperament plays a more important role: Adaptability and Quality of mood are predictors for most mother's relations <b>to</b> <b>child</b> characteristics. Together Threshold of responsiveness and Distractibility predict mother's Control. Results {{of this study are}} generally consistent with those outlining the influence of infant temperament on parent relation <b>to</b> <b>child...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Prevalence of ear health {{problems}} is common among school children. Students {{have the potential}} for changing the health scenario of the society if properly groomed and educated for healthful living. Several innovative approaches for health education like <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>child</b> programme have been tried in various health related situations to gain interest, support, involvement and commitment of students. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of health education in improving the knowledge of school children regarding ear health and to compare the effect of the <b>Child</b> <b>to</b> <b>Child</b> approach for health education with the Adult <b>to</b> <b>Child</b> approach. Methods: 212 students from the 2 classes were randomly divided into 2 groups. 4 <b>children</b> were trained <b>to</b> provide health education. 105 students were educated using the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>child</b> approach of health education while 107 were educated using the adult <b>to</b> <b>child</b> approach. Knowledge was tested pre and post intervention using a pretested closed ended questionnaire. Results: The overall pretest mean score of 4. 91 ± 1. 29 increased significantly after health education to a mean posttest score of 6. 89 ± 1. 84 (p< 0. 001). A significant improvement in mean scores after the health education within both the groups was seen (<b>Child</b> <b>to</b> <b>child</b> 4. 94 ± 1. 29 Vs 7. 01 ± 1. 85, Adult <b>to</b> <b>child</b> 2 : 4. 89 ± 1. 30 Vs 6. 76 ± 1. 83, p< 0. 001). Mean pretest and post test scores of the two groups were similar. Conclusion: The study showed that children are as effective as adults for the dissemination of knowledge <b>to</b> other <b>children</b> and can be effective change agents in ear health...|$|R

In addition, I examined whether the link between maternal attachment and maternal responses <b>to</b> <b>child</b> distress was mediated by maternal negative attribution biases about infant distress and maternal electrodermal reactivity in the context of infant distress. Path analyses revealed that (a) maternal attachment-related anxiety was positively related to maternal distress reactions <b>to</b> <b>child</b> distress, (b) that maternal negative attribution biases were negatively related to supportive maternal responses, and (c) that maternal electrodermal reactivity was positively linked with unsupportive maternal responses. These findings advance the literature on the maternal characteristics associated with supportive and unsupportive maternal responses <b>to</b> <b>child</b> distress...|$|R
