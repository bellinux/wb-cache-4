500|$|... "The D'oh-cial Network" [...] {{was written}} by J. Stewart Burns and {{directed}} by Chris Clements {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–2012). It was the second episode written by Burns that season, the first being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed". According to Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club, the episode satirizes the phenomenon of the social networking website Facebook. He commented that [...] "the thrust of the satire can be summed up with the age-old cry of parents to their offspring to put <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> thing down and go outside already." [...] Childs added that the episode points out [...] "the most blatant of the many faults of Facebook—namely, its hypnotic ability to distract people in a semi-narcissistic haze [...] ".|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of November 30, Rangel {{was part of a}} {{retreating}} vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces. [...] In the subzero cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell. [...] He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus. [...] Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. [...] There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner, but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: [...] "From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better {{on the other side of}} <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> mountain." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with V, Cyrus and producer Pharrell Williams revealed that they considered servicing [...] "#GetItRight" [...] as the lead single from the record, though [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] was ultimately chosen. [...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like I got no panties on / I wish that I could feel ya / Now hurry, hang up <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> phone!'" [...] address the desire of an [...] "absent lover". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that its production was similar to that of [...] "Starships" [...] by Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "Whoever shows {{up as the}} next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them. Only Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, played by Joan Collins on Dynasty, and Angela Channing, portrayed by Jane Wyman on [...] Falcon Crest, rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing. God I miss <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> Cul-de-Sac!" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] with 8.5 out of 10, {{an indication of}} a [...] "great" [...] episode. While he criticized the episode's [...] "mystery-of-the-week" [...] for detracting from the episode's other storylines, Isler thought it improved when it began depicting Walter's investigation of September. Other stated highlights of the episode included Noble's performance and the reappearance of the beacon from an early first season episode, the latter of which he noted, [...] "Fans have been wondering for years what <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> thing was and how it played into the story." [...] Isler concluded by observing that the story became [...] "a little sappy" [...] but was useful in [...] "neatly" [...] resolving the [...] "is he or isn't he?' drama that marked this season {{and set up the}} show to move onto the bigger task of crafting what could be the end of everything Fringe." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times was pleased that little was revealed of the villain's backstory, but believed the episode really improved once it focused on Peter exploring September's apartment. Like Isler, Hanson was happy to see the beacon again, explaining that he [...] "love any time Fringe reaches back to the crazy science of Season One." ...|$|E

500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, {{and we were going}} to hit him high and low. We were going to knock the hell out of him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] rating, {{noting that the}} episode had [...] "a handful of {{excellent}} moments (the mind-meld, <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> booth) that don't fit {{as well as they}} should". Handlen noted Kirk and Noel's relationship as the plot's [...] "weakest element", and that Adams did not make a compelling villain. On the other hand, he felt that Nimoy made Spock's mind meld sequence [...] "fairly effective". The booth and its effect on Adams were also cited as memorable moments in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|In the early-mid-1990s, country {{western music}} was {{influenced}} by the popularity of line dancing. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins was quoted as saying, [...] "The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> line dancing." [...] By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as Don Williams and George Jones who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 as these new artists rose to prominence.|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album 3 out of 5 stars upon release, criticizing the interspersed narrative tracks, stating [...] "It's the superfluous wordage – the intrusive spoken monologues, the jury-rigged cybernoir narrative, the overelaborate characterizations – <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> near sink the record." [...] However, they generally praised the music, saying that it's [...] "arguably {{his best work}} since the '70s" [...] and that the music is [...] "a potent collection of avant-garage riffs and rhythm notions." [...] They went on to appreciate Bowie's lyrics as [...] "smart," [...] "effective," [...] and [...] "sly" [...] especially on the songs [...] "I Have Not Been to Oxford Town" [...] and [...] "A Small Plot of Land." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Parsons Cook, {{a sickly}} {{young man with}} an {{inherited}} fortune of £12,000, {{was a friend of}} Palmer. In November 1855, the pair attended the Shrewsbury Handicap Stakes and bet on various horses between 13 and 15 November. Cook won £3,000 by betting on [...] "Polestar"; Palmer lost heavily by betting instead on [...] "the Chicken". Cook and Palmer had a celebration party at the Raven, a local drinking establishment. Already on 14 November, Cook was complaining that his brandy had burnt his throat; Palmer responded by making a scene in which he attempted to convince bemused onlookers that there was nothing untoward in Cook's glass. Afterwards Cook was violently sick, and told two friends, George Herring and Ishmael Fisher, that [...] "I believe <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> Palmer has been dosing me". On 15 November, Palmer and Cook returned to Rugeley, at which point Cook booked a room at the Talbot Arms.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, {{this time}} as a jazz and blues singer, on Strange Weather, also {{produced}} by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of [...] "As Tears Go By" [...] for Strange Weather, this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. [...] "I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with <b>that</b> <b>damn</b> song," [...] she told Jay Cocks in Time magazine, but she came {{to terms with it}} as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of Vogue, Faithfull declared, [...] "forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen." [...] The album of covers was produced by Hal Willner after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of 20th-century music. They chose to record such diverse tracks as Bob Dylan's [...] "I'll Keep It with Mine" [...] and [...] "Yesterdays", written by Broadway composers Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith; Tom Waits wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.|$|E
