5|$|Working {{alongside}} the professional crew were over 800 volunteers; some were production arts students from British drama schools.

5|$|Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> was the Empire Pool, which {{hosted the}} Olympic aquatic events {{and was the}} first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length. Due to lack of space, the pool was covered over so that boxing events could take place. The blackout paint which covered all of the venue windows – still remaining from the Second World War – {{had to be removed}} before the Games. The Olympics were the last event to make use of this pool, before it was concreted over.|$|E
5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand.

5|$|Any future {{renovation}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> {{will involve}} replacing the old North Stand {{of the former}} National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing stands of the new Millennium Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E
5|$|As {{for every}} match in the 2010–11 FA Cup, {{the ball for}} the final was {{provided}} by Nike-owned, Manchester-based sports equipment company Umbro.

25|$|Other renovations in {{that year}} {{included}} {{the addition of a}} 1,080 foot (329 meter) long LED display <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium's</b> upper deck, primarily for advertising purposes.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{demolition}} and {{reconstruction of the}} 5,000 seat Varsity Stadium at the University of Toronto, the Argos returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium,</b> hosting preseason games from 2013 to 2015.

The following year, some supporters were displeased when further banners were added over the glass block-walled staircase towers {{on either side}} of the main stand leading up to the Club Deck; the banners were removed within a few months, with the club stating it was a marketing exercise to highlight the potential of the staircases as advertising space.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011, CoMS {{was renamed}} the Etihad Stadium, {{sponsored}} by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and Aabar {{to gain the}} stadium naming rights. The lucrative ten-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> itself but to the whole £200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, {{now known as the}} City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> and which would include a 7,000 capacity mini-stadium plus fifteen additional outdoor football pitches, six swimming pools and three gyms. The planned CFA facility was not only to become the new home base of the Manchester City first team squad, reserve (under-21 youth) team squad, and all of the Academy younger age group squads, but also the new home of the prior loosely affiliated Manchester City Ladies team (which was re-branded in 2012 as Manchester City Women's F.C. and more formally merged into the Manchester City family of affiliated football teams). Also fully integrated into the new CFA facility would be the parent club's world headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stadion {{served as}} the home ground of {{association}} football club Malmö FF between 1958 and 2008. The team moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> on its opening in 1958, leaving its original home ground at Malmö IP to do so. The first Malmö FF match at the new ground was played on 8 August 1958; in an Allsvenskan fixture, Malmö FF took on their cross-town rivals, IFK Malmö, who had also moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> from Malmö IP. Played in front of 17,368 fans, the game ended with a 4–4 draw. IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan in 1962, and have not returned to the first tier since, but the club continues to play at Malmö Stadion nonetheless. Malmö FF experienced an average attendance of around 13,000 for the first ten years at the stadium; average crowds then dropped to below 10,000 {{by the end of}} the 1970s. By the 1990s, attendances were at an all-time low, with less than 5,000 people on average coming to Malmö FF matches. The club therefore let Malmö Stadion for the newly renovated Malmö IP in 1999, IFK Malmö followed in August the same year. By this time IFK Malmö were playing in Division 2, then the third tier in the Swedish league system. During their seasons in Allsvenskan, IFK Malmö had attracted an average attendance of around 10,000 spectators between 1957–58 and 1962. IFK Malmö's attendance at Malmö Stadion reached its peak during the 1960 season when the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan and attracted 12,787 spectators on average <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadium.</b> The attendance had decreased to around 1,000 spectators per match in 1999 when the club had dropped in the league.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 February 1998, ASPA sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IPPAR an {{official}} request <b>to</b> classify <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> as national patrimony, {{resulting in the}} opening of a process on 17 February 2006. This was after the opening of Estádio Municipal de Braga in 2003 (for the UEFA Euro 2004), leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stadiums</b> repurposing for athletics competitions and amateur football competitions, including the youth of S.C. Braga. At that time, the field was repaired and renovation of the drainage systems. [...] By 15 April 2011 a proposal was made <b>to</b> include <b>the</b> <b>stadium</b> within a Special Protection Zone by the DRCNorte.
