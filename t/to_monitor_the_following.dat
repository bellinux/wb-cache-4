40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Introduction Earlier {{studies have}} shown the {{popularity}} of herbal products among people as traditional, complementary or alternative medication. One of the major clinical risks in the concomitant administration of herbal products and prescription medicine is pharmacokinetic herb-drug interaction (HDI). This is {{brought about by the}} ability of phytochemicals to inhibit or induce the activity of metabolic enzymes and transport proteins. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of the crude extracts of popular medicinal herbs used in South Africa to inhibit major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes and transport proteins through in vitro assessment. Methods Medicinal herbs were obtained from traditional medical practitioners and 15 were selected for this study. The selected herbal products were extracted and incubated with human liver microsomes <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> reactions as markers for the metabolic activities of the respective CYP: phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP 1 A 2), diclofenac 4 ‟-hydroxylation (CYP 2 C 9), S-mephenytoin 4 ‟- hydroxylation (CYP 2 C 19) and testosterone 6 β-hydroxylation (CYP 3 A 4). In addition, the influence of Lessertia frutescens (formerly Sutherlandia frutescens) and Hypoxis hemerocallidea was investigated on more isozymes: coumarin 7 -hydroxylation (CYP 2 A 6), bupropion hydroxylation (CYP 2 B 6), paclitaxel 6 α-hydroxylation (CYP 2 C 8), bufuralol 1 ‟-hydroxylation (CYP 2 D 6), chlorzoxazone 6 - hydroxylation (CYP 2 E 1) and midazolam 1 ‟-hydroxylation (CYP 3 A 4 / 5). The generation of the CYPspecific substrates/metabolites were monitored and quantified with the aid of LC-MS/MS. The metabolic clearance of midazolam using cryopreserved hepatocytes was monitored in the presence of Lessertia frutescens and Hypoxis hemerocallidea. The potential of both to inhibit human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity was assessed using recombinant MDCKII and LLC-PK 1 cells overexpressing human breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and human P-glycoprotein (P-gp), respectively. Similarly, the potential for interactions with human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3) was assessed using recombinant HEK 293 cells over-expressing OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 3, respectively. Results Bowiea volubilis, Kedrostis Africana, Chenopodium album, Lessertia frutescens (methanolic extract), Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Spirostachys africana and Lessertia frutescens (aqueous extract), in ascending order of potency demonstrated strong inhibition of CYP 1 A 2 activity (IC 50 = 1 - 100 g/mL). Similarly, Emex australis, Alepidea amatymbica, Pachycarpus concolor, Lessertia frutescens, Capparis sepiaria, Kedrostis africana and Pentanisia prunelloides inhibited CYP 2 C 9 with IC 50 less than 100 g/mL. The following demonstrated strong inhibition of CYP 2 C 19 with IC 50 values less than 100 g/mL: Acacia karroo, Capparis sepiaria, Chenopodium album, Pachycarpus concolor, Ranunculus multifidus, Lessertia frutescens and Zantedeschia aethiopica. CYP 3 A 4 was inhibited by Lessertia frutescens, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Spirostachys Africana, Bowiea volubilis, Zantedeschia aethiopica, Chenopodium album, Kedrostis Africana, Acacia karroo, Emex australis, Pachycarpus concolor, Ranunculus multifidus, Capparis sepiaria and Pentanisia prunelloides. Time-dependent (irreversible) inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 / 5 (KI = 296 μg/mL, kinact = 0. 063 min- 1) and delay in the production of midazolam metabolites in the human hepatocytes, leading to a 40 % decreased midazolam upscaled in vivo clearance, was observed with Lessertia frutescens. Further, Lessertia frutescence inhibited the activity of P-gp (IC 50 = 324. 8 μg/mL), OATP 1 B 1 (IC 50 = 10. 4 μg/mL) and OATP 1 B 3 (IC 50 = 6. 6 μg/mL). Hypoxis hemerocallidea inhibited the activity of OATP 1 B 1 (IC 50 = 118. 7 μg/mL) and OATP 1 B 3 (IC 50 = 290. 1 μg/mL) with no potent inhibitory effects on P-gp. None of the two inhibited the activity of BCRP within the tested concentrations. Conclusion The result indicates the potential for HDI between the selected medicinal herbs and the substrates of the enzymes investigated in this study, if sufficient in vivo concentrations are achieved. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Inleiding Vroeëre studies het aangedui dat die gebruik van plantaardige produkte as tradisionele, aanvullende en alternatiewe medikasie baie gewild is. Een van die grootste kliniese risiko‟s geassosieer met die gelyktydige gebruik van plantaardige produkte met voorskrifmedikasie is farmakokinetiese kruiegeneesmiddel interaksies (HDI). Hierdie interaksies word veroorsaak deur die vermoë van plantchemikalieë om die aktiwiteit van metaboliese ensieme en transportproteïene te inhibeer of te induseer. Die doel van hierdie studie is om ondersoek in te stel na die moontlikheid van onsuiwer ekstrakte van gewilde Suid-Afrikaanse medisinale kruie om die belangrikste sitochroom P 450 (CYP) - ensieme en transportproteïene te inhibeer. Hierdie ondersoek sal plaasvind deur middel van in vitrostudies. Metodes Medisinale kruie is verkry vanaf tradisionele genesers, waaruit ŉ totaal van 15 kruie geselekteer is vir gebruik tydens hierdie studie. Die geselekteerde kruie is geëkstraheer en met menslike lewermikrosome geïnkubeer om die volgende reaksies as merkers vir die metaboliese aktiwiteit van die onderskeie CYP-ensieme te moniteer: fenasetien-O-deëtilasie (CYP 1 A 2), diklofenak- 4 ‟- hidroksilasie (CYP 2 C 9), S-mefenitoïen- 4 ‟-hidroksilasie (CYP 2 C 19) en testosteroon- 6 β-hidroksilasie (CYP 3 A 4). Afgesien van die voorafgaande, is ook die invloed van Lessertia frutescens en Hypoxis hemerocallidea op verskeie ander iso-ensieme ondersoek. Hierdie iso-ensieme is soos volg: koumarien- 7 -hidroksilasie (CYP 2 A 6), bupropioonhidroksilasie (CYP 2 B 6), paklitaksiel- 6 α-hidroksilasie (CYP 2 C 8), bufuralol- 1 ‟-hidroksilasie (CYP 2 D 6), chloorsoksasoon- 6 -hidroksilasie (CYP 2 E 1) en midasolaam- 1 ‟- hidroksilasie (CYP 3 A 4 / 5). Die produksie van CYP-spesifieke substrate/metaboliete is gemoniteer en deur middel van LC-MS/MS-analises gekwantifiseer. Die metaboliese opruiming van midasolaam deur middel van krio-gepreserveerde hepatosiete is gemoniteer in die teenwoordigheid van Lessertia frutescens en Hypoxis hemerocallidea. Die moontlikheid van beide om menslike ATPbindingskasset (ABC) -transporteerderaktiwiteit te inhibeer is bepaal deur die gebruik van rekombinante MDCKII- en LLC-PK 1 -selle wat onderskeidelik menslike borskanker-weerstandige proteïen (BCRP) en menslike P-glikoproteïen (P-gp) potensieel. Op ŉ soortgelyke wyse is die moontlikheid vir interaksies met menslike organiese anion-transportpolipeptiede (OATP 1 B 1 en OATP 1 B 3) bepaal deur rekombinante HEK 293 -selle te gebruik wat onderskeidelik OATP 1 B 1 en OATP 1 B 3 potensieel. Resultate Bowiea volubilis, Kedrostis Africana, Chenopodium album, Lessertia frutescens (metanol-ekstrak), Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Spirostachys africana en Lessertia frutescens (water-ekstrak), in toenemende potensie, het sterk inhibisie van CYP 1 A 2 -aktiwiteit (IC 50 = 1 - 100 g/mL) getoon. In ooreenstemming met die voorafgaande resultate het Emex australis, Alepidea amatymbica, Pachycarpus concolor, Lessertia frutescens, Capparis sepiaria, Kedrostis africana en Pentanisia prunelloides CYP 2 C 9 met IC 50 –waardes van minder as 100 g/mL geïnhibeer. Die volgende het sterk inhibisie van CYP 2 C 19 met IC 50 -waardes van minder as 100 g/mL getoon: Acacia karroo, Capparis sepiaria, Chenopodium album, Pachycarpus concolor, Ranunculus multifidus, Lessertia frutescens en Zantedeschia aethiopica. CYP 3 A 4 is deur Lessertia frutescens, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Spirostachys Africana, Bowiea volubilis, Zantedeschia aethiopica, Chenopodium album, Kedrostis Africana, Acacia karroo, Emex australis, Pachycarpus concolor, Ranunculus multifidus, Capparis sepiaria en Pentanisia prunelloides geïnhibeer. Tydafhanklike (onomkeerbare) inhibisie van CYP 3 A 4 / 5 (KI = 296 μg/mL, kinact = 0. 063 min- 1) en vertraging in die produksie van midasolaammetaboliete in menslike hepatosiete wat aanleiding gee tot ŉ 40 % afname in midasolaam bepaal in vivo opruiming, is waargeneem met Lessertia frutescens. Lessertia frutescens het ook die aktiwiteit van P-gp (IC 50 = 324. 8 μg/mL), OATP 1 B 1 (IC 50 = 10. 4 μg/mL) en OATP 1 B 3 (IC 50 = 6. 6 μg/mL) geïnhibeer. Hypoxis hemerocallidea het die aktiwiteit van OATP 1 B 1 (IC 50 = 118. 7 μg/mL) en OATP 1 B 3 (IC 50 = 290. 1 μg/mL) geïnhibeer met geen betekenisvolle effekte op P-gp nie. Geen een van die twee het die aktiwiteit van BCRP geïnhibeer binne die konsentrasies waarin getoets is nie. Gevolgtrekking Die resultate van hierdie studie dui aan dat wanneer voldoende in vivo-konsentrasies bereik word, die moontlikheid vir kruie-geneesmiddel interaksies tussen die geselekteerde medisinale kruie en ensiemsubstrate ŉ werklikheid word...|$|E

40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} fields (EMFs) are invisible {{lines of force}} that surround any electrical device, including power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical equipment. Electric fields are produced by voltage and increase in strength as the voltage increases. Magnetic fields result from the flow of current through wires and or electrical devices and increase in strength as the current increases. Most electrical equipment has to be turned on for a magnetic field to be produced, but electric fields are present even when equipment is switched off {{as long as it}} is connected to an electric power source. Electric fields are weakened or shielded by materials that conduct electricity (including human skin). Magnetic fields, on the other hand, pass through most materials and are therefore more difficult to shield and of greater concern.

40|$|Abstract Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} worldwide with no treatment for the chronic phase available. Interestingly, an endogenous repair program comprising inflammation and neurogenesis is known to modulate stroke outcome. Several studies have shown that neurogenesis decreases with age but the therapeutic importance of endogenous neurogenesis for recovery from cerebral diseases has been indicated as its ablation leads to stroke aggravation and worsened outcome. A detailed characterization of the neurogenic response after stroke related to ageing would help to develop novel and targeted therapies. In an innovative approach, we used the DCX-Luc mouse, a transgenic model expressing luciferase in doublecortin-positive neuroblasts, <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> neurogenic response <b>following</b> middle cerebral artery occlusion over three weeks in three age groups (2, 6, 12 months) by optical imaging while the stroke lesion was monitored by quantitative MRI. The individual longitudinal and noninvasive time profiles provided exclusive insight into age-dependent decrease in basal neurogenesis and neurogenic upregulation in response to stroke which are not accessible by conventional BrdU-based measures of cell proliferation. For cortico-striatal strokes the maximal upregulation occurred at 4 days post stroke followed by a continuous decrease to basal levels by three weeks post stroke. Older animals effectively compensated for reduced basal neurogenesis by an enhanced sensitivity to the cerebral lesion, resulting in upregulated neurogenesis levels approaching those measured in young mice. In middle aged and older mice, but not in the youngest ones, additional upregulation of neurogenesis was observed in the contralateral healthy hemisphere. This further substantiates the increased propensity of older brains to respond to lesion situation. Our results clearly support the therapeutic relevance of endogenous neurogenesis for stroke recovery and particularly in older brains...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in mid- 2002, a large {{tuberculosis}} outbreak occurred among homeless {{persons in}} King County, Washington. In order <b>to</b> further <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> outbreak <b>following</b> {{its peak in}} 2003, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all new King County tuberculosis (TB) patients in 2004 and {{the first half of}} 2005 (n = 220) were genotyped by using a rapid comparative genomics-based (genomic deletion-typing) approach, with confirmation by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units and repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). Results were compared to retrospective genotypic data from 1995 to 2003. The outbreak strain SBRI 9, which was not seen among King County homeless persons prior to 2002, accounted for 16 out of 30 TB cases (53 %) within this population in 2002. This trend continued with 27 out of 35 cases (77 %) caused by the outbreak strain in 2003, 11 out of 13 cases (85 %) caused by the outbreak strain in 2004, and 4 out of 10 cases (40 %) caused by the outbreak strain in the first 5 months of 2005. Thus, the outbreak strain remained well established within this homeless population throughout the study period. At least four SBRI 9 cases were in people who had previously been infected by other strains. The novel PCR-based strain-typing approach used in this investigation proved to be cost-effective and very rapid. In most cases, it was possible to analyze DNA extracted directly from primary isolation (Mycobacterium growth indicator tube) cultures submitted by clinical laboratories, a feature that markedly reduced the delay between diagnosis and strain typing results. This rapid turnaround facilitated public health efforts to prevent new outbreaks involving this strain...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The serum IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio has {{previously}} been demonstrated to be a clinical marker of periodontitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment on the serum IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio. Materials and methods: Forty chronic periodontitis patients completed this study and received periodontal treatment comprising scaling and root planing plus ultrasonic debridement. Clinical data were recorded at baseline, 6 weeks (R 1) after treatment completion (full-mouth or quadrant-scaling and root planing) and 25 weeks after baseline (R 2). Serum samples were taken at each time point and cytokines concentrations determined by ELISA. Results: Following treatment, statistically significant reductions were noted in clinical parameters. However, IL- 17 A and IL- 17 E concentrations were significantly greater than baseline values before- and after-adjusting for smoking. The IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio was lower at R 1 and R 2. Serum IL- 6 and TNF levels were significantly lower at R 1 only. Also exclusively at R 1, serum IL- 17 A and IL- 17 E correlated positively with clinical parameters, while the IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio correlated negatively with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment. Conclusion: Increased serum IL- 17 E and a reduced IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio may be indicative and/or a consequence of periodontal therapy. Therefore, the role of IL- 17 E in periodontal disease progression and the healing process is worthy of further investigation. Clinical relevance: IL- 17 E may be a valuable biomarker <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> healing process <b>following</b> periodontal treatment as increased IL- 17 E levels and a reduced IL- 17 A:IL- 17 E ratio could reflect clinical improvements post-therapy. Therefore, monitoring serum IL- 17 E might be useful to identify individuals who require additional periodontal treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the active microbial (bacterial and fungal) soil community in an arable wheat field subjected to different management practices was examined at five times during a 1 -year period. Field sections were fertilized either at good agricultural practice (GAP) levels or at reduced levels (0. 5 × GAP) and were inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) at the same time. Field subsections were treated either with or without pesticides. Changes in the active microbial communities were investigated by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} analysis of reverse transcription-PCR-amplified 16 S and 18 S rRNA. Microbial community structure was primarily determined by season, and the seasonal trends were similar for the fungal and bacterial components. Between-sample microbial heterogeneity decreased under a mature crop in the summer but increased following harvesting and plowing. Although similar overall trends were seen for the two microbial components, sample variability was greater for the fungal community than for the bacterial community. The greatest management effects were due to GAP fertilization, which caused increases in the bacterial numbers in the total and culturable communities. Microbial biomass similarly increased. GAP fertilization also caused large shifts in both the active bacterial community structure and the active fungal community structure and additionally resulted in a decrease in the heterogeneity of the active bacterial community. Pesticide addition did not significantly affect bacterial numbers or heterogeneity, but it led to major shifts in the active soil bacterial community structure. PCR primers specific for Glomales 25 S rRNA genes were used <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> VAM population <b>following</b> inoculation. Glomales were detected initially only in VAM-inoculated field sections but were subsequently detected in noninoculated field sections as the season progressed. After plowing, the level of Glomales was reduced in noninoculated field sections but remained high in VAM-inoculated field sections. Inoculation of VAM correlated with elevated soil phosphate and carbon levels...|$|R

A total of 16, 10 x 10 m plots were established in pig disturbed areas <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> vegetation changes <b>following</b> removal of pigs from 'Ola'a-Koa Rain Forest Unit in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Native understory cover increased 48 % from 1991 to 1998, largely {{in the first two years}} following pig removal from the area. Understory ferns made the largest gains followed by tree ferns and native woody species. A flush of seedlings and saplings of subcanopy native trees observed after pig removal may potentially increases tree canopy cover in the future. Alien understory vegetation increased 190 % throughout the seven year study. Almost all alien plant cover increases resulted from the expansion in cover of three very aggressive species, kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipiticus), and palm grass (Setaria palmaefolia). These species are able to successfully establish independent of pig activity and are spreading in spite of pig control, not because of it. For other alien species, the greater competition and shade environment created from increased numbers of native trees, tree ferns, and understory plants, along with the lack of physical disturbance by pigs, appear to inhibit their establishment and spread. The presence of Banana poka (Passiflora mollissima) was reduced from 81 % to 40 % in the plots. Several herbaceous weeds, Cardamine flexuosa, Hypericum mutilatum, Ludwigia palustris, that were initially present in a few plots were no longer present by the end of the study period. This study indicates the value of pig control as a first important step in the restoration of native Hawaiian rain forest. Monitoring in future years is needed to more accurately predict trends in native understory and sub-canopy tree species. Follow up alien plant control of the more disruptive species should begin as soon as possible after pig removal while these species densities are still low.
