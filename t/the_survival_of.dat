5000|$|Don Yoder {{argued that}} there were five {{separate}} ways of defining folk religion.

This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as <b>the</b> <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as <b>the</b> <b>survivals</b> <b>of</b> Medieval Catholicism. <b>The</b> second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.|$|R
