40|$|Introduction: <b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> {{with high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality rates {{are one of the}} most important problems of the world. Several factors have been described for the occurrence of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> Two of them are traffic congestion and road density which have infrequently been reported in the Turkish literature. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> population size, and the number of motor vehicles in Turkey. Material and methods: The crude data were obtained from the web page of the Turkish Statistical Institute. They was standardized for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles, or every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> The system of Statistical Regions was used in the classification. Results: In Turkey, the total number of inhabitants was 74, 724, 269 and the number of motor vehicles was 16, 089, 528 in 2011. As a result of 131, 845 road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> 3, 835 people died and 238, 074 people were injured. In the evaluation of  the distribution of the number of motor vehicles for every one million population, the distribution of the number of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population and every one million motor vehicles,  the distribution of the number of people died in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> and the distribution of the number of people injured in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> were all statistically significant. Conclusion: In the <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> urban and rural society based projects for the identification of risk factors and the preventive measures are great importance.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo analyze {{characteristics}} and causes of road crash and injuries in China from 2003 to 2005. MethodsThe data of road crash in 2003 - 2005 were collected {{to study the}} characteristics including total vehicle number, occurrence rates of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> and serious <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> so as to discuss the causes and characteristics of road crash in China. ResultsFrom 2003 to 2005, the numbers of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> injuries and deaths {{as well as the}} mortality rates per 100 000 persons and per 10 000 vehicles declined in China. Until 2005, the total number of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> decreased to 450 000 and deaths to 99 000, with the mortality rate per 10 000 vehicles being 7. 6 persons. While the drivers and passengers accounted for 33. 2 % and 26. 6 % of death casualties respectively in 2005. Most <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> were caused by drivers, especially those with driving experience less than 3 years. <b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred on suburban roads accounted for 60 %. The mortality rate of the <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> per 100 km on the first grade road ranked the highest. The mortality rate of the <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> on expressways ranked the highest, with continual increase of death and injury. ConclusionsAt present, the increase trend of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> and casualities in China has been slowed down to some extent and shows a declining tendency, but the situation is far away from being optimistic. In order to cut down the number of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> and casualties, we should pay more attention to training and managing drivers with less than three driving years and those driving buses. Strict prevention measures should be laid on <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> on first grade roads, expressways and suburban roads as well as the enhancement on improving first-aid system...|$|R
