However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit.

Within the international project Assessing <b>Time</b> <b>Use</b> Survey Datasets several potentially useful individual US <b>time</b> <b>use</b> heritage datasets have been identified for use in de-veloping an historical series of non-market accounts. In order to evaluate the series of American Heritage <b>Time</b> <b>Use</b> Data (AHTUD) (1965, 1975, 1985, 1992 - 94, 1998 - 99) this paper analyses the representativeness of this data when using given weights and provides a new harmonised calibration of the AHTUD for sound <b>time</b> <b>use</b> analyses.

40|$|Media <b>time</b> <b>use</b> is of {{particular}} importance to advertisers and other users of the media. It has been of interest to researchers from the discipline of marketing where a number of developments {{in the theory of}} <b>time</b> <b>use</b> have occurred, in particular the call for researchers to incorporate subjective measures of <b>time</b> <b>use</b> and not rely solely on objective measures of time (Hirschman, 1987). Subjective measures include personality dimensions which have been recognised as affecting media <b>time</b> <b>use</b> and the term ‘timestyle’ has been used to capture the effects of individuals’ allocation of time. As timestyle is thought to influence a consumer’s time allocation to activities (Bergadaà 1990) and to direct <b>time</b> <b>use,</b> the concept is considered important in understanding the allocation of time to activities. While subjective measures can tap into peoples’ thoughts, values and beliefs, an examination of their behaviour will reflect these subjective dimensions of the individual. Therefore capturing <b>time</b> <b>use</b> of activities that reflect personality variables such as socializing, planning orientation, past/future orientation and perceived time pressure can be <b>used</b> to examine <b>time</b> <b>use</b> behaviour. The use of objective measures as surrogates for subjective factors of <b>time</b> <b>use</b> have not been examined previously. This paper presents the findings of a study investigating the elements of timestyle based on media <b>time</b> <b>use</b> drawn from the Australian <b>time</b> <b>use</b> studies. Based on the literature, a model of timestyle that includes perceived time pressure, social time, planning orientation and past/future orientation is proposed and tested. The results provide limited support for the four elements of the timestyle construct. Implications and areas for further research are discussed...|$|R

One {{of the reasons}} for the removal of passenger tolls was the extra <b>time</b> <b>used</b> to count passengers, which increased the queues at the toll plaza, and that the company's debt would be covered anyway, even without the extra revenue. From 1 January 1981, scheduled buses were also exempt from tolls, under the condition that the funds saved were used by the bus companies to strengthen public transport on Sotra. From 1980, there was disagreement within the company as to whether the toll period should be extended to increase the subsidies to projects on Sotra and Øygarden, or if an as short as possible collection period was desirable. The board decided to terminate toll collections from 31 December 1983. A minority of the owners wanted to extend the period for another two years, which would have given an estimated additional NOK20 million.|$|E

Sources: The databases CINAHL and PubMed were searched, by combinations of terms such as: <b>time</b> <b>use,</b> <b>time</b> geography, occupational balance, occupational pattern, assessment, intervention, occupational therapy, lifestyle redesign, well-being, and mental health. Conclusions: <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> for people with psychiatric disabilities is often restricted to sleeping, eating, caring for oneself, and performing quiet activities. The target group is at risk of being both over- and under-occupied, and occupational imbalance may be regarded as an expression of the disability, thus shaped by a misfit between the person's capacities and environmental opportunities and demands.
