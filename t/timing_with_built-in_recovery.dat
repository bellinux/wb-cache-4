She can perform mechanical recovery of spilled oil <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>recovery</b> systems in open water, either by using conventional outriggers and booms in calm seas or a stiff steel boom {{and a special}} wave-dampening channel in heavy weather. The oil recovery system has been manufactured by the Finnish company Mobimar which has also provided equipment for other Finnish patrol vessels. Furthermore, the vessel is also fitted for but not with equipment capable of recovering oil in ice conditions. The internal storage tanks are dimensioned for [...] of recovered oil and [...] of recovered chemicals. The 350 m2 open aft deck is covered with tropical hardwood, Iroko. For diving support and oil recovery tasks, Turva carries a small workboat.|$|R
40|$|A parser {{generator}} producing recursive descent LL(1) parsers was implemented. The generated parsers include automatic syntactic error recovery and error reporting. The implementation language {{for both the}} {{parser generator}} and the generated parsers is Scheme. 1 Introduction Parser generators {{to be used with}} widely used languages such as C have been available for quite a few years. For some reason, similar tools for the Lisp family of languages are not widespread. The goal of this work was to implement a parser generator using Scheme [4], {{which is one of the}} most popular Lisp-like languages in use today. The parser generator, named Taurus, generates recursive descent LL(1) parsers <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> error <b>recovery</b> and error reporting. During error recovery, the continuation mechanism provided by the Scheme language is employed. 2 The Grammar Description The grammar description is a mixture of grammar rules and semantic actions. Grammar rules describe the grammar to be accepted, and semantic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{receiver}} {{that incorporates}} an all-optical clock recovery approach for synchronisation {{suitable for use}} in incoherent OCDMA transmission is demonstrated. The developed solution was implemented and tested in a multiuser environment using the 2 D-WHTS coding scheme on incoherent OCDMA transmission with 2. 5 Gbit/s data rate. The receiver <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> all-optical clock <b>recovery</b> was tested by taking the BER for the received data when synchronised with the all-optically recovered clock from the incoming OCDMA traffic and when an RF synthesiser was used to the generate the clock. Improvement of ∼ 7. 5 dBm was observed with the all-optical clock recovery approach. The related eye diagrams and the wavelength spectrum were also recorded...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn large {{commercial}} buildings facing high cooling loads, conventional heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are typically {{based on the}} use of one, or few, large-capacity air handling units (AHUs) to supply conditioned air throughout a centrally-managed air distribution network. The alternative concept of ‘decentralized’ HVAC typically entails the deployment of multiple, small capacity fan coil units (FCUs) operating as dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) and located closest to the individual thermal zones they must condition. For this study, the authors commissioned the development of a small capacity, packaged cooling coil <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> enthalpy <b>recovery</b> devices. This customised unit, intended for use in a cooling-only, decentralized DOAS configuration, includes: two rotary wheels for sensible and latent energy recovery, a single cooling coil, and both supply and exhaust fans. The unit has been intended for building air conditioning use in the Singaporean climate. This paper provides energy performance data based on laboratory testing of the unit with independent control of the following variables: outdoor air conditions, return air conditions, and chilled water flow rate. It is intended that empirical data offered by this study can be adapted for use in future building energy models of decentralized HVAC systems...|$|R
40|$|Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) have an {{important}} role in the development of the next generation mobile networks by introducing automated schemes. Cell outage detection is one of the main functionalities in self-healing mechanism. Outage detection for small cells has not been discussed in literature with greater emphasis yet. The Femtocell Collaborative Outage Detection (FCOD) algorithm <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> Sleeping Mode <b>Recovery</b> (SMR) is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm is mainly based on the femtocell collaborative detection with incorporated sniffer. It compares the current Femtocell Access Points FAPs’ Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) statistics with a benchmark data. An outage decision is autonomously taken by each FAP depending on a certain threshold value. Moreover, the FCOD algorithm is capable of differentiating between the outage and sleeping cells due to the presence of the built-in SMR technique...|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{sensitive}} {{ecology of the}} Baltic Sea, it has been agreed in the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM) that instead of using dispersants to dissolve the oil slicks, combatting the spills is based on mechanical recovery using oil booms to limit the spill and skimmers to collect the oil from the surface as quickly and completely as possible. For this purpose every Finnish pollution control vessel is equipped <b>with</b> permanently installed <b>built-in</b> <b>recovery</b> equipment and such systems have also been installed on several patrol vessels of the Finnish Border Guard. As the primary mission of the new vessel is pollution prevention, the ship has an extensive array of equipment capable of detecting and recovering spilled oil and chemicals in open water, high seas and ice conditions. Some of the equipment, such as an oil-detecting radar and a thermographic camera in the mast, are used {{for the first time}} in a Finnish oil recovery vessel. In addition the ship has a weather station and a wet laboratory capable of analyzing water samples automatically.|$|R

40|$|Combinations of {{conditional}} rewriting systems (CRSs) <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates are {{an attempt}} to make operative deduction for a subclass of the univeral Horn classes <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates and functions (in a decidable theory). CRSs <b>with</b> purely <b>built-in</b> predicates as premises has been studied widely. In this work, CRS <b>with</b> both <b>built-in</b> predicates and standard conditions (i. e., equality atoms evaluated by joinability) are investigated. A restricted subclass of universal Horn classes <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates and appropriate definitions of standard CRSs <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates in a specific theory are presented. A notion of reduction and a decision procedure for universal Horn clauses whose conditions are purely built-in are analysed. Conditions for the completeness of the procedure are studied.
