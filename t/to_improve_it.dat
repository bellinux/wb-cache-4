5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it,</b> but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it</b> far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it,</b> Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Hodgson was ranked ninth among North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He {{went on to}} be chosen tenth overall by the Vancouver Canucks. Scouting reports and former coaches {{emphasized}} Hodgson's hockey sense and character, while Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis cited his leadership as a strong factor in drafting him. After the 2007–08 season, OHL coaches had voted him the smartest player in the Eastern Conference. As his skating was considered a weakness, he spent the subsequent off-season training <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|The M2 Light Tank {{led to the}} US M3-series and M5-series light tanks. The Ordnance Department {{viewed the}} M2A4 as a stopgap tank; work <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it</b> further began in June 1940. The first M3 Stuart tanks began to be {{produced}} in March 1941; the original riveted M3s closely resembled the M2A4, and the two types occasionally served in the same units; the easiest recognition feature is the rear idler wheel. On the M2A4, the idler is raised; on the M3 it trails on the ground, increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle. The M3 retained the same Continental W-670 engine, but incorporated ½-inch thicker (1½ inch total thickness) armor; weight increased to 14 tons. The tank initially kept the same 37mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns, but the turret incorporated improvements. Eventually over 4,500 examples of all variants were produced.|$|E
5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it</b> as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwold {{reformed}} monasteries {{in his own}} {{diocese of}} Winchester, and he also helped to restore houses in eastern England, such as Peterborough, Ely, Thorney and St Neots. Almost all had been monasteries in the seventh century, and had later become communities of secular clerks or transferred to secular ownership, so he could argue {{that he was just}} restoring their original status. He also restored nunneries, working with his ally, Queen Ælfthryth. He did not merely attempt to revive the historical church, but also <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it</b> by inventing dubious pedigrees for his houses. He was the main propagandist for the movement, and wrote all the major works supporting it in England during Edgar's reign.|$|E

40|$|The {{factors that}} could be used to define, measure, and <b>improve</b> <b>IT</b> {{flexibility}} are not considered to be well-defined or understood. A theoretical framework for understanding and determining such factors is proposed in this article, which could be used by business and IT leaders to assess their IT flexibility. Organizations can use this framework, termed the IT-business equilibrium model, as a tool <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> their own <b>IT</b> flexibility as a means <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> their <b>IT</b> effectiveness and ultimately achieve sustained competitive advantage for their businesses...|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens on how <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it.</b> Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, {{and that it}} can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets {{a job as a}} blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it</b> gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry II {{the castle}} was {{adequately}} maintained, but little additional work was undertaken <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>it.</b> A castle-guard system was established, under which lands around Cambridge were granted to local lords {{on the condition}} that they provide guard forces for the castle, and the castle was primarily used to hold the sheriff's court and records. King John expanded the castle in the years before the First Barons' War of 1215 to 1217, but this work was concentrated on constructing a new hall and chamber, at the cost of £200. During the war, the rebel barons, supported by Prince Louis of France, captured much of eastern England; Cambridge Castle fell in 1216. The castle was returned to royal control after the war, but Henry III only conducted basic maintenance of the fortification. Cambridge was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in 1266. This time the town and castle held long enough to be relieved by Henry's forces, but the king reinforced the city defences with a large ditch, later known as King's Ditch.|$|E

Knight established the Knight Block (bordering Center Street and University), in addition to the Knight Mansion.|$|R
