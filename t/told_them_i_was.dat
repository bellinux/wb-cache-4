2500|$|I told [...] I {{lived in}} the virtue of that life and power that took away the {{occasion}} of all wars and I knew from whence all wars did rise, from the lust, according to James's doctrine... I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> come into the covenant of peace which was before wars and strifes were.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went to {{the bank}} across the way as soon as I arrived," [...] she said, with contemptuous directness. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going over to Hymettus and might want money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the proud}} father of ten children," [...] he replied. [...] "That seemed to stagger them, {{but only for}} a moment. They offered to take us all to the Louvre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their {{lawyer and}} the other {{official}} (can't they trust their men unless they send 'em in pairs?) <b>are</b> coming hereto-night. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> busy, as a rule, till after dinner, but they might send along the entire directorate if it eased 'em any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sure you}} did! I'd love to come, but they wouldn't let me, I know. I'm so {{sorry about the}} fight. Couldn't you make it up, and be {{pleasant}} again?" [...] asked Rosy, clasping her hands with a beseeching gesture as her bright face grew sad and serious remembering the feud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I reckon it's a fair trade. Ye see, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Californian from Solano, and hadn't {{anything}} about me of greenbacks. I had three slugs with me. Ye remember <b>them</b> slugs?" [...] (<b>I</b> did; the [...] "slug" [...] was a [...] "token" [...] issued {{in the early}} days--a hexagonal piece of gold a little over {{twice the size of}} a twenty-dollar gold piece--worth and accepted for fifty dollars.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} two men," [...] Heyst was saying, [...] "more {{affected}} by a piece of information than Jones and his secretary, who {{was back in the}} bungalow by then. They had not heard me come up. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry to intrude.|$|E
60|$|As to the {{government}} and laws among them, I <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves; only made them promise me to live in love and good neighbourhood with one another: and so I prepared to leave them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{there last}} week. And {{they were so}} interested. Two days ago Miss Patty wrote me a note asking me to call; and then she asked if I would take her gift to you. What would you wish most from Patty's Place, Anne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Clark and Captain Haskell {{started up}} the slope. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> on the ridge and knew the {{condition}} of affairs, so <b>I</b> would show <b>them</b> the way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is most {{foolish to}} have stayed out so late,' said Mr. Macrae. 'Any {{one could see}} that a storm <b>was</b> coming. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really annoyed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not going!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{at home to}} no one, and I {{thought that}} you would stay and {{entertain}} me. Sit down again, Wingrave!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lor. Well, I am {{the most}} unlucky rogue! I have been ranging {{over half the}} town; but have sprung no game. Our women are worse infidels than the Moors: I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one of the knight-errants, that {{delivered}} them from ravishment; and I think in my conscience, that is their quarrel to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{hotel is}} not luxurious {{and they have}} very crude ideas about cookery, but they tried to suit my fastidious taste when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a friend of yours," [...] Allott remarked. [...] "However, I don't suppose you are remarkably {{comfortable}} at the mine, and you can change all this when you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{came the}} news of the fire at Almaquo. It was a false report, I {{afterward}} learned, but at that time I believed the newspapers, and the blow almost deprived me of reason. In my excitement I rushed over to Wegg's farm and found the two men together, whereupon I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ruined.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{fight with}} you," [...] I cried, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{and added that}} if they would live in peace they must sooner or later join forces with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{something}} unreal!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fond of early morning rides, and I saw your light burning here from the park. Tell me--is he worse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get out? Of course I can't," [...] moaned {{the unknown}} female bitterly. [...] "They won't let me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> let out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I'd call the police. But it's no good. Nobody knows, nobody comes. They could keep me {{as long as}} they liked only--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{had nothing}} to do with wages; it was an accident. I {{examined}} into it myself; so did Grouse, so did Slimsey; I sent them about everywhere. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure the fire was purely accidental, and to go and see about it; and they came back and agreed that it was purely accidental." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{bound up}} {{my hand in}} my {{handkerchief}} by that time, and held it tight under my cloak. I went back by train unnoticed, and returned to my friends' house. I hadn't even <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to Woodbury at all. I pretended I'd been spending the day at Whittingham. Next morning, I {{read in the paper}} of your father's murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{her with}} me in London. I hadn't got the money to keep her on at Brighton, so I had to take her. I've got a room up Highbury way. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the stage. It's {{a long way to}} have to come down to the West End every day, but it's a rare job to find anyone who'll let to ladies at all." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Hooja {{had made it}} appear that I had {{intentionally}} left Dian behind, and that I did not purpose ever returning to Pellucidar. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of another world and that I had tired of this and of its inhabitants.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now there's {{another little}} scheme that worked so easy I {{had to quit}} it. You see that bottle of blue ink on the table? I tattooed an anchor {{on the back of}} my hand and went to a bank and <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Admiral Dewey's nephew. They offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand, but I didn't know my uncle's first name. It shows, though, what an easy town it is. As for burglars, they won't go in a house now unless there's a hot supper ready and a few college {{students}} to wait on 'em. They're slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and I guess, taking the town from end to end, it's a plain case of assault and Battery." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another gay man {{interviewed by}} the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission {{reported}} that “My brother and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> having an argument. I {{went to the police}} looking for help. When my brother <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> masisi (gay), they slapped me and laughed. They beat me even worse than he did.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One day my balloon {{ran away}} {{with me and}} brought me across the deserts to this {{beautiful}} country. When the people saw me come from the sky they naturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazed them; and {{when they saw the}} initials painted on the balloon they called me Oz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the curtain}} {{fell on the}} first act, there was a {{tiresome}} ballet to be performed (according to the absurd Italian custom), before the opera went on. Though I had got over my first fright, I had been far too seriously startled to feel comfortable in the theater. I dreaded all sorts of impossible accidents; and when Midwinter and Armadale {{put the question to}} me, I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not well enough to stay {{through the rest of the}} performance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{bound to}} come in," [...] he said, {{without looking at}} Breeze, [...] "and say 'Howdy!' to the man that's bin a pal to my women folks and the kids--and acted white all through! I said to Mame, 'I reckon HE knows who I am, and that I kin be high-toned to them that's high-toned; kin return shake for shake and shot for shot!' Aye! that's me! So I was bound to come in like a gen'leman, sir, and here I am!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Tom," [...] he said, [...] "I shall {{give one}} of these outfits to the chief and you give the other to Hunting Dog; he has been your special chum since we started, and the {{presents}} will come better from you than from me. <b>I</b> expect <b>them</b> here in half an hour; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> busy all the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, then? I hoped {{you could have}} <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{something}} consoling. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{a minute}} or two I thought hard. There was no way up, and I hadn't nerve enough to lower myself over the ledge by one arm. When I moved the other {{cautiously}} it hurt worse than at first. I called to the others and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fixed, but got a shock when the guide looked up.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was asked}} my opinion, which I would have declined, being in no commission; but they pressed me to speak. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> for staying at least till the Rhinegrave came up, who, at least, might, if expresses {{were sent to}} hasten him, be up with us in twenty-four hours. But Offkirk could not hold his passion, and had not he been {{overruled}} he would have almost quarrelled with Marshal Horn. Upon which the old general, not to foment him, {{with a great deal}} of mildness stood up, and spoke thus-- ...|$|E
60|$|I now <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{willing to}} submit to the proposal, merely {{requesting}} a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.|$|E
60|$|When I showed {{myself to}} the two hostages, {{it was with the}} captain, who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the person the {{governor}} had ordered to look after them: and that it was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any where but by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me as a governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.|$|E
5000|$|According to Mohamed, when {{questioned}} by the school principal {{as to whether he}} had tried to make a bomb, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> no, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to make a clock." [...] He also questioned the fairness of the situation [...] "because I brought something to school that wasn't a threat to anyone. I didn't do anything wrong. I just showed my teachers something and I end up being arrested later that day." ...|$|R
60|$|They did {{not attack}} us, {{owing to the}} peace which exists between the Mahars and the Mezops, but I could see that they looked upon me with {{considerable}} suspicion. My friends <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a stranger from a remote country, and as we had previously planned against such a contingency I pretended ignorance of the language which the human beings of Pellucidar employ in conversing with the gorilla-like soldiery of the Mahars.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a sort}} {{of curiosity}} in his eye that I did not like. I don't know whether the steward had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> [...] "queer" [...] only, or downright drunk, but I know the man meant to have a good look at me. I watched him coming with a smile which, as he got into point-blank range, took effect and froze his very whiskers. I did not give him time to open his lips.|$|R
