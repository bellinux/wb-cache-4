40|$|In this study, {{countries}} were analyzed between 1990 and 2011 {{in order to}} determine whether a causal relationship exists among current account deficit, GDP, foreign direct investment, and <b>total</b> <b>credits</b> of G 7. Analysis took into account the cross-sectional dependence and was applied to test the causality among the variables form the panel. Firstly, panel unit root tests were used for determining stationary of variables. As a result of the panel unit root tests, it was found that GDP and foreign direct investment have a stationary structure and that <b>total</b> <b>credits</b> and current account deficit contain unit root. In order to see whether there is a long-term relationship among the variables or not, the panel co-integration test was used. As a result of the test, it was concluded that there is a co-integration relationship among the series. The possibility of a causal relationship was analyzed among the variables using the causality test developed by Elena Ivona Dumitrescu and Christophe Hurlin (2012). Results of the analysis showed a unidirectional causal relationship from current account deficit and foreign direct investment to GDP. Bidirectional causality was found between current account deficit and <b>total</b> <b>credits.</b> Finally, a unidirectional relationship was found from foreign direct investment to current account deficit and <b>total</b> <b>credits...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The aim {{of forming}} a CARICOM {{monetary}} union is not new. As {{a precursor to}} this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour {{the use of the}} member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the <b>total</b> <b>credit</b> line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|E
