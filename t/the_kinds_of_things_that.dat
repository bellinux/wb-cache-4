(But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. <b>The</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs are <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from." ...|$|E

6000|$|On careful examination, it {{is found}} that the {{materials}} of which each of these layers of more or less hard rock are composed are, for the most part, of the same nature as those which are at present being formed under known conditions {{on the surface of the}} earth. For example, the chalk, which constitutes a great part of the Cretaceous formation in some parts of the world, is practically identical in its physical and chemical characters with a substance which is now being formed at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and covers an enormous area; other beds of rock are comparable with the sands which are being formed upon sea-shores, packed together, and so on. Thus, omitting rocks of igneous origin, it is demonstrable that all these beds of stone, of which a total of not less than seventy thousand feet is known, have been formed by natural agencies, either out of the waste and washing of the dry land, or else by the accumulation of the exuviæ of plants and animals. Many of these strata are full of such exuviæ--the so-called [...] "fossils." [...] Remains of thousands of species of animals and plants, as perfectly recognisable as those of existing forms of life which you meet with in museums, or as the shells which you pick up upon the sea-beach, have been imbedded in the ancient sands, or muds, or limestones, just as they are being imbedded now, in sandy, or clayey, or calcareous subaqueous deposits. They furnish us with a record, the general nature of which cannot be misinterpreted, of <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have lived upon the surface of the earth during the time that is registered by this great thickness of stratified rocks. But even a superficial study of these fossils shows us that the animals and plants which live at the present time have had only a temporary duration; for the remains of such modern forms of life are met with, for the most part, only in the uppermost or latest tertiaries, and their number rapidly diminishes in the lower deposits of that epoch. In the older tertiaries, the places of existing animals and plants are taken by other forms, as numerous and diversified as those which live now in the same localities, but more or less different from them; in the mesozoic rocks, these are replaced by others yet more divergent from modern types; and, in the palæozoic formations the contrast is still more marked. Thus the circumstantial evidence absolutely negatives the conception of the eternity of the present condition of things. We can say, with certainty, that the present condition of things has existed for a comparatively short period; and that, so far as animal and vegetable nature are concerned, it has been preceded by a different condition. We can pursue this evidence until we reach the lowest of the stratified rocks, in which we lose the indications of life altogether. The hypothesis of the eternity of the present state of nature may therefore be put out of court.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{philosophical}} {{variants of}} nominalism propose that species are just names {{that people have}} assigned to groups of creatures but where the lines between species get drawn does not reflect any fundamental underlying biological cut-off point.

50|$|Generic {{data models}} are generalizations of {{conventional}} data models. They define standardised general relation types, together with <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{may be related}} by such a relation type. Generic data models are developed as an approach to solve some shortcomings of conventional data models. For example, different modelers usually produce different conventional data models of the same domain. This can lead to difficulty in bringing the models of different people together and is an obstacle for data exchange and data integration. Invariably, however, this difference is attributable to different levels of abstraction in the models and differences {{in the kinds of}} facts that can be instantiated (the semantic expression capabilities of the models). The modelers need to communicate and agree on certain elements which are to be rendered more concretely, {{in order to make the}} differences less significant.|$|E
