5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. <b>The</b> <b>cushion</b> itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E

Between 30 and 60 species are classified in this section, depending on the authority. Compared with other irises <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> varieties are scantily furnished with narrow sickle-shaped leaves and the flowers are usually borne singly on the stalks; they are often very dark and in some almost blackish. <b>The</b> <b>cushion</b> irises are somewhat fastidious growers, and to be successful with them they must be planted rather shallow in very gritty well-drained soil. They should not be disturbed in the autumn, and after the leaves have withered the roots should be protected from heavy rains until growth starts again naturally.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} seated buttock {{pressure}} distribution in six paraplegic patients {{by means of}} computerized pressure mapping. They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair cushions were studied: an air cushion, a contour cushion, a polyurethane foam cushion, a Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and a silicone gel cushion. A tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer. Peak pressures measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the Cubicushion, <b>the</b> polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> contour <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> and <b>the</b> air <b>cushion.</b> <b>The</b> areas of total contact measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : <b>the</b> air <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> contour <b>cushion</b> and <b>the</b> Cubicushion. Based on these findings, we conclude that <b>the</b> most advantageous <b>cushion</b> is <b>the</b> air <b>cushion</b> or <b>the</b> silicone gel <b>cushion.</b> Likewise, we conclude that the Cubicushion is not practical for pressure sore prevention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cushioning {{optimization}}. Abstract. To realize <b>the</b> <b>cushioning</b> optimization of multilayer regularly-arranged circular honeycombs under in-plane crushing loadings {{with high}} impact velocities, a {{finite element model}} is introduced to obtain <b>the</b> <b>cushioning</b> mechanical parameters. A simplified energy absorption model is used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>cushioning</b> performance, which shows that <b>the</b> <b>cushioning</b> performance is related to dynamic plateau stress and dynamic densification strain. The impact velocity, deformation mode and configuration parameters determine them. Empirical formulas of critical velocity of deformation mode transition, dynamic densification strain and dynamic plateau stress are given from the discussion of numerical results.

25|$|Speed {{cushions}} {{have several}} distinct advantages over similar traffic calming devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles.

This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.|$|E
25|$|The Hoover Constellation was a spherical canister-type {{vacuum cleaner}} notable for {{its lack of}} wheels. Floating on a cushion of air, it was a {{domestic}} hovercraft.

25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E

25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E
25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along the floor. On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E
