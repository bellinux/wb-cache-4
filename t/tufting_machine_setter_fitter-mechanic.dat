50|$|Thirty {{percent of}} bladder tumors {{probably}} result from occupational exposure {{in the workplace}} to carcinogens such as benzidine. 2-Naphthylamine, which is found in cigarette smoke, {{has also been shown}} to increase bladder cancer risk. Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, <b>machine</b> <b>setters,</b> and mechanics. Hairdressers are thought to be at risk as well because of their frequent exposure to permanent hair dyes.|$|R
50|$|A first {{generation}} of hybrid grass appeared in the 1990s. Grass roots were allowed to intertwine {{with a mix of}} sand and synthetic fibres as they grew. Three main methods exist to insert synthetic fibres in the root zone. The first is to inject fibres in the sand with a <b>tufting</b> <b>machine.</b> This is the method used to create Desso GrassMaster. The industry-leading hybrid grass system has been rebranded as GrassMaster by Tarkett Sports.|$|R

The presented work represents {{a continuation of the}} investigations into the possible application of miniature hydraulic actuation and control techniques to high speed reciprocating mechanisms in manipulative machinery. Earlier research in this area led to the design of knitting, sewing and <b>tufting</b> <b>machines</b> which employed actuators and rotary valves developed with the aim of exploiting some of the advantages that hydraulic mechanisms have over their mechanical equivalents.

50|$|Since the 18th century, {{the people}} from Genemuiden have been {{producing}} floor mats made of the bulrush that grows {{on the shores of}} the Zuiderzee. When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century, due to the change from salt water to fresh water (see Zuiderzee), the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets. In the sixties the first <b>tufting</b> <b>machines</b> were imported and currently Genemuiden is one of Europe's main production centres of tufted carpet and artificial grass.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{weighted}} inertial piloting {{of processes}} {{presented in this}} paper is a break-away in terms of the quality of machined mechanical workpieces compared to the traditional piloting carried out by <b>machine</b> <b>setters.</b> However, sometimes one has a stability problem during the piloting phase due to over adjustment. We propose to study the causes of this instability and to develop an approach in order to correct the problems. Once we have reminded ourselves of the basics of weighted inertial tolerancing, we will propose an approach to identify the most probable decentring. The applications of the concepts discussed in this article were tested over a period of two months. The results are very convincing, especially with the elimination of the phenomenon previously observed in identical conditions...|$|R
30|$|Weaving and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{knitting}} processes, produce waste that cannot easily be recycled. A common type of waste is selvedge, which is the semi-finished edge that is produced to stop the fabric from unravelling or fraying. The production of scarves produces long lengths of this material. Following a chance meeting, Johnsons of Elgin supplied samples of its scarf selvage to Turnberry Rug Works which, after some development work on the <b>tufting</b> <b>machines,</b> found {{it was able to}} use the selvage to manufacture rugs. Producing a rug using virgin cashmere would be a very expensive proposition; however, by using selvage, a luxurious product can be produced using material that would otherwise have been sold as waste. The rugs are currently in production and sold under the Ecochic brand.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of the workshops trade has {{been the result of}} the amalgamation of more specialist trades such as blacksmith and welder, coppersmith and metal worker, metal worker, and <b>machine</b> tool <b>setter</b> and operator. Each amalgamation occurred when the demand for a particular type of work diminished sufficiently to justify joining similar trades. One such absorption occurred in 1935, when the trades blacksmith and welder, and coppersmith and metalworker were abolished and replaced by the trade of metal worker.|$|R
50|$|In {{both cases}} the saddle rotated 360° on the {{carriage}} or pedestal and provided elevation up to 80°. An AEC Matador was the normal gun tractor. There were six marks of ordnance (the barrel and breech assembly) and a few marks of carriage of both versions, some using letter suffixes. The carriage included the recoil system, laying arrangements, fuse setting and loading machinery. The Mk IIC mounting enabled fully automatic engagements, apart from putting shells into the feed to the <b>machine</b> fuze <b>setter.</b>|$|R

40|$|To date, many {{epidemiological}} {{studies have been}} conducted to examine the association between occupation and bladder cancer incidence. However, results from these studies often have been inconsistent, and significant associations have rarely been found, possibly owing to the lack of adequate statistical power in these studies. This meta-analysis summarizes the relevant literature regarding occupation and bladder cancer incidence to increase the statistical power to detect associations. The Medline and Embase databases were searched to retrieve {{epidemiological studies}} published up until May 2008. Individual risk estimates for subjects with an employment history in the occupation of interest were extracted from each included publication. For each occupation, a summary relative risk (SRR) was calculated by means of a random effects model. Significantly increased risks with an SRR greater than 1. 20 were identified for miners [SRR= 1. 31, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 - 1. 57], bus drivers (SRR= 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 53), rubber workers (SRR= 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 58), motor mechanics (SRR= 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 46), leather workers (SRR= 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 49), blacksmiths (SRR= 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 58), <b>machine</b> <b>setters</b> (SRR= 1. 24, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 42), hairdressers (SRR= 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 1. 37) and mechanics (SRR= 1. 21, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 31). In conclusion, the studies reviewed provide consistent support for a small but significant increased risk of bladder cancer among workers in these nine occupations. Although the relative risk of bladder cancer associated with these occupations is small, the public health impact may be significant, considering the substantial number of people who were and are employed in these occupations. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Britain had {{successfully}} tested a new HAA gun, 3.6-inch, in 1918. In 1928 3.7-inch became the preferred solution, {{but it took}} 6 years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) began in 1937; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At {{the same time the}} Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness. In 1939 a <b>Machine</b> Fuse <b>Setter</b> was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting.|$|R
50|$|In early 1942 the Governor of Gibraltar sought 5.25-in {{guns for}} dual anti-aircraft/coast defence role. None was forthcoming. However, {{later that year}} Anti-Aircraft Command in UK {{acquired}} three twin-gun turrets from the Admiralty, which were installed around London in permanent positions. Trials and use led the army to design a single gun mounting in two marks, both with an underground engine room to provide electrical and hydraulic power for traverse, elevation, fuze setting, ramming and other tasks. Fitted with the standard army <b>Machine</b> Fuze <b>Setter</b> No 10 these guns had a rate of fire of 10 rds/min and a maximum height of 50,000 ft, with an effective height of 36,000 ft. Mark 1A was a mild steel turret for anti aircraft use only, Mk 1B was an armoured turret for anti aircraft and coast defence use. The gun was designated Mk 2.|$|R
40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from cutting oils {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of splash guards, provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and <b>machine</b> tool <b>setters</b> (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), centre lathe turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and machine tool operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with cutting oils before controls were introduced. These findings are reassuring, but continued monitoring of scrotal cancer incidence and mortality is required...|$|R
50|$|Incubation {{takes about}} 21 days, {{and is often}} a two-step process. Initial {{incubation}} is done in <b>machines</b> known as <b>setters.</b> A modern setter {{is the size of}} a large room, with a central corridor and racks on either side. Eggs are held relatively tightly (large end up) in trays, which are stored in the racks. Inside the setter, temperature and humidity are closely maintained. Blowers or fans circulate air to ensure uniform temperature, and heating or cooling is applied as needed by automated controls. The racks pivot or tilt from side to side, usually on an hourly basis. As an example, one commercial machine can hold up to 124,416 eggs and measures about 4.7 metres wide by 7.2 metres deep. Setters often hold more than one hatch, on a staggered hatch-day basis, and operate continuously. The setter phase lasts about 18 days.|$|R
