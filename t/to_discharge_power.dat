50|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles {{have the potential}} to be utilized to provide ancillary services to the grid, specifically load regulation and spinning reserves. Plug-in {{electric vehicles}} can behave like distributed energy storage and have the potential <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> back to the grid through bidirectional flow. Plug-in electric vehicles have the ability to supply power at a fast rate which enables them to be used like spinning reserves and provide grid stability with the increased use of intermittent generation such as wind and solar. The technologies to utilize electric vehicles to provide ancillary services are not yet widely implemented, but there is much anticipation of their potential.|$|E

They begin their day at a full charge at the maximum battery capacity of 10 kWhr.

The online electric vehicles charge only while driving over electrified road segments. The plugin electric vehicles charge immediately upon arrival to work and upon return to home for a duration sufficient to return to full charge.|$|E
40|$|A battery {{energy storage}} scheme to enable {{short-term}} dispatch commitment from a grid-connected wind-turbine generating power station is considered. Among {{the various types}} of energy storage medium, technical factors leading to the selection of battery are explained. The scheme utilizes two battery energy storage systems (BESS) in which the generated wind power charges one BESS while concurrently, the second BESS is <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> into the grid. The role of the two BESS interchanges when the BESS reaches specified state of charge/discharge. Furthermore, based on forecasted charging wind power and the monitored states of charge of the two BESS, the discharge power level from the generating station is determined and scheduled a few hours ahead. The dispatch scheme maximizes wind energy harnessed, achieved with the minimum number of the BESS switch-overs. The design thus prolongs the service life of the BESS. Numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the scheme are also included...|$|E

5000|$|Section 3 of the {{amendment}} set forth a procedure whereby a President who believes he will be temporarily unable {{to perform the duties}} of his office may declare himself [...] "unable <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> the <b>powers</b> and duties of his office."

The Vice President continues to act as President until the President declares, by another letter to the leaders of each house of Congress, that he is once again able <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> the <b>powers</b> and duties of the presidency.|$|R
3000|$|In this paper, it {{is assumed}} that the {{connecting}} states of the EVs include the charging state ([...] P_j,t^V = - P_j,t^Vc), the idle state ([...] P_j,t^V = 0 [...]) and the discharging state ([...] P_j,t^V = P_j,t^Vd). It is also assumed that the connecting states of the TCLs include the “ON” state ([...] P_j,t^L = - [...] P_j,t^Lc) and the “OFF” state ([...] P_j,t^L = 0 [...]). To respond to the power demand, the controllable EV can change its connecting state between charging state and idle state (“charging ↔ idle”) and between idle state and discharging state (“idle ↔ discharging”), and the controllable TCL can change its connecting state between “ON” state and “OFF” state (“ON ↔ OFF”). The response modes of “charging ↔ idle” and “ON ↔ OFF” are just to change the time period for power consumption, and the cost of the EV’s “charging ↔ idle” mode is verified to be lower than the cost of TCL’s “ON ↔ OFF” mode [25]. However, the EV battery has <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> to the power grid in the response mode of “idle ↔ discharging”, which requires more cost compensation than other response modes [26].|$|E
40|$|Titanium dioxide (Ti 02) f;im {{is one of}} the {{promising}} candidate materials that often used in various applications such as photo - sensor, ultra - violet (UV) protection and solar cell applications. In this study, Ti 02 thin film was prepared by a RF reactive magnetron sputtering system using Titanium (Ti) target as the starting material. Results using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) and Langmuir Probe equipment show that density plasma distribution of Ti, Ar, ~ ran+d 0 atom changes with respect <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>power,</b> working pressure (WP) and environment gas ratio. Observation on the atomic lines of Ti I and Ar I in pure Argon environment was found increased as the discharge power and working pressure increased. Emission line intensity of Arf ions with wavelength of 443. 02 nm shows significant increase as the discharge power increases. Increase in ~ rio+n population has contributed in increase of atomic Ti released inside the system. Influence of 0 2 gas flow in reactive magnetron sputtering is very critical during the formation of Ti 02. Significant change in emission response of Ti and 0 lines suggests Ti 02 film starts to form over critical ratio of 7 % ratio of 021 (Ar + 02). Further investigation using X - ray diffraction (XRD) shows that TiOz film has been formed with anatase crystallite behavior. In addition, Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) result shows that the Ti 02 particles size increases as the working pressure increase inside the deposition chamber. Smooth film with roughness less than 1. 6 nm was also observed. High transmittance (> 70 %) in the visible region can be generally observed using Ultraviolet - Visible spectroscopy (UV -Vis). Direct optical band gap for Ti 02 thin deposited at working pressure of 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m and 40 mTorr was found 3. 99, 3. 38, 3. 39, 3. 43, 3. 24 and 2. 96 eV respectively. Therefore, by controlling those plasma properties in magnetron sputtering system, a good high quality Ti 02 film layer can be formed. This is important in order to optimize Ti 02 thin film for solar cell application...|$|E

Thus, unlike the procedure under Section 3 of the amendment, a declaration by the incapacitated President to the effect that he is able to resume the powers and duties of his office does not have immediate effect if the incapacity was declared under section 4 of the amendment. The President only resumes his powers and duties if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet do not recertify the President's incapacity within the constitutionally prescribed four-day period. If the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet recertify that declaration to the leaders of Congress, the Vice President remains in his role as Acting President and Congress is constitutionally obligated to consider (or to assemble within 48 hours and consider, if not already in session) the issue.
