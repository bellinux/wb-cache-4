He was consultant to the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow; Disney Studios' contribution was America the Beautiful, a 19-minute film in the 360-degree Circarama theater <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the most popular}} attractions. The following year he acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California, where he designed the opening, closing and medal ceremonies.|$|E

Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Latos started 2011 on the {{disabled}} list due to a spring training shoulder injury. He lost his first four starts of the season, extending his losing streak to nine consecutive starts dating back to 2010. The streak tied the longest streak in Padres history, held by Andy Benes and Dennis Rasmussen. Latos had a no-decision in his next start after the bullpen blew a save opportunity, preventing him from earning a win. He lost another decision for a 10-game losing streak <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> less than the club record held by Gary Ross. Latos won on May 15 against the Colorado Rockies to end his losing streak. He ended the 2011 season with a 9–14 record and a 3.47 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{final cost}} of Apollo was {{reported}} to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973, It took {{up the majority of}} NASA's budget while it was being developed. For example, in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of NASA's total $5.2 billion budget. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the biggest investment of the US in science, research and development, and employed thousands of American scientists. A single Saturn V launch in 1969 cost up to $375 million, compared to the National Science Foundation's fiscal year 1970 budget of $440 million.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for {{the amount of time that}} it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
