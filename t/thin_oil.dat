50|$|Most modern {{finishing}} oils use a {{blend of}} <b>oil</b> and a <b>thinning</b> agent such as white spirit. Raw oils tend to be applied too thickly, leading to a thick layer that cannot cure effectively and so remains sticky. A <b>thinned</b> <b>oil</b> is easier and more reliable to apply. Such commercial mixtures also contain metallic driers to improve their performance.|$|R
5000|$|... 1880-1920 — The [...] "Oil and Whiting" [...] {{method of}} crack {{detection}} {{is used in}} the railroad industry to find cracks in heavy steel parts. (A part is soaked in <b>thinned</b> <b>oil,</b> then painted with a white coating that dries to a powder. Oil seeping out from cracks turns the white powder brown, allowing the cracks to be detected.) This was the precursor to modern liquid penetrant tests.|$|R
25|$|Oil spills at sea are {{generally}} much more damaging {{than those on}} land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.|$|E

Unable to get the blaze under control in bad weather the salvage vessels asked for help from an Indian Coast Guard patrol boat with external fire fighting equipment. By 10 July most of the 2,400 containers on board had been destroyed by fire. The damaged bow section sank the next night at [...] to a depth of [...] with what remained of the cargo and 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in the tanks.

50|$|The 'fad' {{is often}} {{lubricated}} with an oil that then becomes {{integrated into the}} overall finish. This helps to prevent the 'fad' from lifting previously applied layers of shellac. Typically, softer/ <b>thinner</b> <b>oils</b> such as mineral oil will produce a glossier though less durable finish whereas harder/ more viscous oils such as walnut oil and olive oil will produce a more durable finish. Although boiled linseed oil is commonly used as a wood treatment, it is too viscous to use for French polishing.|$|R
30|$|Thick-oil rim {{reservoirs}} {{are characterized}} by a thicker pay zone compared to water and gas cap zones, for {{the case of a}} three-phase reservoir. In this study, a thick-oil rim reservoir was modelled with WOC and GOC heights of 0.03  m and 0.37  m {{from the bottom of the}} reservoir, respectively. On the contrary, thin-oil rim reservoirs {{are characterized by}} a <b>thinner</b> <b>oil</b> zone compared to water and gas cap zones.

O'Neill remarks that [...] "Inspired, perhaps, by her day job of {{painting}} houses, Bowling turned to more industrial media: damp vinyl spackle, a building compound that {{is applied to}} wooden panels to create a matte, fresco-like surface. <b>Thinned</b> <b>oil</b> pigments are poured, allowed to dry, and then the Sisyphean task of sanding begins." [...] Initial layers generally correspond with {{the color of the}} light—varying from pinks, golds, blues, and oranges. Through this layering and sanding, she creates a luminous quality in her landscapes.|$|R

50|$|He worked almost {{exclusively}} on illustration board, drawing with charcoal.

50|$|The main {{purposes}} of the diluent are to dissolve the polymer and adjust the viscosity of the paint. It is volatile and does not {{become part of the}} paint film. It also controls flow and application properties, and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a <b>thinner</b> <b>oil</b> is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily—once the solvent has evaporated, the remaining paint is fixed to the surface.|$|R

He gathered rocks and driftwood, which he composed around his rustic home in various assemblages. He began painting large works on roofing paper purchased from a local lumber company. Working with large sheets of paper {{on the floor in the}} studio above his living room, Anderson used <b>thinned</b> <b>oil</b> paint and large brushes. The scale of the format enabled his brushstrokes to become expansive and expressive, while its texture gave unexpected complexities which he valued.|$|R

5000|$|Robert Chesebrough, a young chemist whose {{previous}} work of distilling fuel {{from the oil}} of sperm whales had been rendered obsolete by petroleum, went to Titusville to see what new materials had commercial potential.

50|$|One {{pound of}} {{marijuana}} yields from 1/5 to 1/10 of {{a pound of}} hash oil.

50|$|Rothko's {{method was}} {{to apply a}} thin layer of binder mixed with pigment {{directly}} onto uncoated and untreated canvas and to paint significantly <b>thinned</b> <b>oils</b> directly onto this layer, creating a dense mixture of overlapping colors and shapes. His brushstrokes were fast and light, a method he would continue to use until his death. His increasing adeptness at this method is apparent in the paintings completed for the Chapel. With an absence of figurative representation, what drama there {{is to be found in}} a late Rothko is in the contrast of colors, radiating against one another. His paintings can then be likened to a sort of fugue-like arrangement: each variation counterpoised against one another, yet all existing within one architectonic structure.|$|R
5000|$|Some (Wifredo Ricart, Alfa-Romeo) {{feared the}} {{build-up}} of heat inside the cylinder, however Ricardo proved that {{if only a}} <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> film is retained and working clearance between the sleeve and the cylinder barrel was kept small, moving sleeves are almost transparent to heat, actually transporting heat from upper to lower parts of the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} native {{portrait}} painters of the British school were English painters Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds, who also specialized in clothing their subjects in an eye-catching manner. Gainsborough's Blue Boy {{is one of}} the most famous and recognized portraits of all time, painted with very long brushes and <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> color to achieve the shimmering effect of the blue costume. Gainsborough was also noted for his elaborate background settings for his subjects.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} variators, but {{in common with}} the Hele-Shaw clutch, the Beier gear does not rely on {{friction}} between the disks, but rather on viscous drag through a <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> film between them. This has little slip, less than 1%, and the lack of friction reduces the losses through heat and thus permits a small compact mechanism to still handle a high power. Oil is often pumped through the drive, also having a cooling effect.|$|E
5000|$|In her Swan Pond (2002), {{the amount}} of <b>thinner,</b> <b>oil,</b> and so forth added to the paint has a {{profound}} effect {{on the quality of the}} brush calligraphy and the details in a painting. Broad, scumbled masses provide the setting for paint that has varying degrees of oil added to it. The gazebo, water reflection, and swans achieve their clarity because they are rendered with brushstrokes that are more thickly loaded with paint and also because that paint has a small amount of oil added. This follows the [...] "lean to fat" [...] concept of layering. The [...] "fatter" [...] final, detail touches sit on top with clarity due to the added oil, which created a sharper edge over the less oily paint beneath.|$|R
2500|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} artists of the 20th century. Miró pioneered the technique of staining; creating blurry, multi-colored cloudy backgrounds in <b>thinned</b> <b>oil</b> paint throughout the 1920s and 1930s; on top of which he added his calligraphy, characters and abundant lexicon of words, and imagery. Arshile Gorky openly admired Miró's work and painted Miró-like Gorky paintings, before finally discovering his own originality in the early 1940s. During the 1960s Miró painted large (abstract expressionist scale) radiant fields of vigorously brushed paint in blue, in white, and other monochromatic fields of colors; with blurry black orbs and calligraphic stone-like shapes, floating at random. These works resembled the Color Field paintings of the younger generation. Biographer Jacques Dupin said this about Miró's work of the early 1960s: ...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{using an}} outside setting, {{it is not}} a {{conversation}} piece; it has a certain psychological depth brought about with the attention given to the details of dress and texture as testaments to worldly elegance and wealth. The model's hair is treated {{in the same manner as}} the leaves and branches of the trees in the background and some of the sunset's pink glaze is reflected in the colour of her gown. The lonely tree behind her matches her isolated figure and adds to the impression of the remoteness of the abandoned feminine figure in the deserted landscape; possibly longing for something she cannot achieve in her life. A shimmering transparent effect is given to the hand-held scarf by the use of long brush strokes and <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> colour. The portrait captures the model's charming personality and fresh beauty; her face is the only part of the painting that is calm and solid. The paint is applied with soft and nervous, flying brush strokes. The artist is treating the surface of the woman's gown with long zigzagging brushes of <b>thin</b> <b>oil</b> paint all the way down to her feet, to achieve the vibrant effect, versus the calm of her face.|$|E
