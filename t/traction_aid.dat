40|$|The {{potential}} {{increase in}} timber yields achieved through the thinning {{process in the}} forest is often reduced by soil compaction caused by the machinery involved in the thinning. This is often compounded by use of unsuitable machinery on difficult sites that are poorly drained, or in waterlogged conditions during wet weather. The aims of this project were to measure the degree of soil compaction and to investigate the impacts {{of different types of}} machinery. The parameters used to measure the soil compaction caused were bulk density, soil shear strength, cone penetration resistance and water infiltration rates. Soil chemical analyses were performed to investigate the possible impact on potassium, phosphorus, nitrate, total nitrogen, pH, organic carbon and organic matter levels in the soil. The impact on some microbial populations was also examined. The harvester felling the timber during thinning was found to have little impact on soil compaction in comparison to the forwarders which all cause soil compaction to some extent during timber extraction. On mineral soils {{it was found that the}} forwarder with the bigger load capacity, requiring fewer loaded passes over the extraction rack caused less soil compaction and disturbance. On wet soils the use of traction aids such as band tracks appears to reduce the soil damage and improve machine mobility. However when used unnecessarily during dry conditions, the band tracks will themselves cause significant soil compaction. The use of brash mats on the extraction racks from felled tree branches are important to reduce soil compaction and ground disturbance. All the parameters measured indicate lower values for compaction on the extraction racks with brash mats. Brash protects the root mat layer from the direct compactive forces of the passing machineiy and thus reduces potential tree root damage. On wet and slippery soils, brash acts as a good <b>traction</b> <b>aid</b> for the machinery. Soil nutrients do not appear to be directly affected by increased soil compaction. Root damage, reduced water infiltration and soil rutting caused by machinery will affect the uptake of the nutrients by the growing trees...|$|E
50|$|In snowy conditions, {{transportation}} authorities {{may require}} that snow chains or other <b>traction</b> <b>aids</b> be installed on vehicles, {{or at least}} supplied for them. This can apply to all vehicles, or only those without other <b>traction</b> <b>aids,</b> such as four-wheel drive or special tires. Local requirements may be enforced at checkpoints or by other type of inspection. Snow chains should be installed on one or more drive axles of the vehicle, with requirements varying for dual-tire or multi-driven-axle vehicles that range from 'one pair of tires on a driven axle' to 'all tires on all driven axles', possibly also one or both steering (front) wheels, requiring snow chains whenever required by signage or conditions.|$|R

40|$|Background. Elastomeric {{chains and}} NiTi coil springs {{are two major}} <b>traction</b> <b>aids</b> in {{orthodontic}} tooth movements. Force degradation occurs over time in both groups, with higher percentages in elastic chains. The effects of environmental factors and some mouth rinses on this force decay have been previously studied. No study has been performed to evaluate the effect of current popular mouth rinses such as Orthokin, Sensikin and Persica on this force degradation. Methods. Forty pieces of elastic chains consisting of 5 loops (Ortho Technology, USA) and 40 NiTi closed coil springs (3 M Unitek, Germany) were divided into 4 groups: control (artificial saliva), Orthokin mouthwash, Sensikin mouthwash and Persica mouthwash. All the groups were kept in an incubator at 37 °C for 3 weeks. In the test groups, the samples were immersed in mouthwash twice a day. Force degradationwas measured at 5 time intervals: baseline, 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week and 3 weeks, using a digital force gauge. Repeated-measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Results. Force decay occurred over time in both elastic chain and coil spring groups. In elastic chain group, after 3 weeks, Orthokin mouth rinse had significantly lower force degradation compared to other groups (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Based {{the results of this}} study, these three mouthwashes did not increase the force degradation of orthodontic <b>traction</b> <b>aids</b> under study...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Preoperative {{skeletal}} <b>traction</b> as an <b>aid</b> in {{reduction of}} congenital hip dislocation {{in the older}} child {{has been associated with}} an unacceptably high in-cidence of avascular necrosis, redislocation, and poor results. In contrast, femoral shortening as an aid in re-duction has yielded a high rate of very satisfactory re-suits, and may be essential for obtaining a stable, physiological, non-compressive reduction. We have ana-lyzed the complications and the radiographic and func-tional outcomes of treatment in thirty-nine hips.

50|$|The Diablo VT was {{introduced}} in 1993. Although the VT differed from the standard Diablo {{in a number of}} ways, by far the most notable change was the addition of all wheel drive, which made use of a viscous center differential (a modified version of LM002's 4WD system). This provided the new nomenclature for the car (VT stands for viscous traction). The new drivetrain could direct up to 25% of the torque to the front wheels to <b>aid</b> <b>traction</b> during rear wheel slip, thus significantly improving the handling characteristics of the car.|$|R
50|$|By {{depressing}} {{the freezing}} point of water, calcium chloride {{is used to}} prevent ice formation and is used to de-ice. This application consumes {{the greatest amount of}} calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil. As a de-icing agent, it is more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride. When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small, white spheres a few millimeters in diameter, called prills. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as −52 °C (−62 °F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a liquid ballast, <b>aiding</b> <b>traction</b> in cold climates.|$|R
40|$|There is medical {{consensus}} {{on the need to}} remove the tick within 24 hours the mite parasites to the human host, to avoid possible complications. The preferred way is by gently <b>traction</b> the mite, <b>aided</b> by forceps without twisting or chokes with toxic agents, because of the possibility that the mite excretes bacteria mixed with substances. The average time of extraction is estimated between one or three minutes. In children parasitized by ticks this amount of time can be excessive when it’s necessary restraint without the consent of the minor. Using this technique we reduce the time to seconds and the damage caused to the skin is minimal...|$|R

50|$|A {{subsequent}} coronial inquiry, {{headed by}} NSW State Coroner Derrick Hand, found in December 1990 that the sand {{that had been}} applied to the track by 3801 to <b>aid</b> <b>traction</b> had insulated the train from the rails, meaning that the track circuits failed to detect {{the presence of the}} first train, allowing the following inter-urban train to be given a false green (clear) aspect (known as a wrong-side failure). Mr Hand also considered it likely that a passenger on 3801 had applied a handbrake on the third carriage, and that this, combined with the heavy load, the steep grade and the curvature of the line, had prevented the steam train from restarting. No fault was found with the signalling system, although the coroner recommended that it be upgraded as soon as possible.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a remotely controlled robotic solution {{for those who}} must sometimes enter agriculturally confined spaces in attempts to assist with grain bin cleanout, particularly by manipulating the sweep auger. In 2015 alone, {{there were at least}} 47 documented incidents that occurred in agriculturally confined spaces, of which more than half were fatal. While there have been several advancements in the quality and effectiveness of sweep augers, there have been very few that offer the safety and adaptability of the robotic solution proposed. This robotic solution is a four-wheeled, skid-steering style robot with camera and lighting attachments that allow the user to operate from outside of a grain bin. The intended use of this robot is to manipulate the sweep auger by providing forward advancement assistance via an interfacing front-end attachment.

50|$|Vibratory feeders, {{commonly}} known as a bowl feeder, are self-contained devices, consisting of a specially shaped bowl designed to orient the parts to a specific orientation. A vibrating drive unit, upon which the bowl is mounted and a variable-amplitude control box controls the bowl feeder. Usually included is an out feed accumulation track (linear or gravity) to convey parts along and discharge into the assembly machine comes in many shapes and sizes. The drive unit, available in both electromagnetic and pneumatic drives, vibrates the bowl, forcing the parts to move up a circular, inclined track. The tooling (hand made) is designed to sort and orient the parts in to a consistent, repeatable position. The track length, width, and depth are carefully chosen to suit each application, component shape and size. Special bowl and track coatings are applied according to shape size and material of the component which <b>aids</b> <b>traction,</b> damage to the product and lower acoustic levels. A variable speed control box is used for controlling the vibration speed of the bowl feeder, and can control the flow of parts to the out feed track via sensors.|$|R
