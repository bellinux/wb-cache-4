40|$|We {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness and budget {{impact of a}} <b>suicide</b> <b>helpline</b> in Belgium, consisting of a telephone-and a chat service. An age-and gender-dependent Markov model with a ten-year time horizon and a one-year cycle length was developed, assuming a societal perspective, to predict cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the helpline users. The model included six transition states: the initial state (at risk), first attempt, re-attempt, follow-up, suicide and death from other causes. Data {{on the effect of}} the helpline and costs associated with model states were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to capture uncertainty. In addition, the budget impact of the helpline was analysed. Over ten years, the telephone-as well as the chat service could avoid about 36 % of suicides and attempts in this high-risk population. In males, 0. 063 QALYs (95 % confidence interval, CI 0. 030 - 0. 097) and 0. 035 QALYs (95 % CI - 0. 026 - 0. 096) were gained by users of the telephone-and chat service respectively. The corresponding values for females were 0. 019 QALYs (95 % CI - 0. 015 - 0. 052) and a QALY-neutral result of - 0. 005 (95 % CI - 0. 071 - 0. 062).

50|$|The first Nightline {{was set up}} in 1970 at Essex University by {{a former}} {{director}} of the local Samaritans branch and the university chaplain to try to reduce the rate of student <b>suicide.</b> The <b>helpline</b> was founded on the understanding that some students would be reluctant to approach outsiders for help and would find it easier to speak to another student. The idea caught on and spread first to Imperial College in London in 1971, and then to many other universities around the United Kingdom.During the early 1980s, individual Nightlines started to work together to share skills and ideas, such as publicity, recruitment and training concepts. The umbrella organization National Nightline was founded in 1991 as a formal structure for this work, and represents all affiliated organizations, but has no authority over them. It became a registered charity in early 2006. It subsequently adopted the operating name of Nightline Association, and in 2012 changed the name at Companies House to formally become the Nightline Association.|$|R

40|$|Background: Helplines are a {{significant}} phenomenon in the mixed economy of health and social care. Given the often anon- ymous and fleeting nature of caller contact, {{it is difficult to}} obtain data about their impact and how users perceive their value. This paper reports findings from an online survey of callers contacting Samaritans emotional support services. Aims: To explore the (self-reported) characteristics of callers using a national <b>suicide</b> prevention <b>helpline</b> and their reasons given for contacting the service, and to present the users’ evaluations of the service they received. Methods: Online survey of a self-selected sample of callers. Results: 1, 309 responses were received between May 2008 and May 2009. There were high incidences of expressed suicidality and mental health issues. Regular and ongoing use of the service was common. Respondents used the service for complex and varied reasons and often as part of a network of support. Conclusions: Respondents reported high levels of satisfaction with the service and perceived contact to be helpful. Although Samaritans aims to provide a crisis service, many callers do not access this in isolation or as a last resort, instead contacting the organi- zation selectively and often in tandem with other types of support...|$|R

5000|$|Gay {{and lesbian}} youth bear an {{increased}} risk of suicide, substance abuse, school problems, and isolation because of a [...] "hostile and condemning environment, verbal and physical abuse, rejection and isolation from family and peers". Further, LGB youths are more likely to report psychological and physical abuse by parents or caretakers, and more sexual abuse. Suggested reasons for this disparity are that (1) LGBT youths may be specifically targeted {{on the basis of their}} perceived sexual orientation or gender non-conforming appearance, and (2) [...] "risk factors associated with sexual minority status, including discrimination, invisibility, and rejection by family members...may lead to an increase in behaviors that are associated with risk for victimization, such as substance abuse, sex with multiple partners, or running away from home as a teenager." [...] A 2008 study showed a correlation between the degree of rejecting behavior by parents of LGB adolescents and negative health problems in the teenagers studied. Crisis centers in larger cities and information sites on the Internet have arisen to help youth and adults. The Trevor <b>Helpline,</b> a <b>suicide</b> prevention <b>helpline</b> for LGBT youth, was established by the filmmakers following the 1998 airing on HBO of the Academy Award winning short film Trevor; Daniel Radcliffe donated a large sum to the group and has appeared in service ads for them condemning homophobia.|$|R
5000|$|Attempted suicide {{rates for}} lesbian, gay, bisexual, {{transgender}} and questioning (LGBTQ) youth and {{adults in the}} U.S. are three times higher than national averages.

40|$|Media {{campaigns have}} {{received}} increased attention as an intervention for combating suicide. Suicide prevention campaigns involving {{public service announcements}} (PSAs) have not been well described and {{have been subject to}} minimal evaluation. This study aimed to identify suicide prevention PSAs from around the world and analyze and describe their content. We searched the Internet for short, English-language PSAs that had been screened as part of suicide prevention campaigns and identified 35. Most commonly, these PSAs focused on the general population and/or people who might be at risk of suicide, and had a particular emphasis on young people. Almost 60 % promoted open discussion about suicide, around 50 % indicated that the life of a suicidal person was important, about 40 % acknowledged the suffering associated with suicidal thoughts and feelings, about 25 % stressed that suicide is preventable, and about 20 % focused on the devastating impact of suicide for those left behind. Most PSAs promoted some sort of support for people at risk of <b>suicide,</b> usually a <b>helpline</b> or website. Although these messages appeared appropriate and practical {{there is a lack of}} research on the impact that they may have on people with varying degrees of suicide risk. Further work is needed to ensure that they are consistent with theories of behavior change, and that they are having their desired impacts. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor’s thesis “Coverage of suicides in Estonian media” was {{to analyze}} the {{coverage}} of suicides in Estonian media through three different suicide cases and evaluate, to which extent is the coverage of suicides in Estonian media coherent with the suggestions made by the World Health Organization (WHO). Three largest daily newspapers, two local papers and one weekly were used as the source for analysis. Three different suicide cases were selected for analysis: a politician’s wife, a businessman and a schoolboy. 29 articles were analyzed, using a combined method of critical discourse analysis and content analysis. Since studies have proved that media has {{an important role in}} preventing suicides, the research questions were posed based on the suggestions for media organizations by WHO, which should be used for covering suicides. The results of this research can be shortly summarized as following: - Suicide method was mentioned in 18 articles out of 29, method has been described in detail in 12 articles - Almost all the articles presented suicide as a result of one certain reason - The grief of relatives was shown in only one article - Experts were interviewed in three articles - None of the articles presented information about the warning signs of <b>suicide</b> or <b>helplines</b> - <b>Suicide</b> statistics was used in two cases, generally in correct form - Suicide victims were not depicted in a heroic way - Physical harm and evaluations to the suicide method were presented in case of covering an unusual method (self-ignition - Five suicide articles were published as a top news story, one article was published on the front page - Photos of the suicide victims were used in five articles, three of them in an incorrect manner The posed research question: To which extent is the coverage of suicides in Estonian media coherent with the suggestions made by the World Health Organization? Proved the hypothesis: Estonian media does generally not cover suicides in coherence with the suggestions of World Health Organization.
