50|$|In 2003, GOES 9 was {{reactivated}} again, and leased to the Japan Meteorological Agency as {{a replacement}} for the GMS-5 satellite at 155° East, because its intended replacement, MTSAT-1, had failed to reach orbit. It remained in this position until MTSAT-1R became operational in November 2005, at which time GOES 9 was again deactivated and placed into storage. It was permanently retired from service and <b>raised</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> graveyard <b>orbit</b> on 14 June 2007.|$|R
50|$|By 8 October 1984, USA-5 {{had been}} <b>raised</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> with <b>a</b> perigee of 19961 km, an apogee of 20404 km, {{a period of}} 717.98 minutes, and 63.2 degrees of {{inclination}} to the equator. The satellite had a design life of 5 years and a mass of 758 kg. It broadcast the PRN 12 signal in the GPS demonstration constellation, and was retired from service on 26 March 1996. It was the last Block I satellite to be decommissioned.|$|R
50|$|After {{some initial}} {{problems}} deploying its solar array, INSAT-1B became operational in October 1983. It was located at 74° east {{for most of}} its operational life, before being moved to 93° east in 1992. In August 1993 it was decommissioned and <b>raised</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> graveyard <b>orbit</b> slightly above geosynchronous altitude. As of 14 November 2013, it is in <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> with <b>a</b> perigee of 35741 km, an apogee of 35846 km, inclination of 14.69 degrees and an orbital period of 23.93 hours.|$|R
40|$|The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and UNCOPUOS {{request that}} GEO {{spacecraft}} at their end-of-life are <b>raised</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> graveyard <b>orbit</b> with sufficient altitude clearance to operational satellites. Based on orbital data in ESA 2 ̆ 7 s DISCOS database the situation near the geostationary ring (GEO) is assessed for a reference epoch in December 2008. An {{analysis of the}} orbital evolution histories of 970 objects showed that 335 of the GEO objects were controlled inside their longitude slots, 476 were drifting above, below or through GEO, 154 were captured {{at one of the}} two stable libration points, and 5 objects had <b>an</b> ill-defined <b>orbit</b> status (e. g. due to insufficient orbit data). Furthermore, there were 46 controlled satellites and 170 uncontrolled objects with no TLE information at all. Thus, the total number of known objects in the geostationary region was 1186, out of which 381 were controlled, 800 were uncontrolled and 5 could not be classified. During the year 2008, 12 GEO spacecraft reached their end of life. Seven of them were re-orbited following the IADC guidelines, two were re-orbited with an insufficient GEO clearance and three spacecraft were abandoned without any re-orbiting manoeuvre. The re-orbiting statistics of the years from 1997 to 2008 show that the adherence to the IADC space debris mitigation guidelines is slowly improving over time. Also the re-orbiting practice of GPS satellites is analysed. For 22 of the 56 launched GPS satellites a disposal manoeuvre was identified from the DISCOS TLE data. Since the year 2000, the orbits of the GPS satellites are usually raised by about 1000 km at end-of-life. Finally the re-orbiting options of Galileo satellites are compared. An alternative to the currently proposed orbit raising after end-of-life is the re-orbiting into <b>a</b> lower <b>orbit</b> with the highest achievable eccentricity. It will take more than 100 years until a satellite will finally decay. But the average risk that the satellite will encounter a collision during its long journey towards its final decay is about 10 - 7 which can be considered low enough to make it an attractive re-orbiting alternative...|$|R

40|$|There was a {{principle}} adopted upon reforming banking and credit system in Poland, that a {{sine qua non}} condition to open a credit for the borrower is his capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit. Yet, legal acts introducing the economic reform failed to precise {{the contents of the}} notion "capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit". In fact, both in literaturę and in practice divergent opinions can be encountered upon discussing that issue. The tank of the present article is to explicate the essence of the notion on the grounds of valid credit laws in Poland. The author shares the opinion that a normative category of capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit has <b>to</b> be derived from banking law regulations. Provisions of that statute prove that the capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit is <b>to</b> be understood as a credited party's solvency in the respect of repayment of a drawn credit. Opposing the attempts of different concepts of capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit <b>to</b> extend the notion's range, the author indicates {{at the same time that}} the capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit as the solvency in the respect of a drawn credit is the basic but not the sole- as it is sometimes advocated- riterion of opening credits by banks. In the Polish economy the interest rates are not shaped along the suppily- -demand formula and do not express the generation of effectivness in economy. Maintaining limits to crediting action requires thus a peculiar banking control of credits. The very criterion of capacity <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> credit cannot be sufficient to select credit applicants. The additional criteria would be necessary.
