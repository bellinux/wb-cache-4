5000|$|Round {{parallel}} {{files are}} similar to round files, except {{that they do not}} taper. Shaped like a <b>toothed</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Precise {{details of}} the {{reduction}} process have not been recorded at Narborough, but the usual procedure was that the bones were first boiled to make them brittle and to remove the fat. The fat would be skimmed off, and used {{for such things as}} coach and cart grease. The bones would be either chopped by hand or put through a <b>toothed</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Either process would reduce the bones to smaller, more manageable pieces. In the final process, the millstones powered by the waterwheel would grind the bone into powder.|$|E
50|$|Spinner - Spinners are {{generally}} larger and heavier than saw blades, and spin {{at a lower}} RPM. Rather than cutting through the opponent, spinners use a heavy bar, studded disc, or <b>toothed</b> <b>cylinder</b> (drum/eggbeater) to strike the opponent with the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass. The mass may spin on either a horizontal or vertical axis, although vertical spinners may have maneuverability problems due to the gyroscopic action of the weapon. The destructive potential of a well-designed spinning weapon requires robust arena containment to prevent shrapnel being thrown into the audience. Three-time BattleBots middleweight champion Hazard was a horizontal bar spinner, while Robot Wars Series 3 runner-up Hypno-Disc was a flywheel spinner.|$|E
5000|$|A later {{innovation}} was the toothed roller-mill. These mills use <b>toothed</b> <b>cylinders</b> made {{of stone}} or metal to grind the apples into pomace. Such mills are portable, and produce a pomace that is finer {{than that of the}} large horse-mills. It was first introduced to England in 1689 by agriculturalist John Worlidge, who adapted it from the sugar-cane crushers used in the West Indies. Yet as of the beginning of the 19th-century, such mills could not handle the same quantity in bulk as the horse-driven mills.|$|R

50|$|In 1988 the Dallas series {{adopted the}} TU engines {{and a more}} modern design from the Citroen AX: the TU3S with Solex 32-34Z body double {{carburetor}} for the 205 XS, developing 85 horsepower. Distribution was now by <b>toothed</b> belt. The <b>cylinder</b> is exactly the same, consumption falls slightly. The TU3S motor is a sports motor by design.|$|R
