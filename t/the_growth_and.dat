5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} have studied <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> life history of tyrannosaurids.

After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. A tyrannosaurid growth curve is S-shaped, with the maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age.|$|E
