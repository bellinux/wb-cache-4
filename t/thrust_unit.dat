40|$|International audienceIn orogenic systems, thrust faults play a {{major role}} in {{stacking}} different tectonic units and may act as conduits for the expulsion of large amounts of fluid of different origins (metamorphic, diagenetic, meteoric). This study focuses on the Monte Perdido <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> emplaced in the Paleogene Jaca thrust-sheet-top basin, in the SW-central Pyrenees. We aim to decipher the mechanisms and P-T conditions of deformation in fault zones and characterize the related fluid involvement, through combined microstructural, geochemical and microthermometry analyses. Two thrust faults cutting platform limestones, marls and siliciclastic turbidites of the lower part of the basin-fill (Paleocene-lower Eocene) have been studied. The fault zones are characterized by metre-thick shear zones with highly deformed, foliated clay-rich sediments. Foliation is underlined by preferentially oriented phyllosilicates. Several generations of shear and extension calcite, quartz and chlorite-bearing veins attest to fluid-rock interactions during a multi-stage deformation. Microstructural observations and stable isotope analyses on calcite from veins and host sediments suggest that deformation was aseismic and dominated by diffusive mass transfer from pressure solution sites along cleavage and stylolites to the precipitation sites in veins, with mineralizing fluids in equilibrium with the host sediments. Our results suggest an essentially closed hydrologic system, and imply the absence of significant fluid flow along the studied fault zones. Microthermometric study on fluid inclusions present in calcite and quartz veins, and calcite-quartz oxygen isotopic fractionation determined for the first generation shear veins, allow a geothermal gradient of 34 degrees C/km to be estimated. Analytical results demonstrate an evolution of the fault zones in three stages. The first stage was related to the emplacement of the Monte Perdido <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> during the middle Eocene at a temperature of similar to 208 degrees C and a burial depth of similar to 5. 7 km. The second stage corresponds to a fault reactivation at a temperature of similar to 240 degrees C and a burial depth of similar to 6. 5 km. The latter deformation may have been related to folding of the Monte Perdido <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> during the emplacement of the underlying Gavarnie <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> during the late Eocene-early Oligocene, with deeper burial resulting from aggradation of the thrust-sheet-top basin-fill.

40|$|SUMMARY: Half of the {{northern}} part of the French Massif Central h s been shown to be allochthonous. In the allochthonous rocks, preserved high-pressure granulites represent an early tectonometamorphic event which took place before thrusting. During the southward-directed overthrusting of this high-grade metamorphic slab a plurifacial inverted metamorphism was developed in the underlying sediments. Adjacent areas how different types of metamorphism in the autochthonous and parautochthonous pelites. The climax of the metamorphism is shown to have been reached bythe end of the thrusting episode. This was followed by the retrogression of the high-grade rocks and the stablish-ment of a low-pressure metamorphism in both the <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> and the autochthonous-parautochthonous terranes beneath. We describe this example of inverted metamorphic zonation associated with the large-scale thrusting of an already metamorphosed series.

40|$|The tectonothermal {{evolution}} {{of an area}} located {{in the core of}} the Ibero-Armorican Arc (Variscan belt) has been determined by using the conodont colour alteration index (CAI), Kübler index of illite (KI), the Árkai index of chlorite (AI) and the analysis of clay minerals and rock cleavage. The area is part of the Cantabrian Zone (CZ), which represents the foreland fold and thrust belt of the orogen. It has been thrust by several large units of the CZ, what resulted in the generation {{of a large number of}} synorogenic Carboniferous sediments. CAI, KI and AI values show an irregular distribution of metamorphic grade, independent of stratigraphic position. Two tectonothermal events have been distinguished in the area. The first one, poorly defined, is mainly located in the northern part. It gave rise to very-low-grade metamorphism in some areas and it was associated with a deformation event that resulted in the emplacement of the last large <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> and development of upright folds and associated cleavage (S 1). The second tectonothermal event gave rise to low-grade metamorphism and cleavage (S 2) crosscutting earlier upright folds in the central, western and southern parts of the study area. The event continued with the intrusion of small igneous rock bodies, which gave rise to contact metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration. This event was linked to an extensional episode due to a gravitational instability at the end of the Variscan deformation. This tectonothermal evolution occurred during the Gzhelian–Sakmarian. Subsequently, several hydrothermal episodes took place and local crenulation cleavage developed during the Alpine deformation...|$|E

To the N, the Chaînons Béarnais belt (CB) is a system of Jurassic to LowerCretaceous carbonate anticline ridges separated by synclines withthick Albian-Cenomanian flysch, covered to the north by Upper Cretaceousflysch sequences. The CB is thrust southwards together with theLakora <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> and northwards onto the Aquitaine basin. CB foldinglargely results from the rising and squeezing of diapirs initiated duringthe Jurassic-Early Cretaceous extension.

Moho reflectionsin the ECORS-Arzaq profile constrain the present deep structure. Restoration leads to a Mesozoic cover detachment over the N-Iberianand S-European margins. Inversion began by subduction of the exhumedmantle and folding and pop-up thrusting of the CB cover onto themargins. From the mid-late Eocene onwards, continental collision wasaccommodated by wedging and thrust stacking in the Iberian crust, involvingthe piggyback formation of S-vergent basement thrusts in theupper crust, and the northward subduction of the lower crust...|$|E

40|$|Thrusting {{fault zone}} in {{foreland}} basins {{are characterized by}} highly foliated zones generally enriched in phyllosilicates which can {{play a major role}} on the mechanical behaviour of the fault. In this context, investigations of synkinematic clay minerals permit to determine the origin of the fluid from which they precipitated as well as the mechanisms of deformation. Our study is focused on clay mineral assemblages (illite and chlorite) in a major thrust fault located in the Monte Perdido massif (southern Pyrenees), a shallow thrust that affects upper cretaceous-paleocene platform carbonates and lower Eocene marls and turbidites. It implied 3 km of displacement of the Monte Perdido <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> with respect to the underlying Gavarnie unit. In this area the cleavage development by pressure-solution is linked to the Monte Perdido and Gavarnie thrust activity. The core zone of the fault, about 6 m thick, consists of an interval of intensely deformed clay-bearing rocks bounded by major shear surfaces. The deformed sediment is markedly darker than the protolith. Calcite-quartz shear veins along the shear planes are abundant. Detailed SEM and TEM observations of highly deformed fault zone samples indicate that clay mineral enrichment in the core zone of the fault is not only related to passive increase by pressure-solution mechanism but that dissolution-recrystallization of phyllosilicates occurs during deformation. A mineral segregation is observed in the highly deformed zone. Newly formed 2 M 1 muscovite is present along the cleavage whereas IIb chlorite crystals fill SV 2 shear veins suggesting syntectonic growth of phyllosilicates in the presence of fluids in low-grade metamorphic conditions. These mineralogical reactions act as weakening processes and would favour Monte Perdido fault creeping...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn fold-and-thrust belts, {{shortening}} {{is mainly}} accommodated by thrust faults which are preferential zones for recrystallisation and mass transfer. This study {{focuses on a}} detachment fault related to the emplacement of the Monte Perdido <b>thrust</b> <b>unit</b> in the southern Pyrenees. The studied fault zone consists of a 10 m thick intensively foliated phyllonite developed within the Millaris marls, of Eocene age. The lithological homogeneity of the hanging wall and footwall allows us to compare the Millaris marls outside the fault zone with the highly deformed marls located in the fault zone and to quantify the chemical, mineralogical and volumetric changes related to deformation processes along the fault. The Millaris marls are composed of detrital quartz, illite, chlorite, minor albite and pyrite, in a micritic calcite matrix. In the fault zone, the cleavage planes are marked by clay minerals and calcite ± chlorite veins attest to fluid-mineral interactions during deformation. The mineral proportions in all samples from both the fault zone and Millaris marls have been quantified by two methods: (1) X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, and (2) bulk chemical analyses as well as microprobe analyses to calculate modal composition. The excellent agreement between {{the results of these}} two methods allows us to estimate mineralogical variations using a modification of the Gresens' equation. During fault activation, up to 45 wt% of calcite was lost while the amounts of quartz and chlorite remained unchanged. Illite content remained constant to slightly enriched. The mineralogical variations were coupled with a significant volume loss (up to 45 %) mostly due to the dissolution of micritic calcite grains. Deformation was accompanied by pressure solution and phyllosilicates recrystallisation. These processes accommodated slip along the fault. They required fluids as catalyst, but they did not necessitate major chemical transfers...|$|E

Aftershock determinations showed events distributed between 1 and 4 km depth in a small active area of about 4 km 2, E-W oriented delineating the southern sector of the Aralar <b>thrust</b> <b>unit.</b> This seismogenic feature is supported by focal solutions showing a consistent E-W nodal plane with normal faulting following the main strike-slip rupture. The Aralar structure with its shallow activity may be interpreted as a conjugate system of the NE-SW deep-seated Pamplona active fault nearby. Cross-correlation techniques and relative location of event clusters further constrained the epicentral domain to 2 km long and 1 km wide. Statistical relations and parameters established indicate a rather low b-value of 0. 8 for the Gutenberg-Richter distribution, denoting a region of concentrated seismicity, and a P-parameter of 0. 9 for the Omori's law corresponding to a low decay of the aftershock activity in this area. More than 100 aftershocks were accurately located in this high-resolution experiment, whereas only 13 of them could be catalogued by the permanent agencies in the same period, due to a much sparser distribution.

However, a more allochthonous alternative using thinner cover sequences is also discussed, which restores the Bahía Honda unit 220 km to the south of its present position. Syntectonic deposits in combination with a forward kinematic model provide a good constraint for the tectonic evolution of the orogen. The internally deformed Bahía Honda unit overthrusted the North America margin cover successions during Danian and Selandian times (~ 65. 5 – 60 Ma), before the stacking of these cover rocks during Selandian and Thanetian times (~ 60 – 56 Ma).

40|$|The report {{presents}} a detailed uncertainty analysis for a podded propulsor open water test. A {{brief overview of}} the uncertainty analysis methodology has been provided, with a particular focus on the elements that are unique to the experiments with podded propulsors. The method used follows that of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standard on Measurement uncertainty and the approach described by Coleman and steele in their 1999 book Experimental and Uncertainty Analysis for Engineers. The variables {{of interest in the}} podded propulsors uncertainty analysis were propeller <b>thrust,</b> <b>unit</b> thrust, propeller torque, forces and moments on the propulsor in the three orthogonal directions, propeller shaft rotational speed, carriage advance speed, azimuthing angle, water density (function of water temperature) and propeller diameter. The uncertainty analysis results of the experiments conducted using the NSERC-NRC dynamometer system were compared to that of a very high quality, well-established equipment (tests done in the IOT towing tank) used to measure the performance of some bare podded propellers and the results from the previous similar tests using the same equipment. Comparison of the results showed that the podded propulsor tests using the NSERC-NRC pod instrumentation in the current phase of tests provided the level of accuracy comparable with the established equipment. The uncertainty levels observed in the propeller thrust and unit thrust in the podded propulsor tests were found to be higher than the thrust uncertainty for the baseline tests, but less than the corresponding uncertainties found in the previous tests done on the same podded propulsors with same operating conditions with the same equipment. For majority of the cases, the primary element of the uncertainty of the performance coefficients was the bias error (90 % or more on the total uncertainty). To reduce the overall uncertainty in the final results, the primary focuses should be to reduce the bias error in the equipment. The uncertainty analysis results provided strong evidence that the experimental data obtained using the NSERC-NRC dynamometer system presented the true performance characteristics of the model scale podded propulsors under consideration. yesPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
