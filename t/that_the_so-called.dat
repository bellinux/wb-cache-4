25|$|Creationists {{argue that}} {{evidence}} for the geological column is fragmentary, and all the complex layers of chalk occurred in the approach to the 150th day of Noah's flood. However, the entire geologic column is found in several places, and shows multiple features, including evidence of erosion and burrowing through older layers, which are inexplicable on a short timescale. Carbonate hardgrounds and the fossils associated with them show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> flood sediments include evidence of long hiatuses in deposition that are not consistent with flood dynamics or timing.|$|E
25|$|Continuing this year’s {{earlier work}} on {{graphics}} performance-related matters, Dolphin developers implemented {{a solution for}} the long-standing problem known as shader compilation stuttering. The stuttering {{is caused by the}} emulator waiting for the graphics driver to compile shaders required for new environments or objects. The solution <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Ubershaders – in development since 2015 – present to the problem was to emulate the Wii’s and GameCube’s rendering pipeline by way of an interpreter running on the host system’s graphics processor itself until a specialized shader has been compiled and can be used for future frames, at a lower cost to performance.|$|E

In explaining Mongoloid cold-adaptiveness, So cites the work of W. L. Hylander (1977) where Hylander said that in the Eskimo (Inuit), for example, the reduction of the brow ridge and flatness of the face is due to internal structural configurations that are cold adapted {{in the sense that they}} produce a large vertical bite force necessary to chew frozen seal meat.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{snow cover}} in {{modulating}} the monsoon {{is just one}} example of a short-term cryosphere-climate feedback involving the land surface and the atmosphere. From Figure 1 {{it can be seen that}} there are numerous cryosphere-climate feedbacks in the global climate system. These operate over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales from local seasonal cooling of air temperatures to hemispheric-scale variations in ice sheets over time-scales of thousands of years. The feedback mechanisms involved are often complex and incompletely understood. For example, Curry et al. (1995) showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> “simple” sea ice-albedo feedback involved complex interactions with lead fraction, melt ponds, ice thickness, snow cover, and sea-ice extent.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 prince Trubetskoy (1813–1889) {{challenged}} Koene's {{story and}} published a different {{explanation of the}} events. According to Trubetskoy, all five test samples were sent to Warsaw {{and ended up in}} the hands of an anonymous Polish plunderer who later emigrated to France. After his death Trubetskoy became his widow's agent; two or three coins were allegedly sold to an American collector and perished in a shipwreck, two remained in Trubetskoy's possession. Russian collectors contested Trubetskoy's account and suspected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Trubetskoy rubles were fake. After World War II Valentin Yanin partially redeemed Trubetskoy: according to Yanin, the legendary shipment of samples to Warsaw was a coverup of Cancrin's invention, rather than Trubetskoy's own hoax.|$|E
25|$|In her 1978 article, Whitney Davis {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> {{depictions of}} human-jaguar copulation on monuments are instead {{the beginnings of}} a jaguar cult or are representative of conquest in battle rather than a sexual conquest. Rather than viewing the people and jaguar-figures in sexual situations, Davis sees the jaguar, or man in jaguar pelts, as an aggressor towards a defeated opponent. Most of the figures in the reliefs and monuments are clothed in loincloths, which would negate copulation, and Davis believes those that are naked appear dead or dying rather than in a sexual posture. It is not uncommon to see unclothed human figures as representative of dead captives or opponents in battle, as in the danzantes of Monte Alban.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 David Deutsch {{showed that}} quantum theory is fully {{consistent}} (in the sense <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> density matrix {{can be made}} free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves. However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as {{it will lead to}} strange phenomena like distinguishing non orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture. Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, the Tübingen School of Plato {{interpretation}} {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, {{at least in}} this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, Territorial Governor John Evans {{appointed}} the Reverend John Chivington as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors who {{were accused of}} stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, {{that most of the}} dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President Andrew Johnson asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the Sand Creek massacre.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers {{were the}} {{suppliers}} and local {{players on the}} demand side. After Stradivari's death, this drastically changed. Although the Cremonese luthiers remained the suppliers, the demand side consisted of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers and speculators. Many local players {{could no longer afford}} the sought out instruments and most of the purchased instruments would be hidden in private collections, put in museums, or would be simply put back in their cases, hoping that they would gain value over time. It is then <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> 'fever' for Stradivaris took off. Cozio, Tarisio and Vuillaume were the fathers of this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century. Also, soon after Stradivari's death, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers would die, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona's violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis.|$|E
25|$|The 1918 season showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> 'Association game' {{was in a}} {{state of}} flux, with the {{competition}} being contested by at least 22 Brisbane teams, many of which were from new clubs (it is unclear whether the competition included separate 'divisions').

It is noteworthy that there was significant ground sharing by a number of clubs (e.g., at least four clubs at Pineapple/Raymond Park and at least three clubs at Milton). It is also noteworthy that during the Great War the Ipswich teams once again did not play in the QBFA Brisbane competition, with at least some of those teams re-joining by the 1921 season (as noted below).|$|E
