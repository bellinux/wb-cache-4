500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
2500|$|Austin {{was said}} to have played a pivotal role in the Atkinson switch and there was some {{speculation}} that Austin's connections to The White House might propel him in a future run for Congress. The Pittsburgh Press wrote, [...] "Somehow, all of the television network commentators, the syndicated political columnists and the Capitol Hill pundits who rushed to analyze, dissect and expatiate upon the Atkinson political drama neglected to point out the McKeesport connection. He is Robb Austin, the man many people here <b>think</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> eminence grise behind Atkinson's defection. Austin is now Atkinson's top administrative aide, but back {{along the banks of the}} Monongahela he will be remembered as a former state legislator who was young, attractive, ambitious – and who nonetheless served only one term." ...|$|E
