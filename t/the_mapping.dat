50|$|Place Editor.

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> problem {{refers to}} the {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

30|$|The {{first step}} of trace {{processing}} is filtering. The filtered trace is then addressed to <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> Matching, where GPS points are matched to <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> {{in order to find}} the existing segments on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> <b>The</b> matched points of the trace are used to update the existing segments on <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> which thus improves road precision. The non-matched points of the trace are aggregated on to <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> creating new roads (or trajectories). Two databases are then generated from this process; <b>the</b> <b>map</b> database and <b>the</b> statistics database. These databases serve to provide data for external services such as route planning and traffic analysis. For more information on the YouTrace project, please refer to [7]. As can be understood, <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> Matching is a key element for YouTrace, which is entirely responsible for finding the parts of the trace that already exist on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> This allows for the distinction between the parts that should be aggregated and those that should be updated, therefore the quality of <b>the</b> final <b>map</b> is dependable {{of the quality of the}} match.|$|R

The authorship of <b>the</b> <b>map</b> has also been debated, while <b>the</b> <b>map</b> is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilseman, who took part in both of Tasman’s voyages.
