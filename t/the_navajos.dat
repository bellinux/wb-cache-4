5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to <b>the</b> <b>Navajos.</b>|$|E
5|$|In pre-Columbian times, the Lees Ferry {{area was}} {{inhabited}} first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, {{followed by the}} Archaic culture, which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, who left more evidence of habitation in the valley, arrived {{only in the last}} 1,000 years or so. Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.|$|E
