30|$|Here, {{we present}} our {{work on the}} heating-enhanced (HE) dynamic DEP process for aligned SWCNT film of {{ultrahigh}} density. We think the SWCNTs far from DEP grooves and beyond the DEP force’s ability {{can be taken to}} <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> DEP grooves by the convection induced by intentional heating and then are captured by the DEP force, resulting in much higher alignment density of SWCNTs than the case without heating. The simulation work suggests that the heating-induced convection takes the SWCNTs beyond 100  μm far away from DEP grooves to <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> DEP grooves. We assumed that DEP force is equal to the “convection force” at the boundaries of the SWCNTs-gathering areas in <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> DEP grooves, based on which the convection force can be assessed with DEP force.|$|R

It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged {{by the failure of}} its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E

40|$|Some {{species of}} plant-mutualistic ants kill the {{vegetation}} growing in <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> their host plant, creating {{an area of}} bare ground (clearing). The reduced competition in the clearing may facilitate the establishment of host species sprouts (clones and seedlings), which in turn benefits the ants with additional food and shelter (“sprout-establishment hypothesis”). To test this hypothesis, the density and origin of Acacia collinsii sprouts growing inside clearings and in <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> acacia plants without clearings were compared. Also, to assess the pruning selectivity of acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola), seedlings were transplanted into clearings. The reaction of ants towards unrewarding acacia seedlings (without food and shelter) was also tested. The density of acacia sprouts growing inside clearings was almost twice that in <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> host plants without clearings, and sprouts were inhabited by nestmates of the colony that made the clearing. Clones and seedlings were found in similar proportions in the clearings, and ants did not kill unrewarding acacia seedlings or seedlings unrelated to their host. The benefit reported here for the ants could be {{in conflict with the}} host plant, especially when the plant has rhizomal reproduction...|$|R
