40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{differences}} associated to the change of biofuel used to cook as a way to estimate the proportion of respiratory abnormalities of respiratory function associated to biomass exposure. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the respiratory function through spirometry in subjects cooking with biomass or natural gas. All patientswere evaluated by a general physician and a pulmonologist. We compared the prevalence of spirometry abnormalities across those cooking with natural gas versus those cooking with biofuel. A multivariable logistic regression and multiple linear regression were used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>differences</b> by potential confounding factors. Results 203 subjects were studied. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of severe obstructive pattern (OR 5. 50; 95 % CI 1. 17 - 25. 79) in subjects who cook with biomass compared with natural gas users. Values of forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were statistically lower among those cooking with biomass. The prevalence of respiratory morbidity and symptoms were not statistically significant between both groups. Conclusions These findings suggest that replacing biomass fuel by natural gas may be an important public health intervention in Colombia, because it can reduce the prevalence of abnormal patterns of pulmonary function...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{privilege}} to present these comments at a symposium that honors Otmar Issing. I join those who have congratulated him on the guidance and leadership that he gave {{to the introduction of}} the euro and its establishment as a stable currency. I am one of those who was skeptical about a single currency for Europe. I did not oppose the idea. Skepticism concerned the wisdom of eliminating exchange and interest rate changes <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>differences</b> between countries. The system put too much emphasis on labor and product price adjustment, the principal and practically speaking the only market adjustment left. Along with many others, I argued that the new system would only achieve full employment and price stability if countries substantially modified their costly welfare and regulatory systems. Otmar’s rejoinder was that these structural changes had to occur in any case and that removing monetary policy responses would focus attention on the need for structural changes. Otmar Issing and others at the ECB deserve credit for maintaining price stability despite the slow pace of structural reform and high unemployment rates in the principal member countries.

40|$|Subjects reconstructed {{two sets}} of {{scrambled}} discourse consisting of 26 sentences each. Subjects were given either no feedback or limited feedback as confirmation-disconfirmation, with retrieval either immediate or delayed one week. Memory was {{measured in terms of}} recall of idea units and recognition of original sentences from paraphrases. Concordance was measured by relationship to the original sentence order. Recall scores were not related to any of the independent variables, while recognition scores were related to content. The data sugest a modest contribution of feedback to concordance, but this did not result in achievement differences. The findings replicate previous research which suggests that subjects used feedback to assist idiosyncratic strategies and knowledge using local syntactical cues and coherence. In terms of instructional development appropriate feedback appears to be more situation-specific than previously assessed. Instructional developers consider feedback to be a critical adjunct aid to learning {e. g., Anderson & Faust, 1973). Indeed, everyday experiences would confirm that given some assistance and direction, most learners benefit. Generally, feedback is used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>differences</b> between the content of the instructional program developer and perceived student outcomes. Almost invariably feedback is assumed to follow the student response with a direct and predictable effect; i. e., assisting the learner in establishing a higher degree of concordance between learning outcomes and the a priori logic of the author.

50|$|A major {{difference}} between rebreather diving and open-circuit scuba diving is in controlling neutral buoyancy. When an open-circuit scuba diver inhales, a quantity of highly compressed gas from his cylinder is reduced in pressure by a regulator, and enters the lungs {{at a much higher}} volume than it occupied in the cylinder. This means that the diver has a tendency to rise slightly with each inhalation, and sink slightly with each exhalation. This does not happen to a rebreather diver, because the diver is circulating a roughly constant volume of gas between his lungs and the breathing bag. This is not specifically an advantage or disadvantage, but it requires some practice <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the <b>difference.</b>|$|R

40|$|Context For {{evidence-based}} {{practice to}} embed culturally in the workplace, teaching of evidence-based medicine(EBM) should be clinically integrated. In low-middle-in come countries (LMICs) {{there is a}} scarcity of EBM-trained clinical tutors, lack of protected time for teaching EBM, and poor access to relevant databases in languages other than English. Objective To evaluate {{the effects of a}} clinically integrated e-learning EBM course incorporating the World Health Organization(WHO) Reproductive Health Library(RHL) on knowledge, skills, and educational environment compared with traditional EBM teaching. Design, Setting, and Participants International cluster randomized trial conducted between April 2009 and November 2010 among postgraduate trainees in obstetrics-gynecology in 7 LMICs (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand). Each training unit was randomized to an experimental clinically integrated course consisting of e-modules using the RHL for learning activities and trainee assessments (31 clusters, 123 participants) or to a control self-directed EBM course incorporating the RHL (29 clusters, 81 participants). A facilitator with EBM teaching experience was available at all teaching units. Courses were administered for 8 weeks, with assessments at baseline and 4 weeks after course completion. The study was completed in 24 experimental clusters (98 participants) and 22 control clusters (68 participants). Main Outcome Measures Primary outcomes were change in EBM knowledge (score range, 0 - 62) and skills (score range, 0 - 14). Secondary outcome was educational environment (5 -point Likert scale anchored between 1 [strongly agree] and 5 [strongly disagree]). Results At baseline, the study groups were similar in age, year of training, and EBM-related attitudes and knowledge. After the trial, the experimental group had higher mean scores in knowledge (38. 1 [95 % CI, 36. 7 to 39. 4] in the control group vs 43. 1 [95 % CI, 42. 0 to 44. 1] in the experimental group; <b>adjusted</b> <b>difference,</b> 4. 9 [95 % CI, 2. 9 to 6. 8]; P<. 001) and skills (8. 3 [95 % CI, 7. 9 to 8. 7] vs 9. 1 [95 % CI, 8. 7 <b>to</b> 9. 4]; <b>adjusted</b> <b>difference,</b> 0. 7 [95 % CI, 0. 1 to 1. 3]; P=. 02).
