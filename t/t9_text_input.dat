One can bring up a standard keypad with letters and use multi-tap (<b>T9</b> (predictive <b>text))</b> or a word-guessing system. If the phone is turned sideways, it senses the change in orientation and brings up a full keyboard. Also of note is a handwriting feature which allows the user to write numbers or letters by writing with a finger. In each of these modes, the user must manually change the setting (capital or lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols) to allow the phone to know what type of character is being input.|$|R

The paper begins with a historical overview of <b>text</b> <b>input</b> research and then widens the discussion to consider the effects on the research results of different users and different technologies. A framework is proposed for future verification of phrase sets and a small empirical study is described that provides evidence that the framework has potential. 1 <b>Text</b> <b>Input</b> Research We spend {{a significant amount of}} time carrying out <b>text</b> <b>input</b> activities.

It is therefore, unsurprising that most of the work on <b>text</b> <b>input</b> has focussed on these two paradigms.

40|$|Mobile {{computing}} devices, {{in particular}} smartphones are powered from Lithium-ion batteries, which {{are limited in}} capacity. With the increasing popularity of mobile systems, various <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods {{have been developed to}} improve user experience and performance. Briefly, <b>text</b> <b>input</b> method is a user interface {{that can be used to}} compose an electronic mail, configure mobile Virtual Private Network, and carryout bank transactions and online purchases. Efficient energy management in these systems requires an extensive knowledge of where and how the energy is being used. This thesis investigates the energy consumption of <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods on various smartphones. Hence, the authors modeled the energy consumption profile of <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods on smartphones and analyze the energy usage benchmarks of the battery. This thesis presents a systematic technique to conduct application specific measurements. The data analysis showed substantial variations in the energy consumptions of various <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods on a smartphone. The main objective of this research is to find a systematic and measurement based method to evaluate the energy efficiency of the selected <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods used on smartphones namely: SwiftKey, Swype, and Zimpl. Using Power Monitor equipment and MATLAB, the energy consumption log files of the <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods were collected for each of the smartphones, and analyzed. This research introduces an optimized technique to carry-out application specific test on smartphones. It is hoped that the thesis will be beneficial to smartphone battery manufacturers and developers of <b>text</b> <b>input</b> techniques on how to make usersâ€™ smartphone battery last longer...|$|R
40|$|Information {{technology}} plays a {{very important}} role in society. People with disabilities are often limited by slow <b>text</b> <b>input</b> speed despite the use of assistive devices. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a dynamic on-screen keyboard (Custom Virtual Keyboard) and a word-prediction system (Sibylle) on <b>text</b> <b>input</b> speed in participants with functional tetraplegia. Ten participants tested four modes at home (static on-screen keyboard with and without word prediction and dynamic on-screen keyboard with and without word prediction) for 1 mo before choosing one mode and then using it for another month. Initial mean <b>text</b> <b>input</b> speed was around 23 characters per minute with the static keyboard and 12 characters per minute with the dynamic keyboard. The results showed that the dynamic keyboard reduced <b>text</b> <b>input</b> speed by 37 % compared with the standard keyboard and that the addition of word prediction had no effect on <b>text</b> <b>input</b> speed.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{nature of}} grocery shopping {{makes it an}} interesting domain for intelligent mobile assistants. Even though {{the central role of}} shopping lists is widely recognized, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} facilitating shopping list creation and management. In this paper we introduce a predictive <b>text</b> <b>input</b> technique that is based on association rules and item frequencies. We also describe an interface design for integrating the predictive <b>text</b> <b>input</b> with a web-based mobile shopping assistant. In a user study we compared two interfaces, one with <b>text</b> <b>input</b> support and one without. Our results indicate that, even though shopping list entries are typically short, our technique makes <b>text</b> <b>input</b> significantly faster, decreases typing error rates and increases overall user satisfaction.

40|$|Via the use {{of mobile}} phones, the Short Message Service (SMS) is {{the one of the}} most {{important}} mobile applications for communication between two or more people. Moreover, the effectiveness on typing messages needed to be improved in the area of the typing performance. When the typing performance is low, people might get frustrated. There are several <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods in mobile phones. The study is conducted based on three <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods such as T 9 method. Multi-press with next button and Multipress with timeout method. However, there are problems caused by these three methods towards mobile phone application. There are numerous errors when typing messages using <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods. Moreover, some <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods are just too expensive and these methods take so much space in mobile phones' memory. Therefore, a lot of investigations or research must be done to determine which <b>text</b> <b>input</b> method that is able to gain more interest among stakeholders. Moreover, the new prototype recommended will be able to overcome the problems caused by existing <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods. The purpose of the study for this research is to experiment the typical <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods which are commonly used in mobile phones and also to determine the problems of typing messages which occur in many mobile applications. From this research, it is hoped that the new prototype which has been proposed can overcome the problems of typing messages. The methodologies used in this research are distributing questiormaires to one hundred and fifty one (151) students of the Faculty of Information Technology and Quantative, UiTM Shah Alam, as mobile application users. Moreover, this research has conducted an experiment involving six (6) of students as the test subjects. Based on the methodologies, the comparative results of the three <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods are validated systematically. But more researches should be conducted in order to gain better information and find solutions to improve the functions of <b>text</b> <b>input</b> methods. Last but not least, it is also hoped that the users will enjoy better mobile application that they use in their daily lives...|$|R
