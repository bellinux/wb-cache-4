5|$|Upon {{crossing}} Lower State Road, PA463 fully enters Horsham Township {{and becomes}} a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it heads past housing subdivisions. The route loses the <b>turning</b> <b>lane</b> and continues southeast to PA152 {{in the village of}} Prospectville. At this intersection, PA463 gains a center left-turn lane again and passes a few businesses before continuing past Deep Meadow Park and Kohler Park. The road intersects Keith Valley Road and passes near Samuel Carpenter Park. At the Babylon Road junction, the route becomes a five-lane road and runs to the northeast of Hatboro-Horsham Senior High School and past business parks before coming to Privet Road. At this point, PA463 runs past the Horsham Air Guard Station to the northeast and homes and businesses to the southwest. The route reaches the edge of the air station property at the Maple Avenue intersection. PA 463 intersects Dresher Road, where the center left-turn lane ends and the road becomes four lanes, reaching its eastern terminus at PA611 in the community of Horsham. At the eastern terminus, access from PA 463 to northbound PA 611 is provided by Dresher Road.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{for this}} {{expansion}} were first conceptualized in 1979 when a planning study was undertaken. However, budgetary constraints forced an early {{end to this}} study in 1981. In 1988, the project was reinstated. A study released that year recommended that Highway7 be widened to five lanes with a centre <b>turning</b> <b>lane</b> south of Carleton Place as an interim measure; this {{was carried out in}} 1993.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the {{intersection}} with Ocean Reef Road (SR84) was upgraded. A second left <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> was added for drivers entering Ocean Reef Road westbound from Wanneroo Road from the North, a second right <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> to enter Ocean Reef Road westbound, {{and a second}} left and right <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> at Ocean Reef Road (westbound).|$|R
50|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>lanes</b> can {{increase}} the capacity of an intersection and/or improve safety. <b>Turn</b> <b>lanes</b> can have a dramatic effect on {{the safety of a}} junction. In rural areas, crash frequency can be reduced by up to 48% if left <b>turn</b> <b>lanes</b> are provided on both main-road approaches at stop-controlled intersections. At signalized intersections, crashes can be reduced by 33%. Results are slightly lower in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|At intersections {{with large}} {{proportions}} of <b>turning</b> traffic, <b>turn</b> <b>lanes</b> (also known as turn bays) may be provided. For example, in the intersection {{shown in the}} diagram, left <b>turn</b> <b>lanes</b> {{are present in the}} right-left street.|$|R
25|$|The {{main road}} in Embrun is Notre-Dame Street (County Road 3). This busy street travels eastâ€“west across Embrun, linking its neighbourhoods together. At its western end it connects to Castor Street in {{neighbouring}} Russell, while its eastern end {{travels to the}} nearby village of Casselman, located 12km to the east. As Embrun grows, the street has experienced significant congestion. Part of this is aggravated by the fact that, {{with the exception of}} a 1km section in western Embrun which has a centre <b>turning</b> <b>lane,</b> the street is still a conventional two lane street. The municipality has studied the possibility of widening the entire stretch of the street to two lanes in each direction with a centre <b>turning</b> <b>lane,</b> however the cost of this is seen as prohibitive, so instead, the municipality has focused on projects to make traffic flow more efficient. This included the upgrading of intersections, including the installation of new left-turn signals at two intersections (completed in 2011) and the replacement of another intersection with a roundabout (completed in 2012).|$|E
25|$|At {{the county}} line, NY25B breaks from its {{previous}} east-northeast alignment {{and takes a}} more pronounced northeast routing through New Hyde Park. The road narrows as well, decreasing to four lanes excluding the center <b>turning</b> <b>lane,</b> with an extended shoulder taking {{the place of the}} two lost lanes. A half-mile from the county line, NY25B enters North New Hyde Park, intersecting Lakeville Road in the center. Two blocks from Lakeville, the commercial buildings give way to residential dwellings for seven blocks before returning at the intersection of New Hyde Park Road and Hillside Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Hillside Avenue changes designations from NY25 to NY25B at an {{intersection}} with Braddock Avenue in the Queens neighborhood of Queens Village. Here, NY25 turns right onto Braddock while NY25B begins and follows Hillside Avenue to the northeast. The road, a six-lane divided highway with a large, tree-lined median {{in the vicinity}} of the junction with Braddock Avenue, begins to narrow after intersecting 229th Street, passing the Martin Van Buren High School as the median is reduced to a single <b>turning</b> <b>lane.</b> At 232nd Street, the street turns to the east for three blocks before curving to the southeast at Winchester Boulevard.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages to <b>turn</b> <b>lanes</b> include {{increased}} pavement area, with associated {{increases in}} construction and maintenance costs, {{as well as}} increased amounts of stormwater runoff. They also increase the distance over which pedestrians crossing the street are exposed to vehicle traffic. If a <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> has a separate signal phase, it often increases the delay experienced by oncoming through traffic. Without a separate phase, left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the <b>turn</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{route is}} two-lanes in width for its entire route with the {{exception}} of <b>turning</b> <b>lanes</b> at some intersections and a center <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> between SR 39 and Slingloff Avenue. SR 211 is not included {{as a part of the}} National Highway System.|$|R
50|$|The road is two lanes for {{its entire}} length, {{except for a}} four-lane stretch with center <b>turn</b> <b>lanes</b> {{measuring}} approximately 1+1/2 mi near its eastern end in Bourbonnais. A center <b>turn</b> <b>lane</b> also exists within a two-lane section for a few blocks inside the city of Wilmington.|$|R
25|$|These roundabouts do {{not form}} a {{complete}} circle {{and have a}} raindrop or teardrop shape. They appear at U.S. Interstate interchanges to provide a free-flowing left turn to the on-ramps and {{eliminating the need for}} turn signals and lanes. Since the entry and exit slip roads are one-way, a complete circle is unnecessary. This means that drivers entering the roundabout from the bridge do not need to give way, and that prevents queuing on narrow, two-lane bridges. These roundabouts have been used at dumbbell roundabout junctions, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a <b>turning</b> <b>lane.</b> Several junctions along Interstate 70 near Avon, Colorado use teardrop roundabouts.|$|E
500|$|SR104Spur {{begins its}} short, [...] route as 244th Street at SR104 on the SnohomishKing county line between Edmonds and Shoreline. 244th Street travels west on the 5-lane roadway (including a center <b>turning</b> <b>lane)</b> {{north of the}} Aurora Village {{shopping}} center to end at an intersection with Aurora Avenue, signed as SR99. The highway was originally part of SSH2B from 1937 to 1964 and SR104 after the 1964 highway renumbering and was created in 2009 after SR104 was realigned onto a new divided highway. WSDOT estimated that between 18,000 and 19,000 vehicles per day used the spur route, according to AADT data in 2011.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} future {{developments}} for Route 33. Heavy traffic and recent studies hint at a possible widening of Route 33 {{all the way}} to Route 34 in Wall Township, however this is still only in the proposal phase. [...] Monmouth County is performing a corridor study on Route 33 to determine if any action should happen. There is a planned Route 33 bypass of Robbinsville Township that will run from Washington Boulevard and link up with U.S. Route 130 at South Gold Drive. The former alignment of Route 33 will likely become a Main Street for the new Washington Town Center. Route 33 is being widened from Route 35 to Route 71 in Neptune to provide a center <b>turning</b> <b>lane</b> as well as shoulders. [...] Signals will be modified to provide proper movements.|$|E

2500|$|US167 and LA10 enter Ville Platte on West Main Street as an {{undivided}} four-lane highway with center <b>turning</b> <b>lane,</b> but {{the roadway}} soon separates to follow Main Street eastbound and LaSalle Street westbound, becoming a divided four-lane highway. [...] Passing through the commercial section of town, the highway crosses the Acadiana Railway (AKDN) tracks and intersects LA29 (South Chataignier Street).
