5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from {{the moon}} of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes {{the rank of}} each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E

J.Crew is an American clothing and accessories retailer.|$|E
60|$|A {{long strip}} of wood fell to his ax--long enough to require cutting in two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his eye--letters carved in the wood. He looked closer. The letters were very faintly and badly cut. He could only make out the first three of them; and even of those he was not quite certain. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> C L A--if <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> anything.

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they are wearing armor, {{as they have}} two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} in complex analysis, a Riemann surface, first studied by and named after Bernhard Riemann, is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Riemann surfaces {{can be thought}} of as deformed versions of the complex plane: locally near every point <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together.|$|E
25|$|Levonorgestrel-releasing implant is {{implanted}} {{under the}} skin in the upper arm of a woman, by creating a small incision and inserting the capsules in a fanlike shape.
