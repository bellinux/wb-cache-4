Our database consists of monthly observations of 128 common stocks from April 1996 to October 2014. We aggregate data to study the market-wide relationships between turnover, returns and volatility. Using contemporaneous relations, bivariate vector autoregression (VAR), Granger causality test and impulse response functions, we find that market turnover is positively related to contemporaneous and past returns, which we interpret {{as evidence of the}} mixture of distributions hypothesis (MDH) and the investor overconfidence hypothesis. This suggests that stock returns help forecast volume. However, there is weaker evidence regarding the informative content of trading volume when forecasting returns...|$|E

First, high <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks</b> tend to have stronger momentum, {{which can not be}} explained by under-reaction model. Second, a new liquidity measure developed by Liu (2006) is negatively related to price momentum. Third, when controlled for firm size, firms with more institutional ownership tend to exhibit higher momentum, particular in small firms.

Prior to running causality tests, the time series properties of the data are carefully investigated and special attention {{is given to the}} choice of optimal lag order. Granger causality tests, based on the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) procedure, reveal that there is no causal relationship between the variables in the Czech Republic. In Hungary, there is a bidirectional causality irrespective of volume or market turnover tested. In Poland, while there is bidirectional causality between stock prices and volume, there exists a unidirectional causality running from market turnover to stock prices. The stock prices unidirectionally cause both volume and market turnover without any feedback in the case of Russia and Turkey. These results have important implications regarding market efficiency and the effects of different market characteristics on the stock price/volume relation.

A factor that influences the company’s revenues is the control of its inventories.   The {{purpose of the current}} study was to analyze which of the two options, leasing or owning your inventory, that could be justified from an economical perspective. Furthermore, the purpose was to describe the optimal inventory level for each option.   To meet these objectives representatives for the company was interviewed and a thorough investigation process was undertaken, during which methodological problems were solved.    It was found that leasing the inventory was the most expensive option for the company. Analysis demonstrated that optimal turnover inventory according to EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) would amount to 65, 0 thousand Swedish Krona if the company leases their inventory in comparison to 56, 0 thousand Swedish Krona if the company owned their inventory.

Based on a simple model, the authors predict that financial liberalization, by equalizing access to credit, reduces the variation in expected marginal returns. They test this prediction using a new financial liberalization index and firm-level data for five emerging markets: India, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand.

Forty minutes earlier, investors {{were informed that}} the number of transactions on that day had reached the daily capacity of the exchange’s computer systems. Further, the exchange disclosed that upgrading its technology would take six to twelve months, that the exchange would shut down automatically on any day in which the daily capacity had been reached, and that the exchange would close half an hour early each day in the near future {{to reduce the risk of}} an unanticipated shutdown. I estimate that over the six month period following the January 18 event, the expected number of additional market closures is 1. 5 and the probability of at least one additional shutdown is 70 percent.

Stocks that only trade on the TSE lost a statistically significant 2 percent of their value relative to those that trade on the TSE and at least one additional Japanese exchange. Also, liquid stocks lost value relative to illiquid stocks. For instance, high <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks</b> lost approximately 6 percent of their value relative to low <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks</b> and liquid stocks, as measured by the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, lost approximately 4 percent of their value relative to illiquid stocks.

The conceptual merits and key preconditions of MSD are first reviewed. Then, {{the extent to}} which emerging markets satisfy these preconditions—among them the monitorability of bank assets, the presence of nonbank financial investors, and liquid and “clean” capital markets—are evaluated. We find that emerging markets do not satisfy the preconditions for the successful implementation of a MSD policy. Therefore, efforts to enhance market discipline should first focus on satisfying these preconditions and improving the overall incentive environment and market infrastructure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: While {{numerous}} {{studies have examined the}} determinants of trading volume, we document new evidence that stocks with relatively high (low) turnover in a given year tend to maintain relatively high (low) turnover for the subsequent 20 years. This persistent preference for trading high <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks</b> suggests that investors have strong liquidity preference. To further show that investor trading preference on individual firms is largely formed very early on when their stocks became publicly traded, we use initial turnover and find that it dominates all the previously identified trading volume determinants in explaining future turnover. Our findings imply that Amihud and Mendelson‟s (1986) clientele effect is very persistent, i. e., short-term investors persistently trade liquidity stocks, while long-term investors persistently hold illiquid stocks. Also, Booth and Chua‟s (1996) liquidity-purchasing theory of IPO underpricng is relevant because initial turnover has long-lasting impacts on future liquidity...|$|R
30|$|The {{firm level}} control {{variables}} include firm size, {{return on assets}} (ROA), MTB ratio, <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> and leverage. Firm size is measured using the logarithm of total assets. ROA is the return on assets calculated as earnings per share scaled by year end stock price. MTB is the market to book ratio calculated as market capitalization divided by book value of total assets. Leverage is total liabilities over total assets. <b>Stock</b> <b>turnover</b> is the yearly trading volume divided by market capitalization. Although <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> could {{be considered as a}} proxy for information asymmetry, it also includes other impacts in additional to liquidity. For example, information asymmetry impacts liquidity and turnover but turnover can also directly impact liquidity if investors have different expectations on information available. In any case, turnover is not a standard information asymmetry proxy used in past literature (Fu et al. 2012). As the firms come from very different industries such as oil & gas, basic materials, industrials, consumer goods, health care, consumer services, telecommunications, utilities, financials and technology etc., firm fixed effects are also incorporated into the results.|$|R

I derive two extensions of the Campbell (1991) return decomposition and decompose contemporaneous returns into revisions in expectations, or news, about future dividends, liquidity, and net discount rates. The two decompositions consider, respectively, news about future proportional costs and news about future fixed costs. Using the decompositions, I find that (i) both fixed cost and proportional cost news are substantially more volatile than contemporaneous proportional costs, (ii) fixed cost news is an economically important contributor to portfolio volatility and proportional cost news is not, (iii) small and illiquid stocks have more volatile proportional and fixed cost news and low <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks</b> have more volatile proportional cost news risk and less volatile fixed cost news, and (iv) the market price of risk for both fixed and proportional cost news, estimated within the Liquidity-Adjusted CAPM framework of Acharya and Pedersen (2005), is not statistically different than the price of non-liquidity risk...|$|R

Our analysis supports their hypothesis employing intraday order book data. We find that stronger order flow herding is driven by lower transactions cost. Herding tend to occur in trading of high-cap, high <b>turnover</b> <b>stocks,</b> which contradicts prediction of the information cascade hypothesis. Information cascade effect, if any, is actually stronger near market close than at open. Therefore our study suggests that herding could be related more to intrinsic search cost structure of investors rather than information related factors. ...|$|R
40|$|The retail grocery {{industry}} is serviced by truck wholesalers known as vendors, delivery persons, or route salespersons. The merchandise delivered by these individuals supplements central grocery distribution center deliveries {{and consists of}} items such as beer, soft drinks, potato chips, bread, and milk. Such transactions {{are referred to as}} direct store deliveries (DSD) with products coming directly from an independent distributor rather than from a central grocery warehouse. The retail food {{industry is}} more susceptible to delivery problems than other retail sectors because of high <b>stock</b> <b>turnover.</b> High <b>stock</b> <b>turnover</b> increases the number of direct store deliveries, and as a result, increases opportunities for vendors to steal. Opportunity to steal is one of five separate but interrelated theoretical paradigms identified by Hollinger and Clark (1985) as being used to explain workplace theft. As explained by this set of hypotheses, almost every employee can be tempted to steal from his or her employer (Astor 1972, Henry 1982). The key to understanding why employees may take company money or property lies in knowing the relative levels of opportunity available to them to steal (Hemphill 1969, Hollinger and Clark 1985). Thus, one element in reducing employee theft, according to this theory, consists of constraining opportunities to steal in the work environment.

This paper empirically examines the effect of this exogenous, institutional change in tax policy on stock trading volume in the Japanese market. To do so, we use panel data of stocks traded in both the Japanese and United States markets and compare changes in their trading volumes at the times of the tax changes. We use a well-established V-shape relationship between turnover and price change, with three different assumptions as regards how the price change relates to <b>turnover</b> across <b>stocks</b> and markets. Although a model allowing for both slope and intercept shifts does not offer any indications one way or the other, a more restricted model allowing only for an intercept shift clearly suggests a statistically significant increase in trading volume in the Japanese market but not in the United States markets for April 1999. However, such a result was not obtained for April 1996. These results indicate that the abolition of turnover tax in 1999, but not the rate reduction in 1996, contributed to the trading volume increase.
