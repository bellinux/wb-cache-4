5|$|The Obscene Publications Act 1959 (c. 66) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament that {{significantly}} reformed the law related to obscenity in England and Wales. Prior {{to the passage}} of the Act, the law on publishing obscene materials was governed by the common law case of R v Hicklin, which had no exceptions for artistic merit or the public good. During the 1950s, the Society of Authors formed a committee to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. After several failed attempts <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>a</b> bill through Parliament, a committee finally succeeded in creating a viable bill, which was introduced to Parliament by Roy Jenkins and given the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, coming into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959. With the committee consisting of both censors and reformers, the actual reform of the law was limited, with several extensions to police powers included in the final version.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was developed}} by Ole Herman Johannes Krag, with vital help from his friend Axel Petersson on the actuation of the mechanism. Ole H. J. Krag had been experimenting with repeating rifles for several years before he designed the Krag–Petersson rifle. His earlier models were actuated by a side-mounted lever working an interior crankshaft. Moving the lever in a half circle, counter-clockwise, made the breechblock – {{the part of the}} mechanism that seals the rear of the barrel – move back and down. The rearward movement of the breechblock automatically ejected the spent round and the downward movement allowed the magazine follower <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>a</b> new round into the breech. In 1871, Axel Petersson suggested changing the design to allow the hammer to operate the breechblock instead, thus making the mechanism both simpler and easier to operate. The Krag–Petersson, like Krag's previous design, featured a tubular magazine under the barrel.|$|E

25|$|Wiman {{wanted to}} extend the line to Saint George so {{that all of the}} {{branches}} now under the company's control could meet in one place with the ferries to Manhattan. However, there was a problem: over most of the course of the line, it had followed the shore, along the bluffs, where ground had to be made upon to build the road. State laws were not able to grant the right to run a railroad through the property of the United States, and as a result, construction was hindered by the grounds of the lighthouse department just above Tompkinsville. The company, however, secured an act of congress permitting them <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>a</b> tunnel through the hill a short distance back from the shore. The grant for the tunnel was surrounded with restrictions that made slow progress inevitable. Construction of the tunnel began in 1885. The tunnel was five hundred and eighty five feet long, and was protected by massive walls of masonry on the sides, and an arch of brick two feet in thickness overhead. It was wide enough to fit two trains side by side at a time. The cost of the project was $190,000. On November 16, 1884, Wiman, James M. Davis, Sir Roderick Cameron, Herman Clark, and Louis de Jonge incorporated the Saint George Improvement Company in order to handle the land and waterfront, which was recently purchased from the estate of George Law. The new company was to handle the building of a new terminal for ferries at Saint George.|$|E
