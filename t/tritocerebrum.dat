25|$|The {{classical}} {{view was}} that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the <b>tritocerebrum),</b> a view based partly {{on the fact that}} the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the <b>tritocerebrum</b> in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in mites and spiders, and neuroanatomy in Limulus. If this is the case, then chelicerates simply have no <b>tritocerebrum,</b> i.e. there is no third supraoesophageal ganglion of the brain; the segment corresponding to it would be the suboesophageal pedipalp one. Such a theory does not, however, immediately account for the same ganglionic innervation of the chelicerae and labrum, although one solution is simply to claim that the labrum itself is not homologous between mandibulates and chelicerates (the view, for example, of Dieter Waloszek and colleagues).|$|E

If the labrum is an appendage then, it seems possible that its origin is indicated by its developmentally anterior position, i.e., that it is the appendage of a segment anterior to the first antenna.

40|$|AbstractSubdivision of the neuroectoderm into {{discrete}} {{gene expression}} domains {{is essential for}} the correct specification of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during central nervous system development. Here, we extend our knowledge on dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila brain and uncover novel genetic interactions that control expression of the evolutionary conserved homeobox genes ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), and muscle segment homeobox (msh). We show that cross-repression between Ind and Msh stabilizes the border between intermediate and dorsal <b>tritocerebrum</b> and deutocerebrum, and that both transcription factors are competent to inhibit vnd expression. Conversely, Vnd segment-specifically affects ind expression; it represses ind in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> but positively regulates ind in the deutocerebrum by suppressing Msh. These data provide further evidence that in the brain, in contrast to the trunc, the precise boundaries between DV gene expression domains are largely established through mutual inhibition. Moreover, we find that the segment-polarity gene engrailed (en) regulates the expression of vnd, ind, and msh in a segment-specific manner. En represses msh and ind but maintains vnd expression in the deutocerebrum, is required for down-regulation of Msh in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> to allow activation of ind, and is necessary for maintenance of Ind in truncal segments. These results indicate that input from the anteroposterior patterning system is needed for the spatially restricted expression of DV genes in the brain and ventral nerve cord...|$|E
40|$|The {{homeotic}} or Hox genes encode {{a network}} of conserved transcription factors which provide axial positional information and control segment morphology in development and evolution. During embryonic brain development of Drosophila, the Hox gene labial (lab) is essential for tritocerebral neuromere specification; lab loss of function results in tritocerebral cells that fail to adopt a neuronal identity, causing axonal pathfinding defects. Here we present evidence that the POU-homeodomain DNA-binding protein ventral veins lacking (vvl) acts genetically downstream of lab in the specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. In the embryonic brain, vvl expression is seen in all brain neuromeres, including the tritocerebral lab domain. Lab mutant analysis shows that vvl expression in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> is dependent on lab activity. Loss-of-function analysis focussed on the <b>tritocerebrum</b> reveals that inactivation of vvl results in patterning defects which are comparable to the brain phenotype caused by null mutation of lab. In the absence of vvl, mutant tritocerebral cells are generated and positioned correctly, but these cells fail to express neuronal markers indicating defects in neuronal differentiation. Moreover, longitudinal axon pathways in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> are severely reduced or absent and the tritocerebral commissure is missing in the vvl mutant brain. Genetic rescue experiments show that vvl is able to partially replace lab in the specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. Our results indicate that vvl acts downstream of the Hox gene lab and regulates specific aspects of neuronal differentiation within the tritocerebral neuromere during embryonic brain development of Drosophila.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{morphogenetic}} reorganization that occurs in the grasshopper brain during embryogenesis. We find that morphogenetic movements occur at three organizational levels during brain development. First, the entire developing brain changes its orientation {{with respect to the}} segmental chain of ventral ganglia. A 90 degrees shift in the attitude of the brain neuraxis occurs during embryogenesis due to a gradual upward movement of the cerebral structures in the head. Second, the clusters of proliferating neuroblasts and progeny that generate the neuroarchitecture of the mature brain move relative to one another and to nonneural structures such as the stomodeum. This is especially pronounced for the pars intercerebralis and for the <b>tritocerebrum,</b> as shown by annulin and engrailed immunoreactivity. Third, individual neuroblasts within a given proliferative cluster undergo positional reorganization during embryogenesis. Identified neuroblasts of the <b>tritocerebrum</b> and the pars intercerebralis are displaced within the brain.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{composition}} of the arthropod head {{is one of the}} most contentious issues in animal evolution. In particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain. Onychophora (velvet worms) play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the Early Cambrian. However, the segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain - key issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda - remain unclear. Results Using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain, we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. The region of the central nervous system corresponding to the arthropod <b>tritocerebrum</b> is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral nerve cords. Conclusions Our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora and instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite (two-segmented) brain composition. They suggest that the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the <b>tritocerebrum</b> evolved in arthropods. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{embryonic}} {{development of}} the Drosophila brain, the Hox gene labial {{is required for the}} regionalized specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of Hox gene action in the CNS, we have studied the molecular and genetic basis of cross-regulatory interactions between labial and other more posterior Hox genes using the GAL 4 /UAS system for targeted misexpression. Misexpression of posterior Hox genes in the embryonic neuroectoderm results in a labial loss-of function phenotype and a corresponding lack of Labial protein expression in the <b>tritocerebrum.</b> This is due to repression of labial gene transcription in the embryonic brain. Enhancer analysis suggests that this transcriptional repression operates on a 3. 65 kb brain-specific labial-enhancer element. A functional analysis of Antennapedia and Ultrabithorax protein domains shows that the transcriptional repression of labial requires homeodomain-DNA interactions but is not dependent on a functional hexapeptide. The repressive activity of a Hox protein on labial expression in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> can, however, be abolished by concomitant misexpression of a Hox protein and the cofactors Homothorax and nuclear-targeted Extradenticle. Taken together, these results provide novel and detailed insight into the cross-regulatory interactions of Hox genes in embryonic brain development and suggest that specification of tritocerebral neuronal identity requires equilibrated levels of a Hox protein and Hth and n-Exd cofactors...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{neuroblast}} lineages {{which give}} rise to the adult-specific interneurons of two Drosophila brain regions, the <b>tritocerebrum</b> and the subesophageal ganglion, were described, and {{an analysis of the}} expression and function of the developmental control genes of the Hox family in these regions was performed. In the first study (chapter 2), the Hox gene and tritocerebral maker labial was used together with clonal genetic labeling to identify the 4 postembryonic neuroblast lineages of the <b>tritocerebrum.</b> Subsequently, clonal mutation was used to show that expression of labial is required for timely-precise apoptosis of 2 neuroblasts, which otherwise {{give rise to}} outgrowing ectopic lineages in the <b>tritocerebrum.</b> In the second study (Chapter 3), the postembryonic subesophageal ganglion was investigated. First, markers for cell adhesion molecules and synapses were used to characterize the neuronanatomical structures of the subesophageal ganglion in respect to thoracic neuromeres. In this analysis, a small number of secondary axon tracts were found. Second, genetic labeling was used to identify the clonal basis for this reduction and a number of only 14 subesophageal neuroblast lineages were identified in the late larval subesophageal ganglion. Third, the subesophageal neuroblasts were traced through development, and a severe reduction in neuroblast number was found in this region to take place between middle embryonic and late larval stages. Fourth, the Hox genes Deformed, Sex combs reduced and Antennapedia were shown to be expressed in discrete domains in the subesophageal ganglion, and most of the subesophageal lineages in the late larva were found to be positive for one of these Hox proteins. Fifth, clonal genetic knockout was used to show that the Dfd, Scr and Antp genes are required for three lineage-specific functions in the subesophageal ganglion: proper axonal targeting of 2 lineages, correct cell number in 2 lineages and termination of 5 neuroblasts via programmed cell death. In chapter 4, the expression and function of Hox genes in the Drosophila nervous system was reviewed in the context of genetic interactions and evolutionary conservation. In summary, postembryonic generation of adult-specific neurons in the tritocerebral and subesophageal brain regions of Drosophila was shown to be mediated by a small number of neuroblast lineages and to involve three lineage-specific functions of Hox proteins. ...|$|E
40|$|The subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the Drosophila brain {{processes}} mechanosensory and gustatory {{sensory input}} from sensilla {{located on the}} head, mouth cavity and trunk. Motor output from the SEZ directly controls the movements involved in feeding behavior. In an accompanying paper (Hartenstein et al., 2017), we analyzed the systems of fiber tracts and secondary lineages to establish reliable criteria for defining boundaries between the four neuromeres of the SEZ, as well as discrete longitudinal neuropil domains within each SEZ neuromere. Here we use this anatomical framework to systematically map the sensory projections entering the SEZ throughout development. Our findings show continuity between larval and adult sensory neuropils. Gustatory axons from internal and external taste sensilla of the larva and adult form two closely related sensory projections, (a) the anterior central sensory center located deep in the ventromedial neuropil of the <b>tritocerebrum</b> and mandibular neuromere, and (b) the anterior ventral sensory center (AVSC), occupying a superficial layer within the ventromedial <b>tritocerebrum.</b> Additional, presumed mechanosensory terminal axons entering via the labial nerve define the ventromedial sensory center (VMSC) in the maxilla and labium. Mechanosensory afferents of the massive array of chordotonal organs (Johnston's organ) of the adult antenna project into the centrolateral neuropil column of the anterior SEZ, creating the antenno- mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC).

40|$|Locustamyoinhibiting peptide (Lom-MIP) {{is one of}} the 4 {{identified}} myoinhibiting neuropeptides, {{isolated from}} brain-corpora cardiaca-corpora allata-suboesophageal ganglion complexes of the locust, Locusta migratoria. An antiserum was raised against Lom-MIP for use in immunohistochemistry. Locustamyoinhibiting peptide-like immunoreactivity (Lom-MIP-LI) was visualized in the nervous system and peripheral organs of Locusta migratoria by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. A total of 12 specific immunoreactive neurons was found in the brain. Processes of these neurons innervate the protocerebral bridge the central body complex and distinct neuropil areas in the proto- and <b>tritocerebrum</b> but not in the deuterocerebrum nor in the optic lobes. The glandular cells of the corpora cardiaca, known to produce adipokinetic hormones, are contacted by Lom-MIP-LI fibers. The corpora allata were innervated by the nervus corporis allati I containing immunoreactive fibers. Lom-MIP-LI cell bodies were also found in the subesophageal ganglion, the metathoracic ganglion and the abdominal ganglia I-IV. In peripheral muscles, Lom-MIP-LI fibers innervate the heart, the oviduct, and the hindgut. In the salivary glands, Lom-MIP-LI was detected in the intracellular ductule of the parietal cells. Possible functions of Lom-MIP are discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstracts By using {{immunocytochemistry}} {{method of}} Strept Avidin-Biotin-Complex, four kinds of antisera raised against rabbits {{were applied to}} observe the immunoreactive neurons and neuropils of sero-tonin (5 -HT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP) and β-Endorphin (β-Ep) in optic ganglia and brain of Metapenaeus ensis. The results showed that, the 5 -HT-immunoreactive cells were located in all the four neuropils of optic ganglia. Immunoreactivity of 5 -HT was detected in anterior medial protocerebrum neuropils (AMPN), and {{the inner and outer}} lateral beside olfactory lobe (OL) of deutocerebrum. The presence of NPY-immunoreactive cells was found in all the four neuropils of the optic ganglia. NPY-immunoreactivity occurred in the anterior median cell cluster, lateral cell cluster of protocerebrum, and cell cluster beside OL and AMPN. SP-immunoreactivity was found in medulla terminalis (MT) of optic ganglia, and lateral cell cluster of protocerebrum and posterior lateral cell cluster of <b>tritocerebrum.</b> β-Ep-immunoreactive cells were in MT only. In conclusion, these specific distribution patterns of the four immunoreactive substances can be used as morphological clues for understanding their different neuro-physiological functions.

40|$|In {{the female}} turnip moth, Agrotis segetum, a {{pheromone}} biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) stimulates sex pheromone biosynthesis which exhibits a daily rhythm. Here we show data supporting a circadian rhythm in PBAN {{release from the}} corpora cardiaca, which we propose regulates the endogenous rhythm in sex pheromone biosynthesis. This conclusion is drawn as the observed daily rhythm in PBAN-like immunoreactivity, in the hemolymph is persistent in constant darkness and is phase-shifted by an advanced light:dark cycle. PBAN-like immunoreactivity {{was found in the}} brain, the optic lobe, the suboesophageal ganglion and in the retrocerebral complex. In each hemisphere ca. 10 immunopositive neurons were observed in the pars intercerebralis and a pair of stained somata in the dorso-lateral protocerebrum. A cluster of cells containing PBAN-like immunoreactive material was found in the <b>tritocerebrum</b> and three clusters of such cells were found in the SOG. Their processes reach the corpora cardiaca via nervi corporis cardiaci and the dorsal surface of the corpora allata via the nervi corporis allati. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the role of the}} {{wingless}} gene in embryonic brain development of Drosophila. wingless is expressed in a large domain in the anlage of the protocerebrum and also transiently in smaller domains in the anlagen of the deutocerebrum and <b>tritocerebrum.</b> Elimination of the wingless gene in null mutants has dramatic effects on the developing protocerebrum; although initially generated, approximately one half of the protocerebrum is deleted in wingless null mutants by apoptotic cell death at late embryonic stages. Using temperature sensitive mutants, a rescue of the mutant phenotype can be achieved by stage-specific expression of functional wingless protein during embryonic stages 9 - 10. This time period correlates with that of neuroblast specification but preceeds the generation and subsequent loss of protocerebral neurons. Ectopic wingless over-expression in gain-of-function mutants results in dramatically oversized CNS. We conclude that wingless is required {{for the development of the}} anterior protocerebral brain region in Drosophila. We propose that an important role of wingless in this part of the developing brain is the determination of neural cell fate...|$|E
