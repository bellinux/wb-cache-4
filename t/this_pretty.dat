What remains of the monastery is a large gothic church which beautifully dominates the town centre in Graiguenamanagh.

In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: [...] "We created an identity for her. She was <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too... religious?... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great". Kaif called Shroff's comments [...] "hurtful".|$|E
500|$|During pre-production, {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that several actresses including Genelia D'Souza, Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor were {{being considered for}} the role of Kaali Gawde. However, Chopra was approached over the others, who agreed to do the film instantly. While initial reports suggested that Chopra would be playing the role of a sex worker in the film, they were later denied as rumours. In an interview with Rediff.com, she clarified that she was playing a prostitute's daughter. On Chopra's character, Malhotra commented, [...] "Despite being a male dominated film, the part played by Priyanka is very prominent. It isn't that of a simple or ordinary lover. She is there for Vijay unconditionally and without any expectations. With all the dangerous people around her, she is like <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> flower standing there with a smile on her face." [...] In preparation for her role, Chopra wanted to visit a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E

500|$|Mitford had no {{training}} as a writer or journalist; her style, particularly in the pre-war novels, is chatty and informal, much as in her letters. She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles, who in his youth during the Franco-Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as [...] "extremely graphic and amusing". Mitford's fiction, based on upper-class family life and , belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners. Her protagonists—typically, intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing—are broadly autobiographical. [...] It is unsurprising, says Thompson, that Mitford should first attempt {{to write a novel}} in the early 1930s, since many of her friends were doing the same thing. What is surprising, Thompson adds, is the ease with which [...] she found a publisher for this first book. Perhaps, says Thompson, her [...] publishers Thornton Butterworth [...] "liked the idea of <b>this</b> <b>pretty,</b> well-connected girl who wrote in the style du jour". Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels; Rachel Cooke, writing on their reissue in 2011, believes she had no reason to be: [...] "There is a special kind of energy here, and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer who would rather die than be boring".|$|E
500|$|By April 1853 the {{situation}} had become very acrimonuous. [...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte). [...] This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages. [...] The Association Medical Journal was quickly followed by the Medical Times and with growing pressure on The Lancet to do the same <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> much ended professional medical support for the device, {{at least for the time}} being.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{well known}} and less {{developed}} is the northeastern lower peninsula along the Lake Huron shore. It offers many great vacation spots, particularly along the coast. These are, in order from south-to-north, Standish, Omer, Au Gres, Tawas City, East Tawas, Oscoda, Greenbush, Harrisville, Alpena, Presque Isle, Rogers City, Cheboygan, and points in between. Some consider these to be more 'up north' than the relatively congested west coast. Indeed, the Detroit Free Press noted that the area between Oscoda and Ossineke included beaches that are [...] "overlooked" [...] and among the [...] "top ten in Michigan." [...] This would include the area around Harrisville (and two state parks). It was noted that: [...] "Old-fashioned lake vacations abound on <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> stretch of Lake Huron." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1980s, [...] "Dr. Ruth", {{became a}} {{household}} name and she made guest appearances on several network television shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman. She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of Hollywood Squares that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s, Westheimer appeared as herself in episode 89 of Quantum Leap, the episode title being [...] "Dr. Ruth". She appeared on Tom Chapin's album <b>This</b> <b>Pretty</b> Planet, in the song [...] "Two Kinds of Seagulls", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually. [...] "It takes two to tingle", says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 Honda Prelude ad, and an ad for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo and body wash.|$|E
2500|$|On Bannicle or Bannack Hill {{there was}} an Admiralty {{telegraph}} station which was built in 1822 {{as part of a}} semaphore line between the Admiralty in London and Portsmouth. It was about 30 yards east of Hill House, but no trace of the station remains. William Cobbett in Rural Rides referred to the station when travelling through the hills of Hambledon. [...] "On one of these hills is one of those precious jobs, called semaphores. For what reason <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> name is given to a sort of Telegraph house, stuck up at public expense upon a high hill; for what reason this outlandish name is given to the thing, I must leave the reader to guess; but as to the thing itself; I know that it means this; a pretence for giving a good sum of public away every year..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Things {{would improve}} slowly. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and {{sketches}} grew in popularity ("If They Mated", [...] "Desk Drive", [...] "In the Year 2000"). A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of news figure. The lips and voice of these characters – frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of Bill Clinton – were supplied by writing partner Robert Smigel. A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. [...] "It was a morale boost," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "I'm thinking, If {{the guy who}} created the 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go." [...] The show went through a temporary wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer. The show's quality improved slowly over time, and most credit O'Brien's growing comedic performance. Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with a more elegant, narrative-driven remotes. Regular characters would typically include a [...] "Masturbating Bear" [...] and a famous remote found Conan visit a historic, Civil War-era baseball league. That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, [...] "When I leave this earth, at the funeral, just show this, because <b>this</b> <b>pretty</b> much says who I'm all about." ...|$|E
