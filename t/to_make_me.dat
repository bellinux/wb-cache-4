40|$|This past February, I {{was able}} to produce and direct a {{production}} of José Rivera’s References <b>to</b> Salvador Dalí <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> Hot. References <b>to</b> Salvador Dalí <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> Hot {{tells the story of}} a woman living between realms of waking and sleeping through a Dalí-esque lens. Salvador Dalí was a painter associated with the surrealist movement. I wanted to explore the relationship of the play and Salvador Dalí with Freud’s theory of the uncanny. The uncanny discusses what is both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. It uses mirrors, doubles, repetition, eyes, and souls as models of what is uncanny. In reading References <b>to</b> Salvador Dalí <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> Hot, I found that using the uncanny as my concept would be a perfect match to the script. In this paper, I will explore why Freud’s The ‘Uncanny,’ Salvador Dalí, and References <b>to</b> Salvador Dalí <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> Hot are compatible as well as my process of directing and producing a show...|$|R

Once his car returned to parc fermé, it failed post-race scrutineering, and was found to have a modified front wing, leading to his disqualification.

Nelson Piquet, Jr. recovered from his [...] "dismal" [...] qualifying performance to finish an eventual fourth, taking the championship lead. While e.dams Renault retained their lead in the teams' championship, the strong result for the Dragon Racing squad meant they moved up into second.

[...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> look younger was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures."
