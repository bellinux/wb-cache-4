40|$|A central {{statement}} {{of the theory of}} natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is that preferential trading with regional <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is less likely to be trade diverting and therefore geographically proximate partners are to be considered "natural" partners for preferential arrangements. This paper examines this question empirically. The analytical framework involves a general equilibrium model of preferential trade and an econometric model with tight links to this theory. This framework is used to implement tests of the natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> hypothesis using U. S. trade data for the years 196495 : Welfare changes that would result from preferential tariff reductions by the United States against various <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> are first estimated, and correlations with bilateral "distance" measures (with and without controls for income levels) are then examined. Since the argument for "natural" <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant <b>trading</b> <b>partners,</b> correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well. Both geographic proximity and trade volume are found to have no effect. Thus this paper is unable to find any support for the natural <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> theory in U. S. data. ...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E

While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> Narva were left without suitable protection.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of trade {{diversity}} and <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> on domestic economic growth for 69 countries during the period 1970 ~ 2000.

In addition, the variables, such as growth rate of investment, rate of inflation, and openness are included in regression analysis. The results show that trade affects economic growth; the economic growth rates are high in countries with high openness, the more commodity variety of exports and imports, the more variety of <b>trading</b> <b>partners,</b> and the high economic growth of <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> This paper suggests policy implications {{that we have to}} diversify trading commodities and <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> as well as increase trade volume in order to maximize the positive effects of trade on economic growth...|$|R

5|$|At {{least as}} far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major <b>trading</b> <b>partner</b> of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major <b>trading</b> <b>partner,</b> {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E
5|$|During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily {{influenced}} Madagascar's economic planning and policy {{and served as}} its key <b>trading</b> <b>partner.</b> Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was {{a key factor in}} launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British <b>trading</b> <b>partner.</b> He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire.

In our model, banks normally collect information about their <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> which assures them of the soundness of these relationships. However, when acute financial distress emerges in parts of the financial network, {{it is not enough to}} be informed about these partners, as it also becomes important to learn about the health of their <b>trading</b> <b>partners.</b> As conditions continue to deteriorate, banks must learn about the health of the <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> of the <b>trading</b> <b>partners</b> of the <b>trading</b> <b>partners,</b> and so on.
