25|$|TrueDoc, {{while not}} {{specifically}} a webfont specification, {{was the first}} standard for embedding fonts. It {{was developed by the}} type foundry Bitstream in 1994, and became natively supported in Netscape Navigator 4, in 1996. Due <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b> license restrictions, with Netscape unable to release Bitstream's source code, native support for the technology ended when Netscape Navigator 6 was released. An ActiveX plugin was available to add support for TrueDoc to Internet Explorer, but the technology had to compete against Microsoft's Embedded OpenType fonts, which had natively supported in their Internet Explorer browser since version 4.0. Another impediment was the lack of open-source or free tool to create webfonts in TrueDoc format, whereas Microsoft made available a free Web Embedding Fonts Tool to create webfonts in their format.|$|E
500|$|Though Wohlwend {{describes}} {{his interest in}} [...] "simple and elegant" [...] game design as permeating his works, Hundreds minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming. The code was [...] "" [...] and written in a single file. It was the first game he programmed, though he had some assistance with the in-game physics. Wohlwend wanted the game to be purchased by a Flash game site like Kongregate or Newgrounds. When the sites were not interested, he chose <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b> his code, partly {{with the intent to}} spur [...] "non-coders" [...] to try coding, as he had.

500|$|Upon {{finishing}} {{his role as}} artist on Solipskier, Wohlwend wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game. He developed Hundreds from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling, where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing. He found {{this to be a}} good core game concept and based the game around [...] "patience and persistence". The game's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school, where Wohlwend composed in black, white, and red so as to focus on composition rather than color. While Wohlwend's design style is [...] "simple and elegant", the game's minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming. The code was [...] "" [...] and written in a single file. He finished Hundreds as a Flash game in 2010, but when Flash sites were not interested in purchasing it, Wohlwend chose <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b> the code (partly with the intent to spur [...] "non-coders" [...] to try coding, as he had). This version is available online at Newgrounds.|$|E

2500|$|Jewish users, too, {{have embraced}} this {{do-it-yourself}} and open source ethos. In coming together <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b> a project, users not only produce an evolving and meaningful Jewish artifact, they also construct a Jewish community that often extends both temporally and physically {{beyond the scope}} of the original project. Riffing on [...] Raymond, Jewish users are definitely creatures of the bazaar as they revisit, reconsider and, in some cases, rework many of the seminal texts in Jewish life: the Siddur, the Tanakh, the d’var torah (sermon), the Haggadah, and The Book of Legends. These [...] "open source projects" [...] not only invited involvement by users at their individual level of learning and desire for engagement, but created connections and forged bonds between individuals across time zones and denominations.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{after the}} release of the {{wireless}} products called Intel Pro/Wireless 2100, 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005, Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate. As a result of this, Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community. Linspire-Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source,</b> as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft. Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being [...] "an Open Source fraud" [...] after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open-source conference. In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received {{as a result of the}} wireless dealings, the binary firmware [...] still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles.|$|E

2500|$|Open {{source in}} {{healthcare}} — Created in June 2009 by the nonprofit eHealthNigeria, the {{open source software}} OpenMRS is used to document health care in Nigeria. The use of this software began in Kaduna, Nigeria to serve the purpose of public health. OpenMRS manages features such as alerting health care workers when patients show warning signs for conditions and records births and deaths daily, among other features. The success of this software is caused by its ease of use for those first being introduced to the technology, compared to more complex proprietary healthcare software available in first world countries. This software is community-developed {{and can be used}} freely by anyone, characteristic of open source applications. So far, OpenMRS is being used in Rwanda, Mozambique, Haiti, India, China, and the Philippines. The impact of open source in healthcare is also observed by Apelon Inc, the [...] "leading provider of terminology and data interoperability solutions". Recently, its Distributed Terminology System (Open DTS) began supporting the open source MySQL database system. This essentially allows for open source software to be used in healthcare, lessening the dependence on expensive proprietary healthcare software. Due <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>source</b> software, the healthcare industry has available a free open source solution to implement healthcare standards. Not only does open source benefit healthcare economically, but the lesser dependence on proprietary software allows for easier integration of various systems, regardless of the developer.|$|E
