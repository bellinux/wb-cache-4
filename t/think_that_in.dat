5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E
5|$|Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson {{believe the}} {{inscription}} {{of the famous}} Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against {{the division of the}} realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.|$|E

25|$|According to Rabbi David Kimchi (1160–1235), in his {{commentary}} on Obadiah 1:20, Ṣarfat and Sepharad, both, {{refer to the}} Jewish captivity (Heb. galut) expelled during the war with Titus and who {{went as far as}} the countries Alemania (Germany), Escalona, France and Spain. The names Ṣarfat and Sepharad are explicitly mentioned by him as being France and Spain, respectively. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the case of the place-name, Ṣarfat (lit. Ṣarfend) – which, as noted, was applied to the Jewish Diaspora in France, the association with France was made only exegetically because of its similarity in spelling with the name פרנצא (France), by a reversal of its letters.|$|E
25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{no country}} in the civilized world is less {{attention}} paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless {{it is easy to}} perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans... most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.|$|E

500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gilligan also {{extensively}} coached and lectured {{around the}} county, {{spending time in}} the English winters raising the team's profile. He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, {{and most of the}} club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that Gilligan {{was one of the most}} popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight". Swanton wrote that [...] "Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the world of sport he ever made an enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than {{a foot and a half}} square?" ...|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.
