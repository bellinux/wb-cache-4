40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents the}} mission analysis studies performed for the phase A {{of the solar}} electric propulsion option of the European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO) mission. ESMO {{is scheduled to be}} launched in 2011, as an auxiliary payload on board of Ariane 5. Hence the launch date will be imposed by the primary payload. A method to efficiently assess wide launch windows for the Earth-Moon transfer is presented here. Sets of spirals starting from the GTO were propagated forward with a continuous <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> until reaching an apogee of 280, 000 km. Concurrently, sets of potential Moon spirals were propagated backwards from the lunar orbit injection. The method consists of ranking all the admissible lunar spiral-down orbits that arrive to the target orbit with a simple <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> profile after a capture through the L 1 Lagrange point. The 'best' lunar spiral is selected for each Earth spiral. Finally, comparing the value of the ranking function for each launch date, the favourable and unfavourable launch windows are identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{continuous}} <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> on the orbital motion and mass {{loss of a}} vehicle initially in a circular orbit is investigated analytically. It is shown that, for a thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 0. 16175, escape speed will eventually be reached along an unwinding spiral trajectory. For lower thrust-to-weight ratios, escape speed is never attained, and the flight path oscillates around a logarithmic spiral trajectory. Formulas are obtained for the approximate orbital motion and time of flight along each type of trajectory and for mass loss due to expenditure of rocket propellant...|$|E

The relative increases are 100 % and 127 % for the <b>tangential</b> and <b>thrust</b> forces, respectively, as the depth of cut increases from 10 to 20  Å. Meanwhile, the maximum equivalent stress value also increases with the depth of cut, but the magnitude of change is much less significant compared with cutting forces.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the first prototypes of robotic end-effectors showing manipulation capabilities, much research focused on the design and control of robot hand and grippers. While many studies focus on enhancing the sensing capabilities and motion agility, a less explored topic is the engineering of the surfaces that enable the hand to contact the object. In this paper we present the prototype of the Velvet Fingers smart gripper, a novel concept of end-effector combining the simple mechanics and control of under-actuated devices together with high manipulation possibilities, usually offered only by dexterous robotic hands. This enhancement is obtained thanks to active surfaces, i. e. engineered contact surfaces able to emulate different levels of friction and to apply <b>tangential</b> <b>thrusts</b> to the contacted object. Through the paper particular attention is dedicated to the mechanical implementation, sense drive and control electronics of the device; some analysis on the control algorithms are reported. Finally, the capabilities of the prototype are showed through preliminary grasps and manipulation experiment...|$|R
40|$|Future space {{missions}} {{to the outer}} planets may depend upon the use of low-thrust propulsion systems. As these planets are decidedly oblate, {{the question of the}} effect of that oblateness on a low-thrust trajectory is of some interest. In this paper the problem of optimal energy increase is attacked under the assumption that the coefficients for the second zonal harmonic, and the nondimensional thrust acceleration are the same order of magnitude. By means of a two-variable asymptotic expansion technique, a near optimal control program is generated and the first-order uniformly valid approximation for the corresponding trajectory is obtained. <b>Tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> is shown to be a good near-optimal thrust program even in the presence of oblateness effects. The optimal control program is found to be oscillatory and quite similar to the optimal control for energy increase in an inverse square gravitational field...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic study for analytical determination of thrust acceleration magnitude {{on a given}} trajectory for {{a case where the}} thrust is tangential or perpendicular to the flight direction. The problem has been formulated using the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. In the numerical application for <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> the transfer from low Earth orbit to planar Lyapunov orbits around L 1 and L 2 Lagrangian points by a semi-elliptic transfer path is considered. For the case in which the thrust is perpendicular to the flight direction also on a semi-elliptic trajectory, the results are compared to the ones of Miele and Mancuso (2001), and Sandro da Silva Fernandes (2010) in their studies based on a simplified version of the same restricted three-body problem of transferring a spacecraft from a circular low Earth orbit to a circular low Moon orbit...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the limits}} of the classical, two-body, inverse-square-gravity model, {{explicit}} guidance solutions are presented for power-limited transfers of a spacecraft between two coplanar circular orbits, performed under the Keplerian class of continuous-thrust programs. The Keplerian class is parameterized by an arbitrary, differentiable, explicit function of time, named the throttling function, and leads to a special type of analytically soluble two-dimensional orbital motion. The primary characteristics of such motion are the resulting qualitative and computational simplicity, exact guidance, conditional power-limited near-optimality, and unlimited two-dimensional maneuverability. It is shown that, for a given transfer duration, the Quadratic subclass of the Keplerian class, for which the throttling function is a quadratic polynomial, can be used to obtain open- and closed-loop solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions exactly, but at the expense of sacrificing some optimality. If, in addition, the transfer duration is sufficiently high, then the Tangential subclass, corresponding to a constant throttling function and <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust,</b> can be used to obtain open- and closed-loop guidance solutions that are identical, very simple to compute in real time, and practically as cheap as the corresponding minimum-fuel solutions...|$|E
30|$|Tool {{rake angle}} has a {{significant}} effect on machining performances in nano-scale polycrystalline machining. As the tool rake angle changes from - 30 ° to + 30 °, the <b>tangential</b> and <b>thrust</b> forces decrease by 47 % and 1, 660 %, respectively. The thrust force is much more sensitive to the change of rake angle. The use of nonnegative rake angles reduces the stress concentration in the formed chips.|$|R
40|$|It {{comprises}} two fingers, each {{of which}} has two phalanges and a planar manipulator structure with two rotary joints. Furthermore, each phalanx is equipped with one Sensitive Active Surface (SAS). The Velvet Fingers [1] is a dexterous under-actuated gripper for unstructured industrial environments. It offers enhanced manipulability by means of Active Surfaces (AS) on its fingers, i: e:; surfaces able to emulate different levels of friction and to apply <b>tangential</b> <b>thrusts</b> to the contacted object. The usefulness of the AS (implemented by controlled conveyor belts) is discussed in [2]. Although their benefits are substantial, their main limitations are the lack of force feedback and missing information of the contact point loca-tion, as well as limitations on the fictitious friction range. In this article we discuss the employment of an intrinsic force/torque (F/T) sensor mounted between the frame of the phalanx and the AS which are henceforth referred to as Sensitive Active Surfaces (SAS). For this purpose the experimental device shown and described in Fig. 2 has been set up at the University of Pisa. Furthermore, we implemented and tested an algorithm for the determination of contact point locations, as well as a variable friction control algorithm. The geometrical portion of the belt involved in a pos-sible contact with a grasped object is formed by a plane corresponding to the outer conveyor belt surface and two semicircles associated with the belt rollers (see indicators (3) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{grasping}} and manipulation systems {{is one of}} the most investigated topics in recent robotic and automation engineering. It is a process that has to take into account many development possibilities and to face different trade offs, as that between application possibilities and design complexity. In this work we present the design of a novel end-effector that merges the essential mechanics and control simplicity of underactuated devices, together with the high levels of manipulability usually featured in dexterous robotic hands. To obtain this enhancement, the proposed gripper considers the possibility offered by active surfaces, i. e. engineered contact surfaces able to simulate different levels of friction and to apply <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> to the contacted object. The actual dexterity enhancement is evaluated by an analytical manipulability analysis and some examples of in hand manipulations and grasps are taken into account. A mechanical solution is presented, which implements the proposed idea through the adoption of one DoF active surfaces mounted on the fingers. The proposed solution presents a manipulability index one order of magnitude higher than common grippers...|$|E
40|$|Shape-based {{approaches}} are practical for finding sub-optimal solutions during the preliminary design of low-thrust trajectories. Logarithmic spirals are the simplest, but of little practical interest due {{to having a}} constant flight-path angle. We prove that the same <b>tangential</b> <b>thrust</b> profile that generates a logarithmic spiral yields an entire family of generalized spirals. The system admits two integrals of motion, which are equivalent to the energy and the angular momentum equations. Three different subfamilies of spiral trajectories are obtained depending on {{the sign of the}} constant of the generalized energy: elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Parabolic spirals are equivalent to logarithmic spirals. Elliptic spirals are bounded; never escape to infinity and the trajectory is symmetric. Two types of hyperbolic spirals have been found: the first has only one asymptote; the second has two asymptotes, the trajectory is symmetric and never falls to the origin. The solution is obtained when solving rigorously the equations of motion with no prior assumptions. Closed-form expressions for both the trajectory and the time of flight are provided...|$|E
40|$|The Electric Solar Wind Sail (E-sail) is an innovative, propellantless space {{propulsion}} concept {{based on}} the interaction {{of a number of}} electrically biased tethers with the protons of the solar wind. The spacecraft and the tethers are kept at a high positive potential with respect to surrounding plasma by means of an electron gun in order to enhance the electrically effective sail area and generate a net thrust on the spacecraft. This paper deals with the preliminary design of a small and flexible E-sail test mission, considering the constraints imposed by small and medium class launchers for primary and piggyback payloads. In particular, the Ariane 5 ASAP (Ariane Structure for micro-Auxiliary Payloads) is assumed as a reference, considering a standard Kourou Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) as the spacecraft release orbit. The target orbit for this technology demonstration mission is a highly elliptical orbit with the same perigee altitude of the initial orbit (600 km) and an apogee altitude of at least 25 Earth radii (~ 165800 km), so as to operate the payload, composed by the tethers, the high voltage system and the required diagnostics, out of the Earth’s magnetosphere. This target orbit guarantees a sufficient level of electrostatic interaction between the charged tethers and the solar wind, so that thrust can be measured by on-board accelerometers. Considering the relevant total impulse typical of such transfer maneuvers, an electric propulsion system, based on a low power Hall Effect Thruster, is envisaged to provide the spacecraft the required velocity increment with a small propellant mass fraction. The spacecraft is meant to be equipped with four triple junction GaAs/Ge solar arrays and the energy produced by solar panels is stored in a space proven Li-Ion battery pack. The mission design has been carried out considering a set of pericenter-centered <b>tangential</b> <b>thrusting</b> arcs, to raise the orbital apogee, and a final phase of continuous thrusting along orbit semi-minor axis, to increase the orbital eccentricity. Third body perturbations, Earth oblateness and eclipse phases (during which the thruster is supposed to be switched off to limit the battery pack mass) are accounted for. This approach results in a transfer maneuver requiring about 12 % of propellant mass fraction with a total required velocity increment of 1. 62 km/s. The total transfer time is of about 130 days with approximately 1000 hours of cumulative thruster firing time. The spacecraft total mass is estimated sizing each of its main subsystem and results to be of the order of 65 kg. For all the subsystems Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components have been preferred so as to reduce costs and increase system reliability...|$|R
50|$|The moving steam imparts both a <b>tangential</b> and axial <b>thrust</b> on {{the turbine}} shaft, but the axial thrust {{in a simple}} turbine is unopposed. To {{maintain}} the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. Thrust bearings {{can be used for}} the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be double flow- the steam enters {{in the middle of the}} shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a double flow rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called two-flow, double-axial-flow, or double-exhaust. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.|$|R
2500|$|Since these criticisms are {{concerned}} {{not with the}} validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are <b>tangential</b> to the <b>thrust</b> of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, [...] "I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?" [...] Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: [...] "God looks only at what is inward." [...] For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} showing {{the need and}} {{motivation}} for an examination of automotive design education.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} low-thrust Laser Powered Interorbital Vehicle (LPIV) intended for cargo transportation between an Earth space station and a lunar base is presented. The selected mission utilizes a spiral trajectory, characteristic of a low-thrust spacecraft, requiring eight days for a lunar rendezvous and an additional nine days for return. The ship's configuration consists primarily of an optical train, two hydrogen plasma engines, a 37. 1 m box-beam truss, a payload module, and propellant tanks. The total mass of the vehicle, fully loaded, is 63, 300 kg. A single plasma, regeneratively cooled engine design is incorporated into the two 500 N engines. These {{are connected to the}} spacecraft by turntables that allow the vehicle to <b>thrust</b> <b>tangential</b> to the flight path. Proper collection and transmission of the laser beam to the thrust chambers is provided through the optical train. This system consists of a 23 -m-diameter primary mirror, a convex parabolic secondary mirror, a beam splitter, and two concave parabolic tertiary mirrors. The payload bay is capable of carrying 18, 000 kg of cargo and is located opposite the primary mirror on the main truss. Fuel tanks carrying a maximum of 35, 000 kg of liquid hydrogen are fastened to tracks that allow the tanks to be moved perpendicular to the main truss. This capability is required to prevent the center of mass from moving out of the thrust vector line. The laser beam is located and tracked by means of an acquisition, pointing, and tracking system that can be locked onto the space-based laser station. Correct orientation of the spacecraft with the laser beam is maintained by control moment gyros and reaction control rockets. In addition, an aerobrake configuration was designed to provide the option of using the atmospheric drag in place of propulsion for a return trajectory...|$|R
