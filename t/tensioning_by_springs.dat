50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are <b>tensioned</b> <b>by</b> a <b>spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised {{pressure}} plate on the top surface of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The flocking material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small {{pressure plate}} (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the pressure plate has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under <b>tension</b> <b>by</b> a coiled <b>spring</b> beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|Mattel {{produced}} an automatic firing cap weapon styled after the Thompson submachine gun. Pulling {{back on a}} slide, which simulated the charging handle of the real Thompson, prepared the gun for firing <b>by</b> <b>tensioning</b> a <b>spring.</b> When the trigger was pulled the spring power would drive the mechanism, firing a series of up to ten caps from a sprocket-fed roll. It was made initially for a Dick Tracy line of toys, then camouflaged for a Green Beret Guerilla Fighter line of weapons, then restyled again as a tie-in with the Planet of the Apes franchise.|$|R
50|$|The Kandahar design offered two {{advantages}} over the earlier designs. The {{use of a}} spring to provide tension allowed fine control over the mechanics, and a smooth action that did not suddenly increase tension {{at the end of}} the stroke. It also allowed the skier to adjust the <b>tension</b> <b>by</b> moving the <b>spring</b> or turning a control knob, allowing for different conditions and skiing style and stride. More important was the addition of two small hooks on either side of the ski near the heel. When skiing downhill, the skier could clip the cable under the hooks, locking down the heel and providing much greater control. Now the ski could be turned by rotating the leg, forcing the ski to stem. When it was time to climb back up the hill, the cable was unhooked and returned to being a normal cross-country binding.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'Diana' labeled cameras, there are over fifty similar variants of the basic design, {{some of which may}} have been produced by other factories and/or manufacturers. The camera was sold under a variety of model names, often accomplished by merely affixing a different stick-on label to the same product. [...] In other cases, slight modifications to the basic design were incorporated. Some Diana clones use a slightly different molding and plastic composition, while other models have a 'bulb' setting for time exposures. Other variants incorporate a 6×6 cm negative size (like the Diana Deluxe), while others have provision for different controls or even separate flash illumination. The 3 aperture version of the classic Diana/Diana clone has apertures of , , and , and it takes 32 mm clip-on filters. The Diana Deluxe variant offers , , and , and takes a 46-49 mm step-up ring, unusual for such a low-end camera. The modern Diana F+ offers four apertures, including a pinhole. Shutter speed is often variable due to manufacturing vagaries, and can vary from 1/200th to 1/30th of a second. [...] As there is no shutter lock, and the shutter mechanism is always held in <b>tension</b> <b>by</b> a <b>spring,</b> multiple exposures with the Diana can be achieved by multiple operations of the shutter release without advancing the film.|$|R
25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal <b>tensioned</b> <b>by</b> a blade <b>spring.</b> Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|R

40|$|This thesis elaborates on {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of an artificial mechanical upper limb prototype for transradial amputations, i. e. {{for patients with}} stump between elbow and wrist joints. The artificial limb is designed {{for use in a}} wide spectrum of patients. Therefore, the main components are designed to be applicable to smaller as well as larger hand dimensions. The artificial mechanical limb is designed to be controlled by the other hand of a patient and enables grasping of objects via cylindrical and hook grip. Fingers are driven <b>by</b> <b>tension</b> <b>springs</b> and can be locked in extension. Clenching can be initiated by pressing a button, which unlocks the fingers, thus an object can be grasped. Wrist joint is adjustable when pressed a release button. Forearm joint is locked <b>by</b> preloaded <b>spring.</b> The lock of the forearm joint is released by sufficient torque. New position of the forearm joint is locked automatically when the torque is not being applied. Prototypes of the artificial mechanical upper limb were manufactured by using of rapid prototyping technologies (FDM, SLM) as well as CNC milling machine. All parts of the artificial limb were designed with regard to manufacturability by conventional methods such as casting, injection and the like. The artificial limb prototype had been designed on 3 D data basis of a specific patient, who already has tested the prototype. Following materials were used on the prototype: ABS plastic, SikaBlock M 940 polyurethane, aluminium and 316 L stainless steel...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the advancements {{of the application}} of thermal tensioning techniques to different weld geometries in order to eliminate buckling distortion. The main goal of this work is to better understand these techniques through experimental and numerical investigation and increase their technological maturity to aid industrial implementation. The thermal tensioning techniques investigated in this work are Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling and Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating. The investigation for both techniques encompasses thermal source characterisation, application to different weld geometries and residual stress measurements and analysis of both butt and fillet welded samples. A detailed technology transfer study of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling {{was carried out in}} which different aspects of the application of TTC to arc welding (Gas Metal Arc Welding and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) was examined. This study focused on the influence of both the liquid CO 2 delivery system installation and welding tooling and jigging on the effectiveness of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. Experimental and numerical cooling source characterisation was also carried out in the Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling work to investigate the characteristics of the cooling source under different cooling conditions. The Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling work was then concluded with welding trials and residual stress measurement and analysis. The results of the Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling study show that the installation of the liquid CO 2 delivery system as well as the welding tooling and jigging has a major influence on the effectiveness of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. The cooling source characterisation work reveals that the most important parameter of the cryogenic nozzle delivery system used in this work is the Air Entrainment Gap. A description of a control system of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling is suggested based on controlling the Air Entrainment Gap. The residual stress analysis shows a reduction in the Applied Weld Load and minor changes in the tensile peak of the residual stress distribution of both butt and fillet welded panels. The Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating investigation includes heat source characterisation, application of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating on butt and fillet welds, utilisation of alternative heat sources and residual stress analysis. The results of these investigation show that Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating is also highly effective in eliminating buckling distortion in butt, fillet and overlapped panels. The applied heating temperature in this work is typically in the range of 160 - 250 °C but not greater than 330 °C. The residual stress measurements reveal that the additional heating of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating generates a positive stress gradient at the location of heating...|$|R

5000|$|A {{general strike}} {{was called by}} the people of Bahrain in March 1956 to remove Belgrave as advisor and force him to leave the country. During the strike, which was {{estimated}} to have included 30,000 people, 9,000 of them oil workers, at least 11 people were reported killed in riots on 11 March, after an argument broke out at a vegetable market. [...] The riots started at the Bahrain's oil refinery. A few days before the riots broke out the car of Selwyn Lloyd, the British foreign secretary, was attacked with rocks, with the attackers shouting [...] "Down with Belgrave!" [...] British nationals were forced to stay indoors for safety. As a result, Belgrave's powers were reduced significantly, although Shaikh Salman refused to remove him totally. Shaikh Salman also allowed the establishment of the first legal political party, the National Union Committee (NUC; aka [...] "Committee for National Unity"), a step toward democratic elections. The total killed was later reduced to 5. [...] Some American officials said that this was another example of the British trying to hold on to their colonialism. [...] The uprising {{is said to have been}} started through the effort of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the ruler of Egypt at the time, going as far as secretly funding merchants of the bazaar, because of the disagreement that he was having with the British, and other western powers, over Israel. [...] The Soviet Union would take advantage over the <b>tensions</b> caused <b>by</b> this <b>spring</b> upheaval and the criticisms of the western powers (Britain, France and the United States), to supply arms to the Nasser government.|$|R

30|$|In 1998, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ILC Dover, Inc. {{developed}} a 1 m diameter X-band planar membrane reflect array antenna [41], {{as shown in}} Figure  7 (a). The two-layer membrane was polyimide film with both sides clad with 0.5 µm thick copper. The frame was a circular inflatable tube, which was connected to a tripod supporting the antenna feed. In 2000, the two companies co-{{developed a}} 3 m Ka-band membrane reflect array antenna [42], as shown in Figure  7 (b). The horseshoe shaped frame consisted of one straight rigid tube, two straight tubes, and one semi-circular inflatable tube. The membrane could be rolled on the rigid tube to avoid creases. There were 16 catenary points distributed on the horseshoe shaped frame to apply stress on the membrane, and the surface flatness {{was measured to be}} ±  0.2 mm. In 2002, JPL proposed the idea of a “movie screen” membrane array antenna with a rectangular frame [44, 45], as shown in Figure  7 (c). The antenna feed was offset on the spacecraft, which eliminated the need for a feed-supporting tripod, resulting in a more compact structure. Two edges of the rectangular frame were inflatable tubes, and the other two edges were flat panels covered by roll-up shells, on which the membrane could be tightly rolled. Several cross bars, distributed uniformly on the membrane and employed as compression members to stretch the membrane, had no connection with the inflatable tubes. One constant force spring hung on each end of the cross bar and was connected to cables at the membrane edge. Similarly, some constant force springs hung on the flat panel and were connected to the cable. The membrane was deployed by the tubes inflating and was <b>tensioned</b> <b>by</b> constant force <b>springs</b> after deployment. From 2004 to 2008, JPL conducted a series of studies on “movie screen” antennas [46 – 48]. In 2008, a 2.2 m ×  2.2 m planar membrane antenna was developed and achieved a surface flatness of 0.17 mm.|$|R
