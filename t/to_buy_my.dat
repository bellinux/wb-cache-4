500|$|Politicians {{generally}} reacted along party lines, with Senator Mundt stating, [...] "Nixon's {{speech is}} complete vindication {{against one of}} the most vicious smears in American history." [...] Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, [...] "I wish he had talked about the 18,000 bucks—not the puppy dog... Suppose someone sets up a fund <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> meals. I could say I didn't get one red cent of the money." ...|$|E

If I don't show up to court, it'll be a judgement against me & will probably show up on my credit report. Oh well. I try <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> shit cash anyway. They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm paying homage." ...|$|E
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> <b>My</b> guess is {{she knows how to}} unravel an old tired sweater to knit herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal was to find a green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E

60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Not necessarily. Remember the Armorer's Faith. I {{will take}} {{an order from}} a good man as cheerfully as from a bad one. If you good people prefer preaching and shirking <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>my</b> weapons and {{fighting}} the rascals, don't blame me. I can make cannons: I cannot make courage and conviction. Bah! You tire me, Euripides, with your morality mongering. Ask Barbara: SHE understands. [He suddenly takes Barbara's hands, and looks powerfully into her eyes]. Tell him, my love, what power really means.|$|R
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me what you want me <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> <b>my</b> accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Presley had {{to defend}} himself from claims of being a racist: he was alleged to have said: [...] "The only thing Negro people can do for me is <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> records and shine my shoes." [...] The singer always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African-Americans, {{subsequently}} investigated the story and found no basis to the claim. However, the Jet journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people [...] "regardless of race, color or creed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{began to}} develop an {{interest}} in acting {{to the point where}} his grades worsened and began to play hookey from school. He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there 'til someone came along, and then ask them <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, Ben. Just the same, {{why should}} he give me such a hard look? Of course, I haven't been in his place of {{business}} for a good while. But he can't expect me <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> all <b>my</b> furnishing goods from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} set my eyes in that direction, nor do I {{think the thing}} I have set myself to do will ever be in <b>my</b> power--that is, <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> back <b>my</b> father's estate; but so long as I live I shall keep that in view." ...|$|R
60|$|Steel {{said nothing}} further, and I {{was in no}} mood for conversation. Gaspard's Trail was to be sold on the morrow, and Lane had {{carefully}} chosen his time. The commercial depression was keener than ever, and there is seldom any speculation in Western lands at that time of the year. It was evidently his purpose <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> in <b>my</b> possessions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't ask you <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> <b>my</b> dear sir. Isaac {{just show}} this young gentleman {{some of those}} {{beautiful}} all-wool suits for nine and ten dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If mother's willin', I'd {{like to have}} you, an' I don't believe she'll care. Now, I've got <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> stuff. Where'll I {{meet you}} afterward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get {{a little}} bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won't cost much, so I'll have some left <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> pencils," [...] added Amy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to my church, all ye {{that want}} to go <b>to</b> Heaven, and <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> penny weekly guide, and pay my pew-rates; and, pray ye, {{have nothing to do}} with my misguided brother over the road. This is the only safe way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I am undone! All {{my money}} is stolen! Not a farthing left <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> masses for <b>my</b> poor soul! And no absolution, no viaticum, nor anything! I die {{like a dog}} and am damned!" ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. Oh well, {{if youre}} in earnest about helping her, I'll {{tell you what}} you might do. You might get your {{patients}} <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> some of <b>my</b> things, or to give me a few portrait commissions.|$|R

60|$|Limb. Hang it, {{it is no}} matter; I will be satisfied: If {{it comes}} to a rupture, I know the way <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> peace. Pug, produce the key.|$|E

6000|$|... "There ain't money {{enough in}} this country <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> out <b>my</b> paint," [...] said Lapham, {{buttoning}} up his coat in a quiver of resentment. [...] "Good afternoon, sir." [...] Men are but grown-up boys after all. Bellingham watched this perversely proud and obstinate child fling petulantly out of his door, and felt a sympathy for him which was as truly kind as it was helpless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{even as a}} loan," [...] {{said the}} old woman. [...] "Besides, young man, you must not fancy that I am {{altogether}} penniless. I 'appen to 'ave shares in an American Railway, which my landlord advised me <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> with <b>my</b> small savings.

6000|$|Great heavens, how I winced! I {{knew what}} his words meant. They were the very words I had said myself to Colonel Clay, as the Count von Lebenstein, about the purchase-money of the schloss--and {{in the very}} same accent. I saw through it all now.

6000|$|... "Ten {{thousand}}!" [...] ejaculated Naab. [...] "Holderness, I wouldn't take {{a hundred}} thousand. You {{might as well}} ask <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>my</b> home, my stock, my range, twenty years of toil, for ten thousand dollars!" ...|$|E
