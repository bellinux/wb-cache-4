When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none." ...|$|E

According to Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence at that time, he stated that the unit's establishment was needed because Singapore is not [...] "dealing only with people with guns. They may be dealing {{with people who have}} very powerful explosives and various kinds of other substances, chemical, radiological and so on, so you need to develop capabilities to deal with these <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to deal with them at sea, at shore, buildings, aeroplanes, ships, coastlines and so on, so you do need to bring together these capabilities, develop them in a much more complete, coherent and integrated way."

2500|$|On September 5, 1989, {{after her}} Sizzling Spectacular concert in Nevada, Gordon {{forcibly}} married Jackson, claiming {{it was for}} her own protection against kidnapping by her family. La Toya Jackson states that this was both unplanned and against her wishes. According to Jackson; [...] "I told him, 'No way, Jack! I can't marry you. You know what marriage means to me. I've never been in love; I don't even date.... It's not right. I don't love you. I don't have feelings for you.'" [...] Jackson tried {{to run out of}} the chapel three times but bodyguard Antonio Rossi grabbed her saying, [...] "There's some <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do. Even if you don't want to." [...] Jackson told Ebony magazine the marriage was [...] "strictly in name only. It has never been consummated." [...] Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed her head against the corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, , which accused her father of physical abuse.|$|E
2500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders became successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] The reason for this {{was that they had}} to provide them with the goods that the Anglo-American traders had previously supplied, and at similar prices. This proved to be singularly difficult. [...] With the exception of one or two Montreal merchant traders, the Canadians showed a great reluctance to venture into the Ohio country. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief also known as the [...] "Half King", became anti-French as a consequence.

2500|$|Iorga's {{tolerance}} {{for the national}} bias in historiography and his own political profile were complemented {{in the field of}} literature and the arts by his strong belief in didacticism. Art's mission was, in his view, to educate and empower the Romanian peasant. The rejection of art for art's sake, whose indifference in front of nationality issues enraged the historian, was notably illustrated by his 1902 letter to the like-minded Luceafărul editors, which stated: [...] "You gentlemen should not allow aesthetic preoccupations to play the decisive part, and you are not granted such circumstances as to dedicate yourselves to pure art.... Do not imitate..., do not allow yourselves to be tempted by <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read elsewhere. Write about things from your country and about the Romanian soul therein." [...] His ambition was to contribute an alternative to Junimist literary history, and, according to comparatist John Neubauer, for the first time integrate [...] "the various Romanian texts and writers into a grand narrative of an organic and spontaneous growth of native creativity, based on local tradition and folklore." [...] Iorga described painter Nicolae Grigorescu as the purveyor of national pride, and was enthusiastic about Stoica D., the war artist. He recommended artists to study handicrafts, even though, an adversary of the pastiche, he strongly objected to Brâncovenesc revival style taken up by his generation. His own monographs on Romanian art and folklore, admired in their time by art historian Gheorghe Oprescu, were later rated by ethologist Romulus Vulcănescu a sample of microhistory, rather than a groundbreaking new research.|$|E
