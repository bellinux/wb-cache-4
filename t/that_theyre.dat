It isnt a fact that we're inferior to them: it's a put-up job; and it's they that have put the job up. It's we that run the country for them; and all the thanks we get is to be told we're Philistines and vulgar tradesmen and sordid city men and so forth, and <b>that</b> <b>theyre</b> all angels of light and leading. The time has come to assert ourselves and put a stop to their stuck-up nonsense. Perhaps if we had nothing better to do than talking or writing, we could do it better than they. Anyhow, theyre the failures and refuse of business (hardly a man of them that didnt begin in an office) and we're the successes of it. Thank God I havnt failed yet at anything; and I dont believe I should fail at literature if it would pay me to turn my hand to it.|$|E

going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were

LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom

oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up

Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of

hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will

Explaining his characters motives, OMaonlai said, [...] "Tom likes Sharon ever such a lot. I dont think he expected to have so many feelings for her, but he does. He obviously enjoys the chase, wooing her with flowers ... I think he is genuine about her. Hes not playing games, even though he does have his secret. After they sleep together, he realises that theres real feeling there. Theyre keen on each other and I think Tom is probably a little nervous about his feelings for her ... He used to like her at school so is in shock <b>that</b> now <b>theyre</b> grown up, she likes him back—a lot, it seems. Even so, Tom is not the sort of guy who likes to look too far into the future. Hes too busy just having a really good time with Sharon to think about any long-term commitment. They go out together, have a lot of fun and are becoming great friends as well, which is always good. Tom is a little concerned that Phil has been prying into his affairs, and he is nervous that his secret might come out, but he is concentrating on Sharon. And, although Tom is a bit scared of Phil, I think hes not afraid to stand up to him, if needed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the variety of content on the album. NME said, [...] "Theres a {{creeping}} notion that every musical idea thats ever been so much as thought up is on this album." [...] In addition, Random Access Memories is ranked #497 on NMEs list, [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork echoed this sentiment, calling the record [...] "a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast {{and even a few}} pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that [...] "though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more human, the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect." [...] Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. DJ Magazine {{commented on the}} shift in Daft Punks musical style: [...] "While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, its that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, <b>thats</b> what <b>theyre</b> best at making." [...] Resident Advisor stated that [...] "its an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: 70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the albums key guest artists, popularized with Chic." [...] In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record [...] "taps into the wonder and excitement" [...] of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, [...] "Random Access Memories is also Daft Punks most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it." ...|$|R

Ann Hulbert of Slate remarked on Chuas [...] "shocking honesty about tactics.

5000|$|Release the Panic {{got three}} three-and-a-half-stars-out-of-five from AllMusic, {{both of the}} Jesus Freak Hideout reviews and The Phantom Tollbooth. First, AllMusics Steve Leggett {{illustrated}} how the [...] "Mixing a post-grunge sound, complete with a slight metal edge, and a radio-ready studio sheen, Red play songs <b>that,</b> although <b>theyre</b> often filled with confusion, despair, and anger, are also ultimately positive and redemptive". In addition, Leggett alluded to how the album [...] "doesnt mess with the formula very much, and if they sound like Linkin Park, say, or Chevelle, that firm faith in hope and redemption gives the band a kind of spiritual warmth not always apparent at first listen." [...] Jesus Freak Hideouts Bert Gangl called the album a [...] "bi-polar approach", but did proclaim that [...] "Release the Panic nevertheless earns its creators high marks for their willingness to shake up the established order a bit. More importantly, though, its stronger entries offer convincing hints that the groups next release may well {{turn out to be}} its defining work." [...] Kevin Hoskins delivered the second opinion for the publication, and noted how [...] "Theres nothing new here as the Release the Panic keeps pace with exactly what Red has been known for, and while that music is good, it again fails {{to live up to the}} aforementioned hype." [...] Moreover, Hoskins portends that [...] "Release the Panic will probably be known as one of the better rock albums of 2013, but likely will not land a spot on many greatest albums lists." [...] Also Gangl wrote an entirely different review for The Phantom Tollbooth, and found that [...] "Dyed-in-the-wool metal heads will probably view Panic’s ballads with the same contempt they heaped upon the better part of the Faces record. And, truth be told, the softer offerings on Panic, thanks to their sometimes overly generic character, sail wide of the mark as often as they hit it. In the same way, even on the most infectiously catchy tunes, the bands lyrics are often similarly undistinguished. Taken in the context of the release as a whole, though, the duff balladry is kept to a pleasantly bare minimum. And the groove-intensive nature of the mostly impressive heavier fare easily offsets the better portion of its word-related shortfalls." [...] Cross Rhythms Tony Cummings rated the album seven-stars-out-of-ten, and called found that the release [...] "contains some excellent cuts." ...|$|R

her that way for nothing I suppose {{there are a few}} men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin
