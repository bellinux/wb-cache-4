5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E

5|$|Some organisms use rolling as a {{means of}} locomotion. These {{examples}} do not constitute the use of a wheel, as <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of <b>the</b> <b>organism,</b> most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a sore throat. US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture, whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E
50|$|An {{ecosystem}} is {{a biological}} environment consisting of all <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> {{living in a}} particular area, {{as well as all}} the nonliving, physical components of the environment with which <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight. It is all <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> in a given area, along with the nonliving (abiotic) factors with which they interact; a biological community and its physical environment.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a captive}} yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} and two free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological symptoms {{were shown to}} be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.|$|E

5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous <b>the</b> <b>organism,</b> the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and {{the presence or absence}} of all the requirements that <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of evolution, {{as they are}} presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{phenocopy}} is {{a variation}} in phenotype (generally {{referring to a}} single trait) which is caused by environmental conditions (often, but not necessarily, during <b>the</b> <b>organism's</b> development), such that <b>the</b> <b>organism's</b> phenotype matches a phenotype which is determined by genetic factors. It is not a type of mutation, as it is non-hereditary.|$|R
40|$|Aggregative {{growth of}} non-slime-forming strains of Zoogloea ramigera was induced by growing <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> at a {{depressed}} pH. Calcium and magnesium ion {{was found to}} reverse aggregative growth of <b>the</b> <b>organisms.</b> Conversely, aggregation was stimulated when the available inorganic cation concentration of the growth medium was lowered {{by the use of}} a chelating agent. The aggregative effects of pH depression or cation depletion and the dispersal effects of cation supplementation were observed only during cellular growth. The data suggest that aggregate formation of non-slime-forming strains of Z. ramigera {{may be related to the}} calcium or magnesium metabolism of <b>the</b> <b>organisms,</b> or both...|$|R
5|$|The rate of {{cementation}} of the overlying substrate {{relative to}} the rate of decomposition of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the overlying sediment was cemented, whereupon ash or sand slumped in to fill the void, leaving a cast of the organism's underside.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, {{but less than}} TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E
