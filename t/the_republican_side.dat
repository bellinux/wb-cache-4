Byrne, Sr., {{who had previously}} been councilman for the 10th district; Henry W. Sawyer, a civil rights lawyer; and Marshall L. Shepard, a clergyman who had served as Commissioner of Records. On <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> incumbent at-large councilman Louis Schwartz was re-elected. The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M. Foglietta, a young lawyer and son of former councilman Michael Foglietta. Also losing bids for the Republican at-large seats were real estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E

50|$|The slaves did not {{immediately}} join Sonthonax's side, however. White colonists continued to fight Sonthonax, with assistance from the British. They were joined {{by many of the}} free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery. It was not until word of France's ratification of emancipation arrived back in the colony that Toussaint Louverture and his corps of well-disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves came over to <b>the</b> French <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> in early May 1794.|$|R
50|$|Llamas {{was born}} in 1944 in Mexico City. There is little {{published}} about her parents. Her father, José Maria Llamas Olaran, was Basque, and hailed from the Rioja region in Spain.

25|$|South Armagh {{has a long}} Irish republican tradition.

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to recruit the major rebel leaders to <b>the</b> French <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> commissioners sent Macaya as an {{emissary}} to the two most powerful rebel slave commanders in the north, Biassou and Jean-Francois. At the time these two leaders were allied with French royalists and Spain. But instead of convincing these two leaders to join <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Macaya himself defected to the royalist side. He issued a statement declaring his loyalty to the kings of France, Spain, and Kongo, who he described as {{the descendants of the}} biblical magi. Macaya may have been raised as a Catholic or exposed to Catholicism in Kongo.|$|R

5000|$|During the Spanish Civil War in {{the late}} 1930s, Midgley was outspoken in {{his support for the}} beleaguered Spanish Republic and {{described}} Franco as a [...] "monstrosity" [...] and a [...] "killer of babies". In turn, Midgley became involved in a public controversy regarding The Irish News attitude to the Spanish Civil War. The newspaper supported Francisco Francos Nationalists, partly because of Spanish Republican anti-clericalism, while Midgley saw <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> as fighting a necessary war against fascism and for democracy.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> of the House {{voted to}} block a $150million loan {{guarantee}} for Cape Wind, acknowledging that the block was narrowly targeted. The block may not be effective, as an agreement may be reached before the block comes into place.

25|$|One of de Valera's finest hours was his {{regrouping}} of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> after {{defeat in}} the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service {{of those who had}} served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> Air Force was {{popularly known}} as [...] "La Gloriosa" [...] (The Glorious One). But, {{according}} to some historians, the command structure of the Spanish loyalist forces was marred by ineptitude and lack of decision-making throughout the Civil War. Starting from the crucial first weeks of the conflict in July 1936, the rebel side was able to undertake a massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco using mostly the slow Ju 52, without any Spanish Republican interference. This was the world's first long-range combat airlift and the military planes on <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> failed to check it.|$|R

25|$|The armies kept growing. The {{principal}} {{source of}} manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting somewhat more aggressively, {{and there was}} little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> the influx of new interbrigadistas did not cover losses suffered by these units on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938 both armies achieved numerical parity and equalled about 700,000 each.|$|E
25|$|The party {{came close}} to expressing support for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> of the Spanish Civil War – on grounds of {{supporting}} defence of democracy (some writers initially took Spain {{as an example of}} what could happen if the capitalists class tried to use force to overturn the result of a socialist electoral revolution). This led to a debate within the party and resulted in an official statement that fell short of supporting the pro-capitalist republican government, but offering general support to workers in their struggle for democracy.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-eight {{thousand}} {{people were killed}} in the Republican zone during the war, 17,000 of whom were killed in Madrid or Catalonia within a month of the coup. Whilst the Communists were forthright in their support of extrajudicial killings, much of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> was appalled by the murders. Azaña came close to resigning. He, alongside other members of Parliament and a great number of other local officials, attempted to prevent Nationalist supporters being lynched. Some of those in positions of power intervened personally to stop the killings.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>the</b> Irish <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> Irish Independence Party had disbanded {{following}} poor {{election results}} in 1985.

Three of the fifty nine councillors elected for Sinn Féin in 1985 joined this grouping. The Remembrance Day bombing of 1987 had a negative impact on subsequent SF support.

5000|$|From Paris, {{volunteers were}} {{transferred}} to the Spanish border for their surreptitious journey on foot across the Pyrenees. Having entered Spain, Fullarton was sent {{for a brief period}} of military training at Figueres, although this proved to be basic at best: fake wooden rifles were distributed for practice due to a shortage of the real thing. He was then assigned to the Major Attlee Company and in the early summer of 1938 moved to the Chabola Valley in preparation for <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> <b>side's</b> crossing of <b>the</b> River Ebro. Fullarton bonded with his fellow volunteers and attended lectures on political theory and ideology. [...] "People would quote Lenin and Stalin by the yard. I realised how ignorant I was about these things. I didn't know about them at that time." [...] When the Battle of the Ebro began in July 1938, Fullarton was at the centre of the action amidst relentless German aerial bombardment. [...] "Every day we got it - an average of six or seven times. Twenty or 30 of them would come over and give us all they had, then strafe us with the machine guns", he said.|$|R
