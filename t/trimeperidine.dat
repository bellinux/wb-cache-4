5000|$|<b>Trimeperidine</b> {{has four}} {{structural}} isomers, of which two are active, the γ isomer <b>trimeperidine,</b> and the β isomer isopromedol. It is around half {{the potency of}} morphine as an analgesic, and has been widely used {{for the treatment of}} pain. [...] <b>Trimeperidine</b> produces similar effects to other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Trimeperidine</b> (Promedol) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of prodine. It {{was developed in the}} early 1950s in the USSR during research into the related drug pethidine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trimeperidine</b> is in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9646 with {{an annual}} {{aggregate}} manufacturing quota of 2 grammes as of 2014. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.883 for the hydrochloride. [...] It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries {{in the same fashion}} as is morphine or heroin.|$|E
40|$|Background. Effective {{postoperative}} analgesia {{remains an}} essential problem in modern anesthesiology. The search of factors affecting the pain intensity {{after the surgery}} is of significant practical importance. It is known, that personal experience, psychological and social state {{may be related to}} the level of postoperative pain syndrome. At the same time, genetic factors regulating opioid pharmacodynamics contribute to the large interpatient variability in postoperative opioid requirements. Thus, OPRM 1 gene polymorphism 118 A>G is a primary candidate for genetic influence on the efficacy of opioids, as well as patients emotional reactions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interrelation between patients preoperative psychological condition, variations of the OPRM 1 gene and pain intensity after the surgery. Materials and Methods. The observational study has been conducted, which included 100 consecutive patients undergoing major urological surgeries with lumbotomic access. Postoperative pain management included intramascular administration of <b>trimeperidine</b> and NSAIDs on doctor's prescription. The level of preoperative anxiety and depression was assessed using the HADS scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Pain after the surgery was assessed within the first 24 hours after the surgery. SNP OPRM 1   118 A>G was analysed using real-time PCR. Differences in patient groups were considered statistically significant at p< 0. 05. Results. Clinical anxiety was revealed in 24...|$|E
