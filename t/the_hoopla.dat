500|$|Pre-Madonna {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that [...] "although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; {{you just feel}} that something is really missing." [...] Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "the demos on Pre-Madonna are a delight to listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying." [...] Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, [...] "a gloriously voyeuristic—and unauthorized—glimpse at Madonna's past, the woman she was then. You can actually sense {{the development of the}} icon she is today from the songs." [...] Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that [...] "it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as <b>the</b> <b>hoopla</b> surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different." [...] After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, [...] "but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots {{can be found on the}} collection of early demos Pre-Madonna." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{spotlight}} {{and attention}} given to American celebrity supercouples reached its height in 2006, when the celebrity phenomenon dubbed [...] "Brangelina" [...] triggered media obsession surrounding screen stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The two emerged as a prominent supercouple, and the mania that followed was described as having [...] "reached the point of insanity, far overshadowing <b>the</b> <b>hoopla</b> that attended such couples as 'Bennifer' and 'TomKat'". The obsessive media attention surrounding Pitt and Jolie's union was initially the result of rumors regarding Pitt's involvement with Jolie during the shooting of their 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Speculation that Pitt had been romantically involved with Jolie while still married to Jennifer Aniston was daily gossip and {{thought to be the}} reason for Pitt and Aniston's divorce. Jolie, however, stated that there was no romance between her and Pitt during filming and that she would never be intimate with a married man.|$|E
