5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> sciences. For {{five years in}} a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 {{million a year in}} research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E

25|$|Although work in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> was {{conducted}} {{out of the}} conviction that western medicine was good for Africans, {{it was not an}} entirely altruistic programme. The missionaries were to reflect the emerging Victorian view of Africa and African peoples, that African thought and behaviour needed radical change if they were to be converted to western values. Like missionary work in other parts of Africa, it was viewed as a key means to prove the power and mystery of the Christian message.|$|E
25|$|Although {{its early}} {{beginnings}} {{can be traced}} to the field of clinical psychology, four different divisions within health psychology and one related field, occupational health psychology (OHP), have developed over time. The four divisions include clinical health psychology, public health psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology. Professional organizations for <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> psychology include Division 38 of the American Psychological Association (APA), the Division of Health Psychology of the British Psychological Society (BPS), and the European Health Psychology Society. Advanced credentialing in the US as a clinical health psychologist is provided through the American Board of Professional Psychology.|$|E

It appoints the Director-General every five years, and votes {{on matters of}} policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are {{to carry out the}} decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.

25|$|Formerly, {{units of}} {{measurement}} were the curie (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 grams of Radium (Ra-226); the rad (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the gray; and the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced with the sievert. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively {{before the advent of}} nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> care, various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief, while a contributory medical service for 23 million panel patients was introduced. Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution, while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out, as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment. The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the wage level (1970) and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced. In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued. That same year, compulsory health insurance was extended to the self-employed. In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> care, some {{prescription}} {{charges were}} abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers’ {{rights in the}} health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers. From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired {{at the age of}} 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985. A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.|$|E

It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of behavioral health and the treatment-oriented field of behavioral medicine. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of behavior change, and psychotherapy.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> {{advocacy}} {{also has}} deeper {{roots in the}} voluntary organization sector of society, where the early health advocates were more typically advocating for a cause, not for an individual. [...] These health advocates preceded hospital-based patient advocates and {{are part of a}} long history of American involvement in social organizations. [...] They were activists in social movements and voluntary associations including civic organizations, women's associations and labor organizations, and in the early disease-specific non-profits like the American Cancer Society (founded as the American Society for the Control of Cancer in 1913) or the March of Dimes (founded as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in 1938). [...] In {{the early part of the}} 20th century these advocates came to their work through other professional routes, often as social workers, attorneys, public health nurses or doctors. [...] They were the Progressive era [...] "new women" [...] of Hull House and the Children's Bureau, the American Association for Labor Legislation leaders of the movement in 1919 for national health insurance, the nurses who worked with Lillian Wald to advocate for indigent health care through Visiting Nurse Services (1893), or with the Maternity Center Association (1918) to advocate for maternal and infant care for poor immigrants. [...] They obtained their professional education in other disciplines and then applied it to health.|$|E
