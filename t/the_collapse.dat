5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> which occurred shortly after midnight local time. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E

40|$|The {{selectivity}} filter of the KcsA K+ channel has two typical conformations-the conductive and <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> conformations, respectively. <b>The</b> {{transition from}} the conductive to <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> filter conformation can represent the process of inactivation that depends on many environmental factors. Water molecules permeating behind the filter can influence <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> filter stability. Here we perform the molecular dynamics simulations to study the stability of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> filter of <b>the</b> KcsA K+ channel under the different water patterns. We find that the water patterns are dynamic behind <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> filter and <b>the</b> filter stability increases with {{the increasing number of}} water molecules. In addition, the stability increases significantly when water molecules distribute uniformly behind the four monomeric filter chains, and the stability is compromised if water molecules only cluster behind one or two adjacent filter chains. The altered filter stabilities thus suggest that <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> filter can inactivate gradually under the dynamic water patterns. We also demonstrate how the different water patterns affect the filter recovery from <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> conformation...|$|R
30|$|After an earthquake, {{the walls}} and the regular {{geometric}} structure of collapsed buildings are damaged, and the most of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings is <b>the</b> ruins, so the dominant scattering mechanism collapsed buildings can be approximately regarded as the volume scattering from randomly oriented dipoles. Because most of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings are ruins, there is little POA shift for <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings, and <b>the</b> implementation of POA compensation cannot greatly change the power of scattering components of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings. However, because of the POA shift of oriented buildings, the employment of POA compensation can enhance the double-bounce scattering power and weaken the volume scattering power. That is, the implementation of POA compensation can greatly change the power of scattering components of the oriented buildings. Therefore, all of the amplitude values of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol of the oriented buildings are greater than those of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings. <b>The</b> difference of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol between <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings can be used to distinguish them. During the three parameters of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol, the difference of CRDbl–Vol between <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings is greatest, so CRDbl–Vol is used to discriminate <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings in this paper.|$|R

40|$|Recently, KFe_ 2 As_ 2 {{was shown}} to exhibit a {{structural}} phase transition from a tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal phase under applied pressure of about 15 GPa. Surprisingly, <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> tetragonal phase hosts a superconducting state with T_c ∼ 12 K, while the tetragonal phase is a T_c ≤ 3. 4 K superconductor. We show that the key difference between the previously known non-superconducting collapsed tetragonal phase in AFe_ 2 As_ 2 (A= Ba, Ca, Eu, Sr) and <b>the</b> superconducting <b>collapsed</b> tetragonal phase in KFe_ 2 As_ 2 is the qualitatively distinct electronic structure. While <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> phase in <b>the</b> former compounds features only electron pockets at the Brillouin zone boundary and no hole pockets {{are present in the}} Brillouin zone center, <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> phase in KFe_ 2 As_ 2 has almost nested electron and hole pockets. Within a random phase approximation spin fluctuation approach we calculate the superconducting order parameter in <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> tetragonal phase. We propose that a Lifshitz transition associated with <b>the</b> structural <b>collapse</b> changes <b>the</b> pairing symmetry from d-wave (tetragonal) to s_± (collapsed tetragonal).
