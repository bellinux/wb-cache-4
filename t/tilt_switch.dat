2500|$|... 28 May: a UDR soldier (Brian Brown) and his {{sniffer dog}} {{were killed and}} another soldier wounded in an IRA bomb attack in Newry Road, Kilkeel, County Down. The {{soldiers}} were searching for a bomb which the IRA had claimed they left in the area when the sniffer dog nudged an oil drum which contained a booby trapped mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> device.|$|E

50|$|A <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> {{can trigger}} a bomb. Mercury tilt {{switches}} {{can be found}} in some bomb and landmine fuzes, typically in the form of anti-handling devices, for example, a variant of the VS-50 mine.|$|E
5|$|As an {{electrically}} conductive liquid, {{it was used}} in mercury switches (including home mercury light switches installed prior to 1970), <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> used in old fire detectors, and <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> in some home thermostats.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method through which dynamic sensor nodes {{determine}} that they move together by communicating and correlating their movement information. We describe two possible solutions, one using inexpensive <b>tilt</b> <b>switches,</b> {{and another one}} using low-cost MEMS accelerometers. We implement a fast, incremental correlation algorithm, which can run on resource constrained devices. The tests with the implementation on real sensor nodes show that the method distinguishes between joint and separate movements. In addition, we analyse the scalability from four different perspectives: communication, energy, memory and execution speed. The solution using <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> proves to be simpler, cheaper and more energy efficient, while the accelerometer-based solution is more accurate and more robust to sensor alignment problems...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} is the mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch.</b> It {{is in one}} state (open or closed) when tilted one {{direction}} with respect to horizontal, and the other state when tilted the other direction. This is what older style thermostats used to turn a heater or air conditioner on or off.|$|E
50|$|This type of switch {{performs}} {{much better}} than the ball <b>tilt</b> <b>switch,</b> as the liquid metal connection is unaffected by dirt, debris and oxidation, it wets the contacts ensuring a very low resistance bounce-free connection, and movement and vibration do not produce a poor contact. These types can be used for precision works.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tilt</b> <b>switches</b> {{provide a}} {{rollover}} or tip over warning for applications like construction equipment and lift vehicles that operate in rugged terrain. There are several non-mercury types, but few are implemented due to sensitivity to {{shock and vibration}}, causing false tripping. However, devices resistant to shock and vibration do exist.|$|R
5000|$|TiltElectromechanical slot {{machines}} usually include an electromechanical [...] "tilt switch", which makes or breaks a circuit if {{the machine is}} tilted or otherwise tampered with, and so triggers an alarm. While modern machines no longer have <b>tilt</b> <b>switches,</b> any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a [...] "tilt".|$|R
50|$|Cadmium {{is found}} {{in many of the}} {{components}} above; examples include plastic pigmentation, nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries and CdS photocells (used in night lights). Mercury is used in lighting applications and automotive switches; examples include fluorescent lamps and mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> (these are rarely used nowadays). Hexavalent chromium is used for metal finishes to prevent corrosion. Polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl Ethers/Oxides are used primarily as flame retardants.|$|R
50|$|The VS-50AR is an {{electronically}} fuzed {{version of}} the mine which contains an integral mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch,</b> that operates as an anti-handling device. The VS-50AR has a dummy pressure plate on top and its external appearance {{is very similar to}} the VS-50, which has obvious implications for demining personnel. The VS-50AR contains a reduced explosive charge, but which is still sufficient to blow the victim's hands off.|$|E
50|$|Since {{mercury is}} a {{poisonous}} heavy metal, devices containing mercury switches {{must be treated}} as hazardous waste for disposal. Because it is now RoHS restricted, most modern applications have eliminated it. A metal ball and contact wires can directly replace it, but may require additional circuitry to eliminate switch bounce. Low-precision thermostats use a bimetal strip and a switch contact. Precision thermostats use a thermistor or silicon temperature sensor. Low-cost accelerometers replace the mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> in precision applications.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the SB-33 called the SB-33AR (AR {{standing}} for Anti-Rimozione, [...] "Counter-Removal") exists. It looks identical to the standard SB-33 mine. However, the SB-33AR has an integral anti-handling device specifically designed to injure deminers. The anti-handling device in an SB-33AR consists of a mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> and battery connected to the detonator. When an SB-33AR is moved a few degrees from the horizontal (i.e. when a deminer lifts it), it detonates, blowing the victim's hand off. Generally, {{a small number of}} SB-33AR landmines would be sown inside a minefield containing standard SB-33 mines in order to hinder and deter any attempt to conduct demining operations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an encapsulated {{sensor node}} that is devised {{to monitor and}} record motion patterns over long, quotidian periods of time with potential application in psychological studies. Its design fuses different sensing modalities to allow efficient capturing of tilt and acceleration stimuli, as well as embedded algorithms that abstract from the raw sensory data to indicative features. By combining <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> and accelerometers with customized processing techniques, {{it is argued that}} a power-efficient yet information-rich approach is reached for the observation and logging of human motion-based activity...|$|R
25|$|Slam Tilt: There {{are special}} <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> {{placed on the}} {{underside}} of the playfield, on the coin door, and (on electromechanical games) in the lower cabinet and upper cabinet, designed to prevent cheating. If a player lifts and drops, pounds, or kicks the machine and activates any slam tilt, the entire game ends immediately for all players and may go into a reset/reboot mode. These are also used on video games. A similar Incline Tilt prevents a player from lifting the front of the cabinet to tip the ball back up the playfield by ending his turn.|$|R
5000|$|DB Regio Südwest {{operates}} Eifel-Mosel-Express in {{the form}} of class 628 diesel multiple units in triple units at speeds of up to 120 km/h. On weekends some double units of class 612 DMUs (with the <b>tilting</b> technology <b>switched</b> off) are used.|$|R
50|$|The detectives {{eventually}} arrest Kaspers, but {{not before}} Birgit purchases large quantities of the raw materials {{needed to make a}} triacetone triperoxide bomb. A call soon comes in that she has taken hostages in the Continental Bankcorp building and is threatening to blow it up unless Kaspers is put on a plane to Cuba. Nichols takes Kaspers into the lobby and gets him to admit to Birgit that his love for his daughter is more important to him than the radical ideology he has been trying to put into place. As Birgit begins to realize this, though, an FBI sniper outside the building gets a clear shot and kills her, knocking her backwards into Nichols' arms so that the <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> around her neck does not set off the bomb. As the hostages are freed and Kaspers and the body are taken away, Nichols muses to Eames that relationships such as the one between Kaspers and Birgit - or between himself and his own father - are the reason he never had any children.|$|E
50|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the cockpit would be a sealed fireproof and blast-resistant capsule, inspired by the example of the Scott Crossfield incident in the X-15 rocket plane, consideration was then given to making the capsule ejectable. After studying examples from both aviation and 250 mph drag boat racing of ejectable or separable capsules, it was decided to pattern the capsule separation for RV1 largely after the drag boat model, in which the capsule separates only after a crash has already initiated. However, due to the much higher speeds and different motions expected in comparison to a drag boat if RV1 were to crash, it was decided to incorporate both a mechanism for actively ejecting the capsule and an aerodynamic decelerator. Banks of compressed air rams {{on each side of the}} capsule will serve as the ejection mechanism, with tilt switches mounted in the horizontal and vertical planes acting to initiate ejection without driver intervention. In the ejection sequence currently envisioned, if the RV1 pitches or rolls beyond preset limits, a <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> will open a solenoid valve that releases compressed nitrogen into the banks of rams. As the capsule is launched outward, the tension from a steel cable lanyard attached between the capsule and the chassis will pull a mechanism in the capsule that releases a ballute to decelerate and stabilize the capsule.|$|E
50|$|Throughout The Troubles, the Provisional IRA made {{extensive}} use of IEDs in their 1969-97 campaign. They used barrack buster mortars and remote controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury <b>tilt</b> <b>switch</b> or microswitches. These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer, which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., boobytrapped briefcase or car bomb) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is {{what happened in the}} Brighton hotel bomb attack of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} based on the free-falling Blue Danube, but the Blue Peacock weighed 7.2 long ton lb. There would be two firing units, the casting and the warhead. Its steel casing was so large {{that it had to be}} tested {{outdoors}} in a flooded gravel pit near Sevenoaks in Kent.Since the bomb would be unattended, anti-tamper devices were also used. The casing was pressurised, and pressure and <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> were added. There were three different ways that the bomb could be detonated: a wire located three miles away, an eight-day timer, or anti-tampering devices. Once armed, Blue Peacock would detonate 10 seconds after being moved, if the casing lost pressure or if it was filled with water.|$|R

40|$|Sensor nodes can {{autonomously}} form ad-hoc {{groups based}} on their common context. We propose a solution for grouping sensor nodes attached on the same vehicles on wheels. The nodes periodically receive the movement data from their neighbours and calculate the correlation coefficients over a time history. A high correlation coefficient implies that the nodes are moving together. We demonstrate the algorithm using two types of movement sensors: <b>tilt</b> <b>switches</b> and MEMS accelerometers. We place the nodes on two wirelessly controlled toy cars, and we observe in real-time the group membership via the LED colours of the nodes. In addition, a graphical user interface running on the base station shows the movement signals over a recent time history, the latest sampled data, the correlation between each two nodes and the group membership...|$|R
40|$|A {{telemetry}} {{system for}} studying decapod crustacean behaviour is described which uses low frequency, digitally encoded electromagnetic tags whose signals are detected with {{a grid of}} loop aerials on the seabed. Electromagnetic telemetry {{can be used to}} study short range movements of cryptic animals in topographically complex habitats that are not amenable to ultrasonic telemetry. Digital encoding allows many individuals to be monitored simultaneously and one or more behavioural, physiological or environmental variables to be telemetered. In the present system, tag signals convey identity and a measure of activity derived from an integral <b>tilt</b> <b>switch.</b> Translocational movements are indicated by detection of tags with different aerials. A central data logger located on the seabed decodes and records tag signals and environmental measurements. Design life of tags is > 1 year and the receiving system batteries are replaced by divers at intervals of up to 4 weeks. In field tests, crab (Cancer pagurus L.) and lobster (Homarus gammarus (L.)) activity was monitored at an artificial reef for 14 months. Examples of the type of information acquired are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the system and potential applications are discussed. Limitations of digital electromagnetic telemetry stem mainly from the short range of detection, the need for cables on the seabed and {{the size and shape of}} the transmitting tag...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} into a generic assistive platform, which can accommodate {{a variety of}} patients suffering {{from a wide range}} of motor disabilities is described. Methodologies were established, whereby the design could be made sufficiently flexible, such that it could be programmed to suit these people in terms of their needs and level of motor disability. This needed to be achieved without redesigning the system for each person. Suitable sensors were chosen to sense the residual motor function of the disabled individual, while being non-invasive and safe for use. These sensors included a dual-axis accelerometer (<b>tilt</b> <b>switch),</b> a 6 -key touch sensor and a SCATIR switch (blink/wink sensor). The placement of the sensors, for the purpose of this study, were restricted to sensing arm (dual-axis accelerometer) or finger movements (touch sensors), head and neck movements (accelerometer) and blink/wink and/or eye-brow movements (SCATIR switch). These input devices were used to control a variety of different output functions, as required by the user, while being non-invasive and safe for use. After ethics approval was obtained, volunteers with various motor disabilities were subsequently invited to test the system and thereafter requested to answer a series of questions regarding the performance and potential usefulness of the system. The input sensors were found to be comfortable and easy to use, while performing predictably and with very little to no fatigue experienced. The system performed as expected and accepted all of the input sensors attached to it, while repeating specific tasks multiple times. It was also established that the system was customisable in terms of providing a specific output for a specific and voluntary input. The system could be improved by further compacting and simplifying the design and operation, while using wireless sensors were necessary. It was thereafter concluded that the system, in general, was capable of satisfying the various users’ diverse requirements, thereby achieving the required objectives...|$|E
40|$|Telerehabilitation is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the provision of rehabilitation across the spectrum of acute, sub-acute and community settings at a distance, using telecommunications technology as the service delivery medium. 1 Telerehabilitation relates to the services delivered by a number of health disciplines including physiotherapy. It may involve the full spectrum of client care including the client interview, physical assessment and diagnosis, treatment, maintenance activities, consultation, education and training. Telerehabilitation utilises a broad range of technologies to facilitate physiotherapy treatment. These include technologies such as the videophone, hardware videoconferencing systems, personal computer based videoconferencing systems with dedicated software tools, sensor technologies and extensive, fully immersive virtual reality systems with and without client feedback. Image based technologies can be successfully used for the remote diagnosis and management of clients. Sensor based telerehabilitation utilises sensor technologies such as <b>tilt</b> <b>switches,</b> accelerometers and gyroscopes to sample and quantify movement through three-dimensional space. Virtual reality based telerehabilitation systems make use of configurable computer-generate...|$|R
40|$|In ecology, prey {{switching}} {{refers to}} a predator's adaptive change of habitat or diet in response to prey abundance. In this paper, we study piecewise-smooth models of predator-prey interactions with a linear trade-off in a predator's prey preference. We consider optimally foraging predators and derive {{a model for a}} 1 predator- 2 prey interaction with a <b>tilted</b> <b>switching</b> manifold between the two sides of discontinuous vector fields. We show that the 1 predator- 2 prey system undergoes a novel adding-sliding-like (center to two-part periodic orbit; "C 2 PO") bifurcation in which the prey ratio transitions from constant to time-dependent. Further away from the bifurcation point, the period of the oscillating prey ratio period doubles, suggesting a possible cascade to chaos. We compare our model predictions with data and demonstrate that we successfully capture the periodicity in the ratio between the predator's preferred and alternative prey types in data on freshwater plankton. Our study suggests that it is useful to investigate prey ratio as a possible indicator of how population dynamics can be influenced by ecosystem diversity...|$|R

The sound {{is produced by}} the bow made from horsetail hair which goes between the strings made from silk. The bow has to be <b>tilted</b> to <b>switch</b> from one string to another. Saw duang is light and played vertically on the lap. It creates a bright tone unlike the Saw u which produces a mellow sound. Another instrument {{which is similar to}} the Saw duang is the Chinese stringed instrument called Huqin.|$|R

The molecular <b>tilt</b> and <b>switching</b> time of mesogens are analyzed {{as a function of}} temperature and cross-linking density upon application of an electric field. We observe an unexpected maximum in the switching time of the liquid crystal mesogens at intermediate field strength. Analysis of the molecular tilt over multiple time regimes correlates the maximum response time with a transition to entangled polymer dynamics at a critical field strength.

40|$|This {{reference}} contains {{guidance for}} responding to a mercury spill, and how to recycle mercury bearing products. This document also contains specific recommendations for the following types of products: batteries, fluorescent lights, high intensity discharge lamps (HID) lamps, ballasts, thermostats, switches, float switches, sump pumps, silent light <b>switches,</b> washing machines, <b>tilt</b> <b>switches,</b> freezers, flow meters, manometers, barometers, vacuum gauges, flame sensors on gas appliances, rubber flooring containing mercury, and mercury accumulation in sanitary drains. This reference also contains a general checklist of products found to routinely contain mercury. Mercury is a dangerous element in the environment today. It can cause serious health problems such as neurological and kidney damage. Mercury is found in many products that end up in landfills and incinerators allowing the mercury to re-enter the environment and pollute drinking water and contaminate the food chain. The following information is a helpful guide to identify products that contain mercury switches and thermostats. This guide describes where mercury switches and thermostats are located and how to remove and dispose of these properly. Mercury bearing articles should not be thrown in the trash, and serious care should be taken when dealing with this element. Safe Disposal • Store mercury thermostats and switches in a suitable sturdy, sealed container. A five gallon plastic bucket with a lid may work...|$|R
40|$|Since {{sound was}} first {{recorded}} on a cylinder wrapped in tin foil by Edison in 1877, technology has steadily evolved to allow an ever increasing level of sonic mutability. Gradually, pre-recorded sounds (or 'inputs') which where once fixed could be increasingly manipulated {{both before and}} during playback. While early gramophones and tape players afforded the operator very few parameters to experiment within, the development of digital technology transformed sound into a fully plastic medium. As such, sound {{in the age of}} digital reproduction has achieved a level of playability more commonly associated with the performance of live music. The sound-operator is now able to react to events unfolding in a live environment and adjust both subtle and prominent aspects of the sound in many of the same ways a musician can. Through a series of theatrical productions and collaborations Challis & Dean have explored the sonic and dramatic possibilities created by the utilization of digital technology in a live performance context. Their current project is a multimedia adaptation of the novel and film Metropolis (Harbou & Lang, 1927). The aural accompaniment for this project will be performed live using a range of adapted and purpose built sonic triggers (such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, <b>tilt</b> <b>switches,</b> and proximity sensors). This paper will outline the processes and techniques adopted in this production and consider how this way of working has altered the interactional relationship between those that perform sound and those that receive it...|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{switches}} {{have one}} or more sets of electrical contacts in a sealed glass envelope that contains a small quantity of mercury. The envelope may also contain air, an inert gas, or a vacuum. Gravity constantly pulls the drop of mercury to the lowest point in the envelope. When the <b>switch</b> is <b>tilted</b> in the appropriate direction, the mercury touches a set of contacts, thus completing an electrical circuit. <b>Tilting</b> the <b>switch</b> {{in the opposite direction}} moves the mercury away from that set of contacts, breaking that circuit. The switch may contain multiple sets of contacts, closing different sets at different angles, allowing, for example, single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) operation.|$|R
