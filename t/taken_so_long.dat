5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E

Kubicek wrote that it was [...] "Blaine doing what Blaine does best: fun bubblegum pop", but Gonzalez was surprised {{that she did not}} love it and gave it a [...] "B", as she [...] "really missed the backing of Blaine's Warbler cohorts." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 9, 2015, it was {{announced}} through Twitter that {{a version of the}} game for Nintendo's Wii U console was planned for release on the eShop online store for late 2015, later specified as August 13. A demo was released as part of a promotion titled [...] "Nindies@home", wherein players were invited to try several upcoming Wii U games between June 15 and June 22. On July 28, however, GalaxyTrail confirmed that production of {{the final version of the}} game was taking longer than expected, suggesting that the game's actual release would be later. DiDuro announced the cause of the delay on August 18: the Wii U version had been set back by a [...] "console-freezing bug", which would postpone the Wii U release indefinitely until the issue was fixed. It was later explained that the bug had <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> to detect because it only occurred in retail versions of the console, which had prevented GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the system to address the problem, which could potentially cause damage to the Wii U hardware. The bug was eventually fixed, and the game was released on the eShop on October 1; customers who had tried the game's demo were rewarded with a 15-percent discount.|$|E

I was also paying tribute to the film, Funny Face with the legendary Audrey Hepburn [...] My biggest inspirations were the 60s, the 70s, Brigitte Bardot, Andy Warhol, Twiggy and Diana Ross. I've always been fascinated by the way contemporary art uses different elements and references to produce something unique." [...] Following Knowles' statement, De Keersmaeker wrote in a statement to The Performance Club that she was neither angry or honored about its usage, questioning why had it had <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> for her work to reach popular culture. She also noticed a coincidence in that they were both pregnant during the filming of both videos, and wished Knowles the same joy her daughter had brought her.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 November 2003, {{delivering}} judgment the {{day after}} hearing the appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed all of Hanson and Ettridge's convictions. Hanson, having spent 11 weeks in jail, was immediately released along with Ettridge. The court's unanimous decision was that the evidence did not support a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that {{the people on the}} list were not members of the Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and that Hanson and Ettridge knew this when the application to register the party was submitted. Accordingly, the convictions regarding registration were quashed. The convictions regarding funding, which depended on the same facts, were also quashed. This decision did not specifically follow the Sharples case, where the trial judge's finding of such fraud had not been overturned in the appeal by Hanson and Ettridge. That case was distinguished as a civil suit – in administrative law, as to the validity of the decision by Electoral Commissioner O'Shea to register the party – in which proof had been only on the balance of probabilities. Chief Justice Paul de Jersey, with whom the other two judges agreed overall, suggested that if Hanson, Ettridge and especially the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had used better lawyers from the start, the whole matter might not have <b>taken</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> up to the appeal hearing, or might even have been avoided altogether. The Court of Appeal president, Margaret McMurdo, rebuked many politicians, including John Howard and Bronwyn Bishop MHR. Their observations, she said, demonstrated at least [...] "a lack of understanding of the Rule of Law" [...] and [...] "an attempt to influence the judicial appellate process and to interfere with the independence of the judiciary for cynical political motives", although she praised other leading Coalition politicians for accepting the District Court's decision.|$|E
