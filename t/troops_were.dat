5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed.

As a consequence the rebel <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> always rested while the less numerous defending federal <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E

To eliminate supply problems, states' armies' field uniform and weapons were the same as the regular Indian Army, and the Indian Government appointed a staff of officers designated Military Advisers and Assistant Military Advisers to assist the independent states' rulers in the training and organisation of their forces. Imperial Service <b>Troops</b> <b>were</b> commanded by Indian officers.
