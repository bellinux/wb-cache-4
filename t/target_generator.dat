We prove under a precise version of this assumption that BPL ⊆ ⋂_(α> 0) DSPACE(log^(1 +α) n). We strengthen the theorem to an equivalence by considering two generalizations {{of the concept of}} a pseudorandom generator against logspace. A <b>targeted</b> pseudorandom <b>generator</b> against logspace takes as input a short uniform random seed and a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks random to that particular automaton. A simulation advice generator for logspace stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the requirement is that there is some logspace algorithm that, given a finite automaton and this advice string, simulates the automaton reading a long uniform random input. We prove that ⋂_(α> 0) prBPSPACE(log^(1 +α) n) = ⋂_(α> 0) prDSPACE(log^(1 +α) n) if and only if for every <b>targeted</b> pseudorandom <b>generator</b> against logspace, there is a simulation advice generator for logspace with similar parameters.

The main parts {{of the new system}} consist of the stimulation unit, an irradiation unit and the photon detector. The size of the main measuring box is approximately 300 × 300 × 300 mm. In particular, to keep the electric power as low as possible, a miniature X-ray (Oxford, Eclipse II reflection <b>target)</b> <b>generator</b> and a metal-packaged photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu photonics, H 7421 - 40) were adopted here. 16 blue LEDs were employed for the stimulation of quartz OSL.

In order to check the usefulness of the new system, red thermoluminescence (RTL) glow curves were measured to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) using a volcanic quartz sample. These re-sults show that the new system improves the S/N ratio in comparison with an existing handmade sys-tem. The estimated RTL equivalent (or paleo) dose using quartz extracted from an archaeological roof tile of Shin-Yakushiji temple by means of the SAR protocol was in good agreement with previous measurements. This proves that the new system is suitable for practical use for RTL-measurements either for dosimetry or for dating with a high S/N ratio...|$|E
