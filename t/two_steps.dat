5|$|In all organisms, <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E

This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in <b>two</b> <b>steps.</b> Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> {{to secure}} {{completion of the}} Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T.

On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia.

40|$|In the thesis, we {{consider}} prediction of a univariate response variable, {{especially when the}} explanatory variables are almost collinear. A <b>two</b> <b>step</b> approach has been proposed. The {{first step is to}} summarize the information in the explanatory variables via a bilinear model with a Krylov structured design matrix. The second step is the prediction step where a conditional predictor is applied. The <b>two</b> <b>step</b> approach gives us a new insight in partial least squares regression (PLS). Explicit maximum likelihood estimators of the variances and mean for the explanatory variables are derived. It is shown that the mean square error of the predictor in the <b>two</b> <b>step</b> model is always smaller than the one in PLS. Moreover, the <b>two</b> <b>step</b> model has been extended to handle grouped data.

With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by <b>two</b> <b>steps,</b> preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{an upgrade}} of the Drammen Line to {{accommodate}} more trains started in 1991.

Ahead of the section stage, consisting of the Bærum Tunnel which would allow trains to run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika, Lysaker Station received a full modernization. The upgrades consisted of demolishing the existing station and building a new station with two island platforms. Snøhetta won the architecture competition for the station. The upgrades allowed several advantages: seven minutes shorter travel time west of Oslo combined with better regularity, trains previously turning at Skøyen Station could instead turn at Lysaker and a near doubling {{of the number of}} trains running through the West Corridor, allowing eleven more trains per hour.|$|E

5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in <b>two</b> <b>steps,</b> oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

When Plekhanov sided with Martov, Lenin flew into a rage and resigned from both the Iskra editorial board and the Party Council. In May 1904, he published One Step Forward, <b>Two</b> <b>Steps</b> Back, a booklet claiming that Martov's supporters had tricked him into this.

Some party members attempted to reunite the feuding factions, but this failed, and by the spring, all eight members of the Central Committee were Bolsheviks.
