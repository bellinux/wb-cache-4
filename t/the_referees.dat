5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted <b>the</b> <b>referees,</b> Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The refereeing {{department}} {{was established in}} 1919 and is currently the largest football refereeing division in Europe, with 110 referees, with 2 of them women. <b>The</b> <b>referees</b> mainly officiate amateur games in the local Munich leagues.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen referees {{participated in}} the tournament: four Europeans – two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin Rădulescu, also the Romanian team coach), and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans. In order to {{eliminate}} differences {{in the application of}} the Laws of the Game, <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>referee</b> has final {{decision-making}} {{authority on}} all matters. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> is assisted by two assistant <b>referees</b> who advise <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> An assistant referee's judgement is only enforced if <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> accepts that judgement, and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> has <b>the</b> authority to unilaterally overrule an assistant <b>referee.</b> <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> is <b>the</b> only official empowered with starting and stopping play, and meting out disciplinary actions such as cautions or send-offs.|$|R
50|$|All {{decisions}} by <b>the</b> assistant <b>referees</b> are only advisory to <b>the</b> <b>referee,</b> i.e. their decisions are not binding and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> {{is allowed to}} overrule an assistant. An assistant referee may also be called upon by <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> to provide an opinion regarding matters which <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> requires clarification on. Occasionally <b>the</b> assistant <b>referee</b> will assist in player management during free kicks, {{as well as provide}} visual assistance during penalty kicks. <b>The</b> assistant <b>referees</b> also usually assist <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> with preparatory and administrative functions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a cut to the head, it is <b>the</b> <b>referee's</b> {{responsibility}} of taking the injured boxer to a medical doctor seated at ringside as many times as <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> thinks necessary, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>referee's</b> decision of <b>the</b> cut being provoked by a punch or not. When the doctor tells <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> that <b>the</b> combatant cannot go on, <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> must stop <b>the</b> fight. If <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> decided that <b>the</b> cut was caused by a punch, the other boxer wins by technical knockout. If <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> decides it was produced by a collision, the judges at ringside must hand over their scorecards, and the fighter ahead on points wins by technical decision.|$|R
5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched {{the ball out of}} Johnson's hands while he was trying to score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E
5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> working this game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{lost the}} April 8 {{national}} championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E

5|$|The final series went {{to seven}} games, with the Flames {{suffering}} a controversial non-goal in game six at home. Replays showed that Martin Gelinas may have scored {{what would have}} been the go-ahead goal late in the third period; however, <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> never signalled a goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive. The goal would have made Gelinas the only player in NHL history to score the winning goal in every playoff series en route to winning the Stanley Cup. The Lightning would go on to win the game in double overtime, before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup. Despite the loss, 30,000 fans packed into Olympic Plaza to celebrate the Flames run.|$|E
50|$|In {{situations}} where an assistant referee {{is unable to}} continue, the fourth official replaces that assistant referee.

50|$|A quantum {{interactive}} proof {{with two}} competing provers is a generalization {{of the single}} prover quantum interactive proof system. It can be modelled by zero-sum refereed games where Alice and Bob are the competing provers, and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> is <b>the</b> verifier. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> {{is assumed to be}} computationally bounded (polynomial size quantum circuit), whereas Alice and Bob can be computationally unrestricted. Alice, Bob and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> receive a common string, and after fixed rounds of interactions (exchanging quantum information between the provers and <b>the</b> <b>referee),</b> <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> decides whether Alice wins or Bob wins.|$|R
5000|$|Quantum {{interactive}} proof {{systems with}} competing provers is a generalization {{of the classical}} RG where <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> is now restricted to polynomial-time generated quantum circuits and may exchange quantum information with the players. Therefore, QRG {{can be seen as}} the following problem. Alice, Bob and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> is given some statement (it may involve a quantum state). Alice is trying to convince <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> <b>the</b> statement is true while Bob is trying to convince <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> <b>the</b> statement is false. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> can ask <b>the</b> provers questions via quantum states, receive answers in quantum states, and analyse the received quantum states using a quantum computer. After communicating with Alice and Bob for [...] rounds, <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> decides whether <b>the</b> statement is true or false.

5|$|The {{published}} work was criticised {{on the grounds}} that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E
5|$|Schmid left UCLA {{to replace}} Octavio Zambrano {{as head coach}} of the Los Angeles Galaxy five games into the 1999 MLS season. At the time, the team was ranked fifth in the Western Conference with a tally of only three goals. Under Schmid in the {{remainder}} of the season, the team had a record of 17–9, finished with the second-best record in the league and won their conference, earning him the MLS Coach of the Year Award. The team's captain, Robin Fraser, gave credit to Schmid's emphasis on defense after being named the MLS defender of the year. Los Angeles lost 2–0 to D.C. United in that year's MLS Cup. Schmid made critical comments of <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> after the match; he received a $1,000 fine and suspension for {{the first game of the}} following season.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens' first regular-season {{win over}} the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was {{emotional}} as receiver Torrey Smith was competing {{following the death of}} his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead {{in the first half and}} led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.|$|E

5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} contest, Ric Flair and Razor Ramon {{wrestled}} against Mr. Perfect and Randy Savage. Ramon and Perfect began the match, but Flair entered after Perfect insulted him. Perfect threw Flair into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried {{him over the}} top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked Flair and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over Flair. From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and Flair and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, Perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin Flair, but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric Flair attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. Perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, Flair attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Perfect tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered as Perfect attempted to pin Flair with a PerfectPlex. Flair escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked Perfect until <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and Flair were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to Perfect and Savage.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. <b>The</b> <b>referees</b> stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E

50|$|In {{association}} football, {{an assistant}} referee (AR, {{known as a}} linesman or lineswoman before 1996, expressions which are still in common unofficial use) is an official empowered with assisting <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> in enforcing <b>the</b> Laws of the Game during a match. At most organised levels of football the match officiating crew consists of <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> and two assistant referees, with one assistant referee assigned to each touchline. <b>The</b> assistant <b>referee's</b> duties generally consist of judging when the ball has left the field of play - including which team is entitled to return the ball to play, judging when an offside offence has occurred, and advising <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> when an infringement of the Laws of the Game has occurred out {{of his or her}} view. Depending on the local match rules and the discretion of <b>the</b> <b>referee,</b> an assistant referee may also be responsible for various administrative tasks, for example managing substitutions, helping <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> control <b>the</b> players, or replacing <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> {{if he or she is}} unable to continue. <b>The</b> assistant <b>referee</b> functions in an advisory role, and all judgements made by an assistant referee may be overruled by <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b>|$|R
5|$|The final {{match was}} the Royal Rumble match. Before the match, Kurt Angle stole Nunzio's {{entrance}} number and replaced {{him in the}} match. The participants divided into their brands and fought against each other, working together to eliminate Muhammad Hassan, the thirteen entrant. Scotty 2 Hotty, the fifteenth entrant, was attacked by Hassan during his entrance and never entered the match. Angle, the twentieth entrant, dominated upon entering until Shawn Michaels eliminated him. Angle came back to eliminate Michaels and attacked him. The final four participants remaining were Batista, United States Champion John Cena, Edge, and Rey Mysterio. Edge fought with Mysterio, executing a spear to eliminate Mysterio. Cena and Batista then eliminated Edge as he was attacking them. Cena tried to perform an FU on Batista but Batista countered. Batista then attempted a Batista Bomb but was countered with a headscissors takedown by Cena, sending both over the top rope and touching the floor at the same time. <b>The</b> <b>referees</b> for the Raw brand believed Batista to be the winner while the SmackDown! referees believed Cena to be winner. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came to the ring, in the process legitimately tearing both his quadriceps muscles, and ordered the match to be restarted with the final two participants. Batista eliminated Cena following a Spinebuster to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second timeout in order to stop the game clock from ticking down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the short run, Tech was forced to call the timeout. Following the timeout, the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a short run. Another short run brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final timeout to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play that kept the clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other way to stop the clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E
