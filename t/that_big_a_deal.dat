[...] Lintz learned of Sophia's fate [...] "about a month before we shot it, which was good, because sometimes they just let you find things out from reading the script, so that was fortunate. producer Gale Ann Hurd actually called and told us.

5000|$|During this period, Nicklaus {{also let}} his {{physical}} condition decline somewhat, putting on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition {{in the fall}} of 1969 by losing 25 lb in one month, and his game started to return to top form. In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole. Nicklaus threw his putter into the air after sinking the winning putt, as he was thrilled to have won the Open at the home of golf, St Andrews. He describes this period in his life:I was playing good golf, but it really wasn't <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> to me one way or the other.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the significance of}} participant assigned acceptability ratings for the post-adjectival degree construction ADJ (of/ 0) NP. The majority of studies in sociolinguistic variation have investigated phonological variables, such as alveolarization of (ing) and reduction or deletion of (t/d). Studies on syntactic variation often examine multiple realizations of a variable or the distribution of several variables. However, we base our study on Rickford et al. ’s (1995) finding that syntactic variables can also be successfully isolated. In the present study, we describe a current change in progress involving a previously unstudied syntactic variable: post-adjectival (of) in degree constructions such as “It’s not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> (of) <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> ” We analyzed 3, 600 tokens collected from 150 participants in the Washington, DC, area, and found significance in participant age, participant ethnicity, and the linguistic conditioning of the phrase, all affecting the acceptability rating given to the construction. Most notably, we found that acceptability of (of) is negatively correlated with age. The younger participants showed a strong preference for constructions with (of), whereas older informants overall preferred (0) constructions. Our findings suggest that this feature {{is part of an}} ongoing change in progress in Washington, DC...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{is said to}} be {{influenced}} by a broad range of music and as individuals they possess different influences. Post-hardcore bands like Thursday, Refused, At the Drive-In, It's Not <b>That</b> <b>Big</b> of <b>a</b> <b>Deal,</b> MKC and Glassjaw are just some examples of commonalities amongst the band. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt has said that the band with each record takes influences from other artists and musicians who are [...] "pushing the envelope and challenging themselves." [...] Vander Lugt personally cites his influences from blues and jazz musicians. Dreyer has stated his lyrical influences are derived from fiction writers rather than from poetry, as he likes to approach writing through stories and different characters. Particularly citing Kurt Vonnegut, Vladimir Nabokov as literary influences, and cites books from Nabokov like Pale Fire and Lolita as some of his favorites. The band credits now defunct Michigan based rock bands Ivan and Coal Black Horse as having a significant influence on La Dispute. Jacob Fricke of The Badger Herald commented on how Black Flag's third album combination of spoken word on its A-side and their typical [...] "hard-and-fast punk" [...] on the B-side acted as an influence on La Dispute's style.|$|R

The law scholars have put all their efforts, aiming to elaborate a theory that brings a structure to the legal system, thus defining the parameters to the tough task which is the law enforcement. Therefore, as the society becomes more and more complex, new situations arise and they demand a greater law flexibility.

In this case, such a wide researching field is going to be undertaken from a booth cognitive and textual typology perspective. To concrete this approach, we have selected two verbs «exponer» y «explicar» <b>that</b> share <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of meaning as verbal communication verbs, but that present important differences in their syntactic and semantic respective structures. We propose that those differences can be considered as relevant to define the narrow boundaries between their correspondent discursive activities: la explicación y la exposición usually confused and mixed in many textual typologies. In order to follow their historical development we have also researched in their Latin and Rhetorical origins —as verbs and as discourses— {{as well as in the}} accuracy of the definitions of the concepts along Spanish Academic Dictionaries.

40|$|The advancements in {{computing}} {{have led}} to tremendous increase {{in the amount of}} data being generated every minute, which needs to be stored or transferred maintaining high level of security. The military and armed forces today heavily rely on computers to store huge amount of important and secret data, <b>that</b> holds <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> for the security of the Nation. The traditional standard AES encryption algorithm being the heart of almost every application today, although gives a high amount of security, is time consuming with the traditional sequential approach. Implementation of AES on GPUs is an ongoing research since few years, which still is either inefficient or incomplete, and demands for optimizations for better performance. Considering the limitations in previous research works as a research gap, this paper aims to exploit efficient parallelism on the GPU, and on multi-core CPU, to make a fair and reliable comparison. Also it aims to deduce implementation techniques on multi-core CPU and GPU, in order to utilize them for future implementations. This paper experimentally examines the performance of a CPU and GPGPU in different levels of optimizations using Pthreads, CUDA and CUDA STREAMS. It critically exploits the behaviour of a GPU for different granularity levels and different grid dimensions, to examine the effect on the performance.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes a}} new approach to evaluating Big Deal packages. This approach enables librarians to negotiate with publishers more effectively by comparing the cost per download of package titles with the expected cost per download of competing publishers’ titles currently provided through interlibrary loan. The element of competition compensates for the effect of inflated journal list prices and, in some cases, will show <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> package is not the most cost effective way to provide access to articles. The model uses a publisher’s list price and JR 1 data for all titles within a package to sort titles by cost per download. Additionally, the model combines a library’s interlibrary loan data with journal title list prices to produce an equivalent list of titles from a variety of publishers. These two lists are combined with additional data which reflects each library’s individual circumstance, including budget, usage inflation, and interlibrary loan costs. The resulting output is a blended list of package titles and individual titles from other publishers to which the library could afford subscriptions {{as an alternative to the}} package <b>deal,</b> while maintaining <b>a</b> sufficient budget to provide all non-subscribed material through interlibrary loan. The presentation is in the form of a case study which describes the model developed by California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo) for use by the California State University system in their current negotiations with publishers.

[...] Ziva {{seems to be more}} willing to show her vulnerability to Gibbs than to most of the other characters, and Michael Weatherly suggested in 2012 that she might have become something of a [...] "hellcat" [...] without Gibbs' guidance. Additionally, Ziva and Gibbs share several characteristics: they both rarely show emotion, speak several languages, and are extremely skilled at what they do. Though she often finds it difficult to follow his orders due to the autonomy she had as a Mossad control officer, Ziva looks up to Gibbs as a leader and often restrains herself from resorting to her assassin background in situations where he would not approve. He often uses this background to their advantage, however, by choosing her to interrogate certain suspects.Of all her relationships with the team, Ziva and Gibbs' has undergone the most growth. Initially, Gibbs distrusts Ziva as she is Ari Haswari's control agent. Ziva also bears the brunt of Gibbs' anger after Caitlin Todd was murdered. Ziva ultimately kills Ari, who was also her half brother, in order to save Gibbs' life. This event serves as the initial foundation for their relationship, and Gibbs takes responsibility for Ari's shooting in order to spare Ziva further pain.|$|R

40|$|All {{the engines}} were both {{qualification}} and acceptance tested at Marquardt s facilities. After {{we won the}} Apollo Program contract, we went off and built two vacuum test facilities, which simulated altitude continuous firing {{for as long as}} we wanted to run an engine. They would run days and days with the same capability we had on steam ejection. We did all of the testing in both for the qualification and the acceptance test. One of them was a large ball, which was an eighteen-foot diameter sphere, evacuated again with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> steam ejector system {{that could be used for}} system testing; that s where we did the Lunar Excursion Module testing. We put the whole cluster in there and tested the entire cluster at the simulated altitude conditions. The lowest altitude we tested at - typically an acceptance test - was 105, 000 feet simulated altitude. The big ball - because people were interested in what they called goop formation, which is an unburned hydrazine product migrating to cold surfaces on different parts of spacecraft - was built to address those kinds of issues. We ran long-life tests in a simulated space environment with the entire inside of the test cell around the test article, liquid nitrogen cooled, so it could act as getter for any of the exhaust products. That particular facility could pull down to about 350, 000 feet (atmosphere) equivalent altitude, which was pushing pretty close to the thermodynamic triple point of the MMH. It was a good test facility. Those facilities are no longer there. When the guys at Marquardt sold the company to what eventually became part of Aerojet, all those test facilities were cut off at the roots. I think they have a movie studio there at this point. That part of it is truly not recoverable, but it did some excellent high-altitude, space-equivalent testing at the time. Surprisingly, we had very few problems while testing in the San Fernando Valley. In the early 1960 s, nobody had ever seen dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4), so <b>that</b> wasn't too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> We really did only make small, red clouds. In all the hundreds of thousands of tests and probably well over one million firings that I was around that place for, in all that thirty-something years, we had a total of one serious injury associated with rocket engine testing and propellants. Because we were trying to figure out what propellants would really be good, we tried all of the fun stuff like the carbon tetrafluoride, chlorine pentafluoride, and pure fluorine. The materials knowledge wasn't all that great at the time. On one test, the fluorine we had didn't react well with the copper they were using for tubing, and it managed to cause another unscheduled disassembly of the facility. It was very serious. It's like one of those Korean War stories. The technician happened to be walking past the test facility when it decided to blow itself up. A piece of copper tubing pierced one cheek and came out the other. That was the only serious accident in all of the engines handled in all those years. Now, we did have a problem with the EPA later because they figured out what the brown clouds were about. We built a whole bunch of exhaust mitigation scrubbers to take care of engine testing in the daytime. In general, we operated the big shuttle (RCS) engine, the 870 - pounder at nominal conditions; they scrubbed the effluents pretty well. If you operated that same 870 -pound force engine at a level where you get a lot of excess oxidizer, yeah, there s a brown cloud. But, you know, it doesn't show up well in the dark. They did do some of that. But, that s gone; it was addressed one way or another. RELEASED...|$|R
