5000|$|In 1978, Hinton met the folklorist Glenn Hinson, who {{arranged}} for her {{performance at the}} 1978 North Carolina Folklife Festival. She subsequently performed at the National Folk Festival, the University of Chicago Folk Festival, and in 1985 at an event called [...] "Southern Roots" [...] at Carnegie Hall that featured Delta and Piedmont blues artists.' In 1998 she made her only trip to Europe performing for the Blues Al Femminile series in Turin, Italy.

50|$|Once the HLA-A {{protein is}} {{completely}} translated, {{it must be}} folded into the proper shape. A molecular chaperone protein called calnexin and an enzyme called ERp57 assist in the folding process. Calnexin holds the HLA-A heavy chain while Erp57 catalyzes disulfide bonds between the heavy chain and the light, β2-microglobulin chain. This bond induces a conformational change in the heavy chain, forming the binding groove. Calnexin then dissociates with the complex, now {{referred to as a}} peptide loading complex, and is replaced by calreticulin, another chaperone protein. Short peptides are continually transported from around the cell into the ER lumen by a specialized transport protein called TAP. TAP then binds to the peptide loading complex along with another protein, called tapasin. At this point the peptide loading complex consists of HLA-A (heavy chain), β2-microglobulin (light chain), an ERp57 enzyme, calreticulin chaperone protein, TAP (with a bound peptide fragment), and tapasin. Tapasin increases the stability of TAP, in addition to stabilizing the entire peptide loading complex. At this point <b>TAP</b> <b>releases</b> the peptide it transported into the ER lumen. The proximity of the HLA-A binding groove to TAP is ensured by the peptide loading complex. This increases the likelihood that the peptide will find the groove. If the peptide's affinity for the HLA-A protein is great enough, it binds in the groove. Research suggests that tapasin may actively load peptides from TAP into the HLA-A complex while also holding class I molecules in the ER lumen until a high affinity peptide has been bound.|$|R
5000|$|As water {{passes through}} the {{distribution}} system, the water quality can degrade by chemical reactions and biological processes. Corrosion of metal pipe materials in the distribution system can cause the release of metals into the water with undesirable aesthetic and health effects. Release of iron from unlined iron pipes can result in customer reports of [...] "red water" [...] at the <b>tap</b> [...] <b>Release</b> of copper from copper pipes can result in customer reports of [...] "blue water" [...] and/or a metallic taste. Release of lead can occur from the solder used to join copper pipe together or from brass fixtures. Copper and lead levels at the consumer's tap are regulated to protect consumer health.|$|R
5000|$|A primary {{component}} of the warp drive method of propulsion in the Star Trek universe is the [...] "gravimetric field displacement manifold", more {{commonly referred to as}} a warp core. It is a fictional reactor that <b>taps</b> the energy <b>released</b> in a matter-antimatter annihilation to provide the energy necessary to power a starship's warp drive, allowing faster-than-light travel. Starship warp cores generally also serve as powerplants for other primary ship systems.|$|R
5000|$|Early in the tour, {{there was}} also a dwarf that was dressed to look like the demon-infant from the album cover. The {{dimension}} problems and use of dwarfs bear strong similarities to the infamous Stonehenge scene in the movie This Is Spinal <b>Tap,</b> which was <b>released</b> a year after Sabbath's tour. This is undoubtedly a coincidence, however, because the [...] "Stonehenge scene" [...] was already in a 20-minute early demo of the film from 1982.|$|R
5000|$|A knockbox (informally {{known as}} a [...] "bash bin" [...] or [...] "coffee column") is a device used to store spent espresso grounds, called a puck, after a shot of espresso has been pulled. It is {{generally}} made out of stainless steel or plastic, and has a sturdy bar {{known as a}} [...] "bash bar", against which a portafilter is <b>tapped</b> to <b>release</b> the puck. Because the espresso puck is typically very hot after extraction, knockboxes need to be sturdy. Further, they are also subject to repetitive knocking and tapping to dislodge espresso after use, and thus rubber and stainless steel are {{the most commonly used}} materials. In various coffee houses they are seen as drawers which are integral within the bar structure, or as stainless steel boxes usually located near the grinder for convenience.|$|R
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the gas operation {{is that it allows}} the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. [...] Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas-operated mechanism are the large size of the Desert Eagle, {{and the fact that it}} discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing could clog the gas <b>release</b> <b>tap,</b> preventing proper function.|$|R
5000|$|A further album, Bum Raps and Love <b>Taps,</b> was <b>released</b> in Europe in late 2005/early 2006 on the Naive {{label and}} lead to the band touring in Europe for much of 2005 and 2006. The album is {{dedicated}} to Charles' grandmother, about whom the title track was written. Another song [...] "'Duel with Cudgels", eight minutes and thirty seconds, takes its title from a Goya painting. Their music is lush and melancholy, with poetic and sometimes surreal lyrics. In fall 2006, the video artist Vincent Moon filmed two live videos of Elysian Fields for La Blogotheque (also seen on YouTube), {{one of which is}} for the song [...] "We're in Love", the duo acoustic final track on the Bum Raps album. This album was finally released in the US in late 2008 on the band's Diluvian imprint.|$|R
5000|$|On September 11, 2007 Nate True <b>released</b> <b>Tap</b> Tap Revolution (named after, {{and based}} on, the popular music game series Dance Dance Revolution) for iOS via his {{personal}} blog. [...] The game pre-dated {{the release of}} the iOS SDK, and players were required to jailbreak their iPhone to play the game. The game had been developed by True within a two-day time span. Soon after that release came a new user interface from Tino Bedi (Doc). [...] and the ability to play songs from your iTunes library and share tap tracks in the cloud. It soon {{became one of the most}} popular games for jailbroken iPhones, and received media attention.|$|R
5000|$|Tap Tap Revenge {{features}} {{a mix of}} both major and independent musicians. Some songs have been specifically written for the game, but most were written independently. Most songs are available in only one playable mode, but some {{have more than one}} version playable for multiple difficulty modes. Prior to the release of the sequel Tap Tap Revenge 2, new songs were typically released for download through the game on Thursdays, and the event was dubbed [...] "Tap Tap Thursdays" [...] by Tapulous. [...] Although Tap Tap Thursdays still existed after the sequels of Tap <b>Tap</b> Revenge were <b>released,</b> new songs are only released for the latest flagship game. Below is a list of songs available for the game: ...|$|R
5000|$|Bad News {{made their}} {{television}} debut during 1983, {{in the first}} series of The Comic Strip Presents... (written by Edmondson, and produced by Michael White/Comic Strip Productions). The episode, [...] "Bad News Tour", {{took the form of}} a satirical fly-on-the-wall rockumentary, in which the incompetent band is followed travelling to a gig in Grantham, by an almost equally inept documentary film crew: It seemed to take much inspiration from Mark Kidel's 1976 BBC documentary So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star? that followed the Kursaal Flyers around Scotland and northeast England. The episode was also coincidentally in production {{at the same time as}} This Is Spinal <b>Tap,</b> which was <b>released</b> the following year to a much wider audience and subsequently greater acclaim.|$|R
50|$|Tap Tap Revenge Tour was {{the fifth}} and final {{flagship}} game in the <b>Tap</b> <b>Tap</b> series, <b>released</b> on July 12, 2012. This version featured a new intro, menu, and tapper {{as well as a}} new mode of playing, 'Tour'. The App was free to download in the App Store before its discontinuation. An ad-free paid version was also available. A new song was released everyday to play for free and users could also purchase several new premium tracks.The gameplay featured a new tapper which was sliced upwards and also replaced the shake arrows with a shake bar.In Tour mode players went on one-week-long tours doing shows in different cities. The main goal of the tour was to score a high enough percent to move onto the next performance. If players did well enough on the first three shows they would unlock two encore performances for bonus points and rewards.Points were added up from all the performances in each tour and players were given a score for the week.The app also featured a Tour Wall, a space for players to display awards and purchased goods. An item for the wall was awarded each day if a player completed both encore performances in that days' shows.|$|R
