25|$|Kray {{was one of}} {{the best}} representatives of the old Austrian army. Tied to an {{obsolete}} system, and unable, from habit, to realize the changed conditions of warfare, he failed, but his enemies held him in the highest respect as a brave, skilful, and chivalrous opponent. It was he who, at Altenkirchen, cared for the dying Marceau (1796), and the white uniforms of Kray and his staff mingled with <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French in the funeral procession of the young general of the Republic.|$|E
25|$|The invisibility {{effect was}} {{achieved}} by having someone wearing a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky) {{the size of the}} Predator. The red was removed with chroma key techniques, leaving an empty area. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} diving is {{commonly}} used in Philippines waters for pa-aling fishing, which is fishing with big nets on coral reef areas where a surface-dragged net would snag on coral; the compressor air hoses are also {{used to make a}} curtain of bubbles to corral and herd the fish into the nets, since muro-ami fishing was stopped in the area. At least one pa-aling fishing fleet has been found and arrested in a protected fishery area. Compressor diving was shown, and so called, used for pa-aling fishing, in episode 1 (Oceans: Into <b>the</b> <b>Blue)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC television series Human Planet. The cameramen used ordinary scuba gear, but one of them had a trial-dive with the crew's compressor-diving gear.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Navy from 1950 to 2001 used a {{modified}} version of the British Naval jack, with the Union flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton. In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the St. George's cross design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to include the Devanagari script: सत्यमेव जयते (Satyameva Jayate) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in Sanskrit.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of primary color—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several deciduous woody plants of the genus Populus. Though native to many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (la banlieue ouest) where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, Courbevoie. The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887. Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers would have been unthinkable in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.|$|E
500|$|Following the war, Smythe {{returned}} to Toronto. With his accrued Army salary and {{the proceeds from}} the sale of his homestead plot, he [...] started a sand and gravel business. For a while, the business became a partnership with Frank Angotti, who owned a paving business. To support the need for sand and gravel, Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a sand pit. He {{returned to}} the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920. Irene and Conn were married during the school year. Smythe and his paving business partner split, and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business. The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was [...] "C. Smythe for sand", which he had painted on his trucks, the lettering in white on <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trucks. Frank Selke, who had moved to Toronto, was one of Smythe's first employees in the business. Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone as well as taking care of newborn son Stafford.

Its memory is preserved by the moniker [...] "Leatherneck", and the high collar on Marine dress uniforms. Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Colonial Marines carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from the red of the British or <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army and Navy.

2500|$|Ru ware, Ju ware, or [...] "Ru {{official}} ware" [...] (...) is {{a famous}} and extremely rare type of Chinese pottery from the Song dynasty, produced for the imperial court {{for a brief}} period around 1100.

[...] Most have a distinctive pale [...] "duck-egg" [...] blue glaze, [...] "like <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky in a clearing amongst the clouds after rain" [...] according to a medieval connoisseur, and are otherwise undecorated, though their colours vary and reach into a celadon green.

[...] They can be considered as a particular form of celadon wares.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 September 1776, the Marine Committee apportioned {{a uniform}} for the Continental Marines. [...] The uniform {{regulations}} specified that standard uniform {{was a short}} green coat with white trim facings (lapels, cuffs, and coat lining), and a high leather collar to protect against cutlass slashes and to keep a man's head erect, leading to the nickname [...] "leatherneck"; complemented by a white waistcoat, white or buff short breeches, woolen stockings, and a short black gaiter. [...] Marine officers wore small cocked hats, and a single epaulette; and the enlisted men sported round black hats with the brim pinned on one side. [...] The adoption of green coats and round hats probably reflects the constraints of availability, for both of the uniform attire were used by the Philadelphia Associators. [...] It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers. Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Continental Marines mostly carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army and Navy or the red of the British.

2500|$|His first {{commercial}} sponsor on radio was Cremo Cigars and increasingly his fame spread nationwide. After {{a long run}} in New York, Bing went back to Hollywood to film The Big Broadcast and his personal appearances, his records, and his radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first full-length film brought him a contract with Paramount and he began a regular pattern of making three films a year. On radio, he fronted his own show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons and gradually his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hit after hit {{at a time when}} record sales generally were in decline because of the Depression. Critically acclaimed audio engineer Steve Hoffman once stated: [...] "By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good." [...] His social life was hectic, his first son Gary was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he'd replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the prestigious NBC radio program Kraft Music Hall, the weekly radio program where he remained for the next ten years.
