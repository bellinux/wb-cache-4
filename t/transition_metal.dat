5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E

Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> series. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E

30|$|Although no {{work has}} been {{reported}} till now on the catalytic effect of <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> on AB 5 -type hydrogen storage alloy, similar results {{have been found in}} studies of the effect of <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> on MgH 2 system. It has been shown that addition of <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> during ball-milling of MgH 2 reduces the activation energy, thus improves absorption–desorption kinetics very much [8, 13]. Co {{has been found to be}} most effective in formation of large amount of MgH 2 [9]. According to Liang et al., <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> are good catalyst for chemisorptions of hydrogen. They reduce the nucleation barrier and thus enhance the kinetics [8].|$|R
5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a <b>transition</b> <b>metal.</b> They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E

5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23.

5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the most}} corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> {{often found in}} the minerals pyrochlore (the main commercial source for niobium) and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E

5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert <b>transition</b> <b>metal.</b> It is a noble metal {{and a member}} of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as {{a chemical}} compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.|$|E
5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E

30|$|Another type of {{materials}} that are considered to exhibit SERS activity is <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Due to their unique d-band electrons, the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> can efficiently intermediate various chemical reactions under proper electric bias, which makes them excellent catalysis in various electrochemical reactions. It is therefore possible to combine the SERS and electrocatalytic behaviors of the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> as powerful manner to in situ monitor the interfacial reactions. In these regards, various <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> such as Ni, Fe, Ru, and Co, have been cultivated as SERS substrates since the 1990 s [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Some of them have even been utilized for investigating the adsorption behavior of organic molecules [23], opening up new avenues for designing of novel surface characterization techniques.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. First {{principle}} calculations {{were performed}} on the electronic and magnetic structures of the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> doped GaN. Seven elements in 3 d <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> from V to Cu were used as a dopant. Magnetic phase was stable compared to non-magnetic phase for all <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> doped GaN. Total magnetic moments followed Hund’s rule to maximize the magnetic moment. Transition element projected magnetic moments showed that most of magnetic moments were concentrated on <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> {{in the cases of}} V, Cr, and Mn doped GaN, which could not be used for DMS. Since Fe and Ni doped GaNs are intrinsic insulators, Fe and Ni doped GaNs could not be used for DMS materials unless additional dopants are introduced. The most probable candidates for DMS applications were predicted to be Co or Cu doped GaNs, respectively...|$|R
5|$|The {{definition}} of a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell. By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a <b>transition</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
