40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{collagen}} scaffold {{was designed}} {{for use as a}} template for the regeneration of meniscal cartilage and was tested in ten patients in an initial, Food and Drug Administration-approved, clinical fea-sibility trial. The goal {{of the study was to}} evaluate the implantability and safety of the scaffold as well as its ability to support tissue ingrowth. The study was based on the findings of in vitro and in vivo investi-gations in dogs that had demonstrated cellular in-growth and tissue regeneration through the scaffold. Nine patients remained in the study for at least <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months,</b> and one patient voluntarily withdrew after three months for personal reasons. The collagen scaffold was found to be implantable and to be safe over the three-year period. Histologi-cally, it supported regeneration of tissue in meniscal defects of various sizes. No adverse immunological re-actions were noted on sequential serological testing. On second-look arthroscopy, performed either three or six months after implantation, gross and histologi-cal evaluation revealed newly formed tissue replacing the implant as it was resorbed. At <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months,</b> the nine patients reported a decrease in the symp-toms. According to a scale that assigned 1 point for strenuous activity and 5 points for an inability to per-form sports activity, the average score was 1. 5 points before the injury, 3. 0 points after the injury and be-fore the operation, and 2. 4 points at six months post-operatively, 2. 2 points at twelve months, 2. 0 points at twenty-four months, and 1. 9 points at <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months.</b> According to a scale that assigned 0 points for no pain and 3 points for severe pain, the average *One or more of the authors has received or will receive bene-fits for personal or professional use from a commercial party related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the mass of a {{ballasted}} roof can reduce peak roof temperatures and delay the heat flow into a building. Although ballasted roofs perform these “cool ” functions, they do not meet the traditional requirement of high solar reflectance. This is one of the criteria set out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other organizations in order for a roof to be “cool. ” To address whether ballasted roofing systems offer energy efficiency benefits similar to cool roofs, a project to perform side-by-side experiments was initiated. Different loadings of stone-ballasted roofs and an uncoated paver-ballasted roof were compared to roofs under exposed black and white membranes. The six test sections were constructed and installed on a test building at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and monitored for energy performance for <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months.</b> One year into the project, systems with two loadings of pavers coated with a white coating were added.

This study design was a prospective, non-experimental psychometric evaluation of the N-PASS tool. The research was conducted at a Midwestern Medical Center. The sample analyzed comprised forty subjects aged one to <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months.</b> Data collection involved the evaluation of participants every five minutes, utilizing the N-PASS sedation subscale along with the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) and the N-PASS pain/agitation subscale along with the Face, Legs, Arms, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) tool. All subjects were observed for a minimum of ten observations. The results showed that the Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alphas of the N-PASS sedation scale ranged from. 853 to. 923, and from. 935 to. 971 for the N-PASS pain/agitation scale. Correlations between the N-PASS sedation scale and the UMSS tool ranged from. 847 to. 967. Correlations between the N-PASS pain/agitation scale and the FLACC tool ranged from. 980 to. 996. Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis revealed that the N-PASS sedation score decreased linearly over time. Repeated Measures ANOVA indicated that the N-PASS pain/agitation scores changed over time, but not at a linear, quadratic, or cubic form. Regression analysis revealed a statistically non-significant linear trend for the prediction of amount of time spent in PACU as a function of change in sedation levels from time 1 to time 10.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{retrospectively}} {{analyzed the}} cases of fifty children with unilateral congenital dislocation of the hip {{in an attempt to}} determine what factors in treatment were associated with the prevention of avas-cular necrosis of the femoral head. All children were less than <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months</b> old at the initiation of treatment, had no other anomalies, had their entire treatment rendered at the same institution, and were followed for at least one year after reduction. Avascular necrosis occurred in 36 per cent of the patients; in all cases definite roentgenographic signs were apparent within twelve months of reduction. No patient whose hip had grown normally during the first twelve months after reduction later had avascular ne-crosis. The management strategy for congenital disloca-tion of the hip in the child who is less than <b>thirty-six</b> <b>months</b> old should include a minimum two-week period of traction until achievement of the + 2 traction station and immobilization in the so-called human position fol-lowing reduction. Skeletal traction, gradually in-creased over several weeks to an average of 39 per cent of body weight, usually was required to attain the + 2 station. Observation of these principles should de-crease the incidence of avascular necrosis and increase the probability of obtaining a normal hip. Congenital dislocation of the hip is a complex or-thopaedic problem requiring sophisticated treatment. En-rors in management can result in a painful, unstable hip. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head, the most serious iatrogenic complication, occurs only following treat-ment 4. Although some children with this complication may ultimately have a normal hip, many more will require subsequent reconstructive operations.
