2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What I do for {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. I have a different set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>on</b> personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>on.</b> He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup.

2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran goaded assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>on</b> the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Lance Ito of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E
