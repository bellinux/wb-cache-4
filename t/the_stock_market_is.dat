25|$|A {{private equity}} fund say for example, ABC Capital II, borrows $9bn from a bank (or other lender). To this it adds $2bn of equity – money from its own {{partners}} and from limited partners (pension funds, rich individuals, etc.). With this $11bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company, XYZ Industrial (after due diligence, i.e. checking the books). It replaces the senior management in XYZ Industrial, and {{they set out to}} streamline it. The workforce is reduced, some assets are sold off, etc. The objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale. <b>The</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a bull market, and XYZ Industrial is sold two years after the buy-out for $13bn, yielding a profit of $2bn. The original loan can now be paid off with interest of say $0.5bn. The remaining profit of $1.5bn is shared among the partners. Taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates. Note that part of that profit results from turning the company around, and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market, the latter often being the greater component.|$|E

This result is also the theoretical justification for the forecasting of broad economic trends, which is provided by a variety of groups including non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions (such as brokerage houses and consulting companies).|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 1929, {{the market value of}} all shares listed on <b>the</b> New York <b>Stock</b> Exchange fell by 30 percent. Many analysts then and now take <b>the</b> view that <b>stocks</b> were then overvalued and <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> in need of a correction. But Irving Fisher argued at the time that instead, the {{fundamentals}} <b>were</b> strong and <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> undervalued. In this paper, we estimate the fundamental value of corporate equity in 1929 using data on stocks of productive capital and tax rates as in McGrattan and Prescott (2000, 2001) and compare it to actual stock valuations. We find that <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> did not crash in 1929 because the <b>market</b> <b>was</b> overvalued.
