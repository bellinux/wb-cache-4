25|$|The peasant {{associations}} face a {{cycle of}} poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow,</b> which reduces soil fertility. This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields. Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced. The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working {{the land and the}} productivity drops further.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{was not a}} {{profitable}} business for Bermudians in any case. The land area under cultivation was so small (especially by comparison to the plots granted settlers in Virginia), that fields could not be allowed <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow,</b> and farmers attempted to produce three crops each year. Islanders quickly turned to shipbuilding and maritime trades, but the Company, which gained its profits only from the land under cultivation, forbade the construction of any vessels without its license. Its interference in Bermudians livelihood would lead to its dissolution in 1684.|$|E

The river also provided access to hunting grounds, and other tribes. Access to the river was crucial, because Pamunkey villages were seldom permanent settlements. Because the Pamunkey people did not use fertilizers, they moved their fields and homes about every ten years to allow land <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow</b> and recover from cultivation.|$|E

50|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} is {{an agricultural}} {{system in which}} plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural vegetation while the cultivator moves on to another plot. The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or, more commonly, when the field is overrun by weeds. The length of time that a field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed <b>to</b> regenerate by <b>lying</b> <b>fallow.</b> This technique is often used in LEDCs (Less Economically Developed Countries) or LICs (Low Income Countries). In some areas, cultivators use a practice of slash-and-burn as one element of their farming cycle. Others employ land clearing without any burning, and some cultivators are purely migratory and do not use any cyclical method on a given plot. Sometimes no slashing at all is needed where regrowth is purely of grasses, an outcome not uncommon when soils are near exhaustion and need <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> fallow.In shifting agriculture, {{after two or three}} years of producing vegetable and grain crops on cleared land, the migrants abandon it for another plot. Trees, bushes and forests are cleared by slashing, and the remaining vegetation is burnt. The ashes add potash to the soil. Then the seeds are sown after the rains.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the future world food demand/supply balance for the next century, in {{relation}} to the land uses, we develop a model in which the society has to supply two types of food demand, namely, processed crop products and meat and dairy products. From the supply side, the society can resort to different classes of land. Each class of land can be allocated wholly or partially either to crop cultivation or to pasture or last <b>to</b> be <b>lain</b> <b>fallow.</b> Primary crop production can be transformed either into processed crop products to satisfy final needs, or into intermediate livestock products used as inputs within the intensive industrial farming system. The livestock products can also be obtained from the extensive grazing system. The increase in world population together with the increase in the per capita income boost the final demand for food products. In order to meet the future food demands, the structure of the livestock production system should be modified, the share of the intensive production system having to be increased. With respect to the optimal allocation of land, we have established different degrees of land scarcity. More precisely, as the land is getting scarcer, the share of the livestock products stemming from the intensive production system is steadily increasing. Thus, the cropland is rising at the expense of pastureland. The shadow value assigned to the different land classes is steadily increasing throughout the next century. aggregate supply and demand analysis, food prices, land-rent, land-use, Land Economics/Use, Q 11, Q 15, Q 24,...|$|R

For the next three months there would be nothing else for him to do but--to employ his own expressive phrase--"rot round." [...] In any event, it would be keeping him out of mischief. Veronica's governess was leaving. Veronica's governess generally does leave at the end of about a year. I think sometimes of advertising for a lady without a conscience. At the end of a year, they explain to me that their conscience will not allow them to remain longer; they do not feel they are earning their salary.

6000|$|The {{country to}} which I refer was a level and {{treeless}} plateau {{over which the}} winds cut like a whip. For miles on miles it was the same. A river, indeed, fell into the sea near the town where I resided; but {{the valley of the}} river was shallow and bald, for as far up as ever I had the heart to follow it. There were roads, certainly, but roads that had no beauty or interest; for, as there was no timber, and but little irregularity of surface, you saw your whole walk exposed to you from the beginning: {{there was nothing left to}} fancy, nothing to expect, nothing to see by the wayside, save here and there an unhomely-looking homestead, and here and there a solitary, spectacled stone-breaker; and you were only accompanied, as you went doggedly forward, by the gaunt telegraph-posts and the hum of the resonant wires in the keen sea-wind. To one who had learned to know their song in warm pleasant places by the Mediterranean, it seemed to taunt the country, and make it still bleaker by suggested contrast.

60|$|Once {{embarked}} {{upon his}} course, {{he never had}} a moment for reconstruction. He had no time to read, no time to think. A writer nowadays has to think in books and articles; to read a book he must criticize or edit it; if he dare attempt an experiment, a new departure, comes his agent in a panic. Every departure from the lines of his previous success involves chaffering, unless he chance to be a man of independent means. When one reflects on these things it is only amazing that the average book is not more copious and crude and hasty than it is, and how {{much in the way of}} comprehensive and unifying work is even now in progress. There are all too many books to read. It would be better for the public, better for our literature, altogether better, if this obligation to write perpetually were lifted. Few writers but must have felt at times the desire to stop and think, to work out some neglected corner of their minds, to admit a year's work as futile and thrust it behind the fire, or simply <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>fallow,</b> to camp and rest the horses. Let us, therefore, pay our authors as much not to write as though they wrote; instead of that twenty or thirty volumes, which is, I suppose, the average product, let us require a book or so, worth having. Which means, in fact, that we must find some way of giving an author, once he has proved his quality, a fixed income quite irrespective of what he does. We might, perhaps, require evidence that he was doing some work now and then, we might prohibit alien occupations, but for my own part I do not think even that is necessary. Most authors so sustained will write, and all will have written. We are presupposing, be it remembered, the stimulus of honours and criticism and of further honours and further emoluments.|$|E

In 1983 there were about 12,000 square kilometres (4,686 sq. mls.) in food production and in 1984 slightly more than 9,000 square kilometres (3,515 sq. mls).
