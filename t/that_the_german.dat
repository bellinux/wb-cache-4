5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> army was training pigeons for photography, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for pigeons {{as well as a}} method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 Der Spiegel {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> and Austrian broadcasters ZDF and ORF {{had produced}} a TV docudrama on Hitler's youth that portrayed {{the story of}} his infatuation with Stefanie Rabatsch.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Empire has {{any place in}} dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5000|$|The Polish Cipher Bureau {{recognized}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> {{were using}} a new cipher. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> had mistakenly shipped a cipher machine to Poland; their attempts to recover a shipment raised the suspicions of Polish customs, and the Polish Cipher Bureau learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were using an Enigma machine. [...] The Bureau purchased a commercial Enigma machine, and it attempted but failed to break the cipher.|$|R
5000|$|Sergi {{claimed the}} Nordics {{had made no}} {{substantial}} contribution to pre-modern civilization, noting <b>that</b> [...] "in <b>the</b> epoch of Tacitus <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> ... remained barbarians as in prehistoric times". He claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romans were unable to Romanize <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> because <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were averse to the Romans' civilizing influence. He rejected Germanic scholars' claims <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> were <b>the</b> saviors of a decadent post-Roman Italy. Instead Sergi claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were responsible for bringing forward the Dark Ages in the Medieval period and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> of <b>the</b> Medieval period were known for [...] "delinquency, vagabondage, and ferocity".|$|R

5|$|Some historians state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> troops did {{not expect}} the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, it {{was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Spring Offensive on the Western Front, which had forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front. This coincided with {{the approach of the}} campaigning season in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
50|$|The initial British success showed <b>that</b> even <b>the</b> strongest trench defences {{could be}} {{overcome}} by a surprise attack {{using a combination of}} new methods and equipment, reflecting a general increase in the British capacity to combine infantry, artillery, tanks and aircraft in attacks. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> revival after <b>the</b> shock of the British attack improved <b>German</b> morale but <b>the</b> potential for similar attacks meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> had to divert resources to anti-tank defences and weapons, an extra demand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> could ill afford to meet.|$|R

5|$|In 1967 the Polish {{military}} historian Władysław Kozaczuk, in {{his book}} Bitwa o tajemnice (The Battle for Secrets), first revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Kozaczuk's disclosure came seven years before F.W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret (1974) changed conventional views {{of the history of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality.|$|E

5000|$|In {{reply to}} Robertson's 19 November memo, which warned (correctly) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> would use <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} of Russia's {{departure from the}} war to attack in 1918 before the Americans were present in strength, Lloyd George wrote (wrongly) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> would not attack and would fail if they did. That autumn he declared {{that he was willing}} [...] "to risk his whole political reputation" [...] to avoid a repetition of the Somme or Passchendaele.|$|R
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|When United States agents {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> {{merchant ship}} Ypiranga was carrying illegal arms to Mexico, President Wilson ordered the Navy {{to stop the}} ship from docking {{at the port of}} Veracruz. On 21 April 1914, a naval brigade of marines and sailors occupied Veracruz. A total of 55 Medals of Honor were awarded for acts of heroism at Veracruz, the largest number ever granted for a single action.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of}} the situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{intelligence}} received through Ultra intercepts, the U.S. III Corps G-2 intelligence officer believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were assembling a large force {{to wipe out}} the bridgehead, but unknown to the Allies, <b>the</b> units <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> called on to push the Americans back were only [...] "impressive on paper." [...] None of <b>the</b> sizable <b>German</b> units defending <b>the</b> bridgehead were cohesive and many were severely understrength after being reduced during the Battle of the Bulge. From 10–13 March, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> forces included mostly the remains of 11 divisions.|$|R

5|$|According to some sources, 26 April {{marks the}} end of this battle, {{although}} less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of}} the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} also {{accounts}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were low on food themselves. Regardless, Stalag III-A remains an example of poor conduct {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> towards prisoners of war.|$|R
5|$|High {{figures for}} tanks lost {{during the battle}} have been widely {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of <b>the</b> battle stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.|$|R
25|$|In September 1944, Pavelić {{met with}} Hitler {{for the last}} time. Pavelić {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> stop arming and supplying Chetnik units, and asked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> disarm <b>the</b> Chetniks or allow the NDH to disarm them. Hitler agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chetniks could not be trusted, and issued orders to German forces to stop cooperating with the Chetniks and assist NDH authorities to disarm them. However, German commanders were given sufficient leeway {{that they were able}} to avoid carrying out the orders.|$|R
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and came to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct {{intelligence}} in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end {{agreed to participate in the}} Alsos Mission as a junior partner. In June 1945, Welsh reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans, and Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The house was bugged, and the conversations of the scientists were recorded.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans {{did not live}} in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E
