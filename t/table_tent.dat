5000|$|Some {{restaurants}} {{use only}} text in their menus. In other cases, restaurants include illustrations and photos, {{either of the}} dishes or of {{an element of the}} culture which is associated with the restaurant. An example of the latter is in cases where a Lebanese kebab restaurant decorates its menu with photos of Lebanese mountains and beaches. Particularly with the ancillary menu types, the menu may be provided in alternative formats, because these menus (other than wine lists) tend to be much shorter than food menus. For example, an appetizer menu or a dessert menu may be displayed on a folded paper <b>table</b> <b>tent,</b> a hard plastic table stand, a flipchart style wooden [...] "table stand," [...] or even, {{in the case of a}} pizza restaurant with a limited wine selection, a wine list glued to an empty bottle.|$|E
40|$|A {{hospital}} stay {{can be a}} trying and frightening event for patients and their families. As a result, it is often hard to devise effective means of communication for patients and visitors during an inpatient stay. This gap in effective communication leads to dissatisfaction and frustration from patients. To combat this, a simple new <b>table</b> <b>tent</b> card was created {{to be given to}} patients after a room cleaning as a pilot to answer commonly asked questions by patients, and updated scripting was created to assist environmental services staff as they delivered the new cards. The cards were distributed across two floors over six weeks and environmental services staff performed 80 patient interviews {{to assess the impact of}} the cards. Of those interviewed, 57 % remembered the card and 38 % read the card. Of those who read the card, 100 % were able to recall something from it. This retention rate is promising and offers insight as to how best connect with patients during inpatient stays. This study is relevant to public health due to its direct impact on patient experience in a hospital setting...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} four decades, American {{consumers}} have increased the frequency of dining out and, in recent years, have shown an increased interest in having nutrition information available at restaurants. In response to consumer interests {{as well as the}} growing obesity epidemic, restaurants, consumer interest groups, and the U. S. government have begun to take action. While other studies have addressed various aspects of nutrition information labeling in restaurants, none have concentrated on consumer response to nutrition information content delivery method within the context of proximity to the guest and resulting required search efforts to obtain the nutrition information. ^ As an exploratory study to establish the Health Conscious Spectrum, a quasi-experimental design was used to examine consumer attitude and behavior in response to nutrition information at four different levels of search effort. The author tested consumer desire for restaurant nutrition information labeling and proximity, and actual use of and effort spent to obtain the information in a full-service restaurant setting. As a result of the analysis, it was found that consumers with both great and little interest in nutrition content are more likely to see and use nutrition labeling information when it is presented either in the menu or in a <b>table</b> <b>tent.</b> Most consumers expressed preference for information available either in the menu or upon request, and would like to see calories and calories from fat listed. According to the results of this study, there were no statistically significant differences between perceived healthiness and having read the nutrition information, however some entrées were perceived to be healthier than others. This study provides valuable insights into characteristics of consumers that use nutrition information in restaurants, and how this information can be used to assist restaurateurs. ...|$|E

40|$|National surveys {{indicate}} that {{about one-third of}} the adult population in this country is unaware that they are expected to tip 15 to 20 percent of the bill in restaurants. Knowledge about the restaurant tipping norm is even lower for some groups of people (such as foreigners and ethnic minorities) and in some geographic regions. This represents a problem for restaurant managers because people who are unaware of the restaurant tipping norm generally tip less than those who are familiar with it and the small tips left by the former group can lower server morale, discourage servers from giving good service to those customers, and increase server turnover. To avoid or reduce these problems, restaurant mangers should educate their customers about appropriate tipping behavior, but must do so in a way that customers do not find irritating or threatening. To help managers accomplish this task, I have developed a short quiz about tipping that can be put on <b>table</b> <b>tents</b> or menu inserts. Questions designed to increase customers awareness of tipping norms and their importance are intermixed with other interesting and fun questions about tipping and the answers to all questions are provided. Thus, customers taking this quiz should learn about appropriate tipping behavior as natural consequence of having fun taking the quiz, checking their answers, and comparing their scores with others at the table...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{tremendous}} efforts {{placed on}} tobacco prevention and cessation efforts, smoking rates {{are on the}} rise among college students. Recent research suggests occasional smoking is not risk free and that occasional smokers can actually be addicted. Occasional smoking is a transition stage, either towards quitting or uptake, and represents an opportunity for education. Survey data were collected from a random sample of students at a northeastern university in 2002 (N= 937) regarding their perceptions of occasional versus regular smoking. While all groups believed the dangers of smoking were considerable and felt regular smokers were susceptible to these dangers, there was more disagreement among perceptions of occasional smoking. While there was general agreement among all groups that occasional smoking is bad for your health in the long term, there was less agreement that occasional smokers are susceptible to immediate negative consequences, a general belief that occasional smoking doesn't constitute “real” smoking and that it is easy to quit. Data were used to develop an occasional smoking print campaign (e. g., newspaper, <b>table</b> <b>tents,</b> posters). The campaign materials were refined and piloted in a series of focus groups before being launched in 2003. The campaign was evaluated in 2004 via another student survey (N= 1247). Results suggest significant changes in beliefs about occasional smoking being bad for health, that occasional smokers can quit anytime, and the benefits of not smoking occasionally. In addition, during and after the campaign, requests to the student health center for quit kits doubled compared to pre-campaign requests...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{interventions}} as {{labeling of}} healthy foods {{and an increased}} availability of healthy foods may help consumers to meet the guidelines for a healthy diet. This article describes a study into the effectiveness of two environmental programs {{to be used in}} worksite cafeterias along with an educational program. The aim of the interventions was to reduce fat intake and increase fruit and vegetable intake. In the 'Labeling Program', low fat products were labeled. The 'Food Supply Program' comprised an increased availability of low-fat products and fruits and vegetables in worksite cafeterias. The 'Educational Program' consisted of information about healthy nutrition through brochures, <b>table</b> <b>tents,</b> a self help manual and posters. The design consisted of a pretest-posttest experimental control group design, with four conditions: the Educational Program, the Food Supply Program plus Educational Program, the Labeling Program plus Educational Program and a control group. Seventeen worksites were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the four research conditions. Total fat, fruit, and vegetable intake was measured with a quantitative, self-administered food frequency questionnaire (35 questions). Intake during lunch was measured by asking respondents to write down which food items they had purchased during their last lunch in the cafeteria. Furthermore, sales data for some targeted product categories were collected (milk, butter, cheese, meat products, desserts). For the whole study population, no significant effects on consumption data were found for any of the programs. The data showed a beneficial significant treatment effect of the Labeling Program on total fat intake, for respondents who believe they eat a high fat diet. Sales data revealed a significant effect of the labeling program on desserts, but not for the other products...|$|R
