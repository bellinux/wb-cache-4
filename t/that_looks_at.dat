5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E

25|$|Because the National Basketball Association Draft {{takes place}} {{just three months}} after the NCAA tournament, NBA {{executives}} have to decide how players' performances in a maximum of seven games, from the First Four to the championship game, should affect their draft decisions.

For instance, Complexity: understanding value systems is a text <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> values through a positive interpretation, a negative interpretation, a paradoxical negative interpretation of the positive, and a paradoxical positive interpretation of the negative. Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|E

2500|$|A {{high-throughput}} study, which denotes technology <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> extensive genetic markers, {{focused on}} epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins to compare global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications {{in a sample}} of 40 monozygotic twin pairs. In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from this study was that there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”. Epigenetic drift is the term given to epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age. While age is a known risk factor for many diseases, age-related methylation ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the clip}} show [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", the entire setup of Troy McClure {{presenting}} the episode is {{a parody of}} the practice by live-action series to produce clip shows in general. The parody was done by celebrating a completely random milestone and by making exaggerated use of the conventions of traditional highlight shows, such as a grand introduction and relentlessly showbizzy host. Considered a spoof of television clip shows, the episode is seen drawing attention to prevailing televisual conventions and reminds viewers that The Simpsons itself participates actively in that same cultural legacy. Simone Knox referred to it in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons" [...] as not simply a clip show, [...] "but a ‘clip show’ <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the series {{with a sense of}} hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". Since [...] "Gump Roast", there has not been any more clip shows of The Simpsons. The show now instead produces episodes with three adaptations of existing stories for each act, called [...] "trilogy episodes", rendering a clip show unnecessary.|$|E

Deputy Mayor, Cllr Mc Kevitt said, ‘It {{is a great idea}} to give an issue that has an international perspective a local focus.

The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today.
