5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The tornado {{is known as the}} worst disaster in the history of Chappaqua.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months. Before this event there had been only six tornadoes ever recorded in the state during March, and since this event there has been only six. This outbreak also marks the first time in Minnesota history that two tornadoes were recorded on the same day in March, as well as the first time since 1921 that there have been multiple tornado fatalities on the same March day. Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes that touched on March 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b> Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely rather than <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> with precision {{on a particular}} spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
5|$|The tornadoes {{continued}} to track through central Alabama that afternoon {{and into the}} early evening hours. A dangerous and destructive tornado struck the city of Cullman, Alabama, at around 3:00p.m. CDT (2000 UTC). This large, multiple-vortex tornado was captured on several tower cameras from television stations such as Fox affiliate WBRC (channel 6) and ABC affiliate WBMA-LD/WCFT-TV/WJSU-TV (channels 58, 33, and 40) out of Birmingham. The tornado caused extensive destruction in downtown Cullman, a city of about 20,000 people; the tornado was ultimately rated an EF4. The final damage count was 867 residences and 94 businesses in Cullman, and 6 people were killed throughout the path. The town of Cordova, Alabama, which had already been damaged by an EF3 tornado from the initial round of storms, was struck by an EF4 tornado that killed 13 people. Two violent EF4 tornadoes also ripped through Jackson County, Alabama, one of which caused a fatality near Bridgeport, while the other passed near Pisgah and into Georgia where it caused major damage in Trenton, killing 14 people along its path. At around 5:10p.m. CDT (2210 UTC), a very large and exceptionally destructive tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and about 40 minutes later, the same tornado struck the northern suburbs of nearby Birmingham. A tornado emergency was issued for both cities, {{along with many other}} cities that day. Many local television stations, including WBRC and WBMA-LD/WCFT/WJSU, as well as CBS affiliate WIAT (channel 42), broadcast live footage of this long-tracked tornado in both Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. A debris ball was observed by the Birmingham NEXRAD, indicating that the tornado was causing extreme damage. This tornado killed 64 people and caused extensive devastation in densely populated areas, and the tornado struck several of the same small communities as the April 1956 F4, the April 1977 F5 and the April 1998 F5 tornadoes that hit portions of the Birmingham area. The supercell responsible for the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham EF4 tornado originated in Newton County, Mississippi. The supercell also produced an EF4 tornado later that evening that killed 22 people as it struck areas in and around Ohatchee, Alabama, before eventually crossing into Georgia and causing additional damage near Cave Spring before dissipating. Further to the south, a mile-wide EF3 tornado killed 7 people in mostly rural areas and caused major damage {{in the small town of}} Eoline. The final EF5 tornado of the day caused remarkable damage in and around the town of Rainsville, Alabama, killing 25 people before crossing into Georgia and dissipating. Tornadoes continued <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> further to the northeast as the sun set, particularly in Georgia. This included a long-tracked EF4 that caused major damage in Ringgold, Georgia, Apison, Tennessee, and Cleveland, Tennessee, killing 20 people along the path. After dark, violent tornadoes continued <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down,</b> and a nighttime EF4 tornado destroyed many lakeside homes at Lake Martin in eastern Alabama, killing seven people. Additional strong nighttime tornadoes occurred in Georgia, including an EF3 that killed two people in Barnesville, and another EF3 that destroyed multiple homes and killed one person at Lake Burton.|$|E

25|$|The LCAs for {{the initial}} assault wave were {{scheduled}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> at 02:45, which they managed, {{and in most cases}} at the correct beaches. At approximately 03:15, LCIs and LCTs moving the reserve companies and assaulting battalion's headquarters were <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b> Unfortunately, this wave was not so successful; a number of craft initially failed to locate their designated beaches, and, arriving 30 to 60 minutes late, delayed the division's movement inland. Soon after, at 03:45, the LCIs and LCTs of the brigade reserve follow-up flight were to be {{in the vicinity of the}} beaches ready to beach when opportunity afforded. All craft were to be beached by first light (04:39) or be in an unsinkable position by that time. To enable loading to be carried out after sunrise, 05:47, arrangements were made for ample smoke canisters to be carried in all craft, so that the area of the landing beaches could be adequately smoked should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore {{government}} held {{a public}} {{inquiry into the}} accident under Mr. Justice Knight from 31 May to 16 August. The accident was attributed to poor execution of the approach due to crew tiredness, which exacerbated the pilot's decision <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> {{near the end of}} the runway. The inquiry determined that, at the time of arrival in Singapore, Captain Hoyle had been on duty for 21Â½ hours since the flight departed Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Allied records report {{only two}} C.205Vs downed (Tenenti Andreoli and Fanelli), while another made an {{emergency}} landing near Cap Bon, and explains why some sources quote two losses and others three, {{but there is some}} doubt as to whether this aircraft, the only one <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> on African soil, was a Veltro or a Folgore. At least one other Macchi was damaged, and the pilot wounded. Similarly, the Italian claims did not match any losses recorded in Allied squadron reports.|$|E

25|$|Due to its location, Billings is {{susceptible}} to severe weather. In most cases, severe storms travel fast at 25 to 30 miles per hour. The first recorded tornado <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in Billings was on June 2, 1958. On June 20, 2010, a tornado dubbed the Father's Day Tornado touched down in the Billings Heights and Downtown sections of the city. The tornado was accompanied by hail up to golf ball size, dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning, and heavy winds. The tornado destroyed a number of businesses and severely damaged the 12,000-seat Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark.|$|E
25|$|The {{two sides}} agreed to permit cross-strait flights for the Chinese New Year of Rooster in 2005.

The first direct {{commercial}} flights from China (from Guangzhou) to Taiwan since 1949 arrived in Taipei on January 29, 2005. Shortly afterwards, a China Airlines carrier landed in Beijing. Airports on both sides saw ceremonial displays on {{the arrival of the}} first passengers, with dancing lions and dragons, and officials making speeches. For the three-week holiday period, 48 flights were scheduled.|$|E
50|$|Speed {{flying and}} Speed riding {{requires}} different wing sizes {{because of the}} different glide angles, and launch techniques. Speed flying requires a larger, slower wing for foot launches (between 13 and 18 square metres), while Speed riding involves a faster, smaller, ski-launched wing (between 8 and 14 square metres). This allows the pilot <b>to</b> periodically <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> and speed ride the slope on skis or a snowboard.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 8:50 pm (CST) on June 5, 2010 an EF2 tornado {{swept through}} southern Streator. The tornado initially <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> east of Magnolia, causing EF0 and EF1 damage as it traveled east. EF2 damage began as the tornado passed East 15th Road. No fatalities were reported, {{but there were}} reports of leveled houses and extensive damage throughout the area. The National Weather Service reported that there were two tornadoes. The second was reported <b>to</b> have <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> one mile west of Streator, with a base of 50 feet.|$|R
50|$|Since the SPC began {{keeping records}} of severe weather events in 1950, few tornadoes have <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> around New York City. Prior to the 2010 Bronx tornado, {{the most recent}} to hit the area were an EF1 and EF2 on August 8, 2007 which hit Brooklyn. In the Bronx, there has been only one other tornado {{confirmed}} <b>to</b> have <b>touched</b> <b>down,</b> the first was recorded on September 2, 1974. Four other tornadoes have been recorded within the city, one in each 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2003, none of which exceeded F1 intensity.|$|R
25|$|Two little islands off Utah Beach {{presented}} {{a potential threat}} to the invasion forces {{and became the first}} French territory liberated by seaborne Allied soldiers on D-Day.

From a navigation perspective this operation {{presented a}}cute challenges; locating two tiny islets in darkness while weaving through unmarked minefields <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> on rocky shores. These LCAs came from SS Empire Gauntlet, the landing ship whose LCAs also delivered the initial wave of the 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry, US 4th Division, the westernmost seaborne landing of D-Day.|$|E
25|$|As the Canadian {{city with}} {{the highest number of}} days {{including}} severe thunderstorms and lightning, Windsor has historically been subject to tornadic activity. The strongest and deadliest tornado <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in Windsor was an F4 in 1946. Windsor was the only Canadian city to experience a tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak, an F3 which killed nine people when it destroyed the Windsor Curling Club. The city was grazed by the 1997 Southeast Michigan tornado outbreak with one tornado (an F1) forming east of the city. Tornadoes have been recorded crossing the Detroit River (in 1946 and 1997), and waterspouts are regularly seen over Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie especially in autumn.|$|E
25|$|During {{the voyage}} back to Spain, PinzÃ³n's ship was {{separated}} from Columbus in stormy conditions, southwest of the Azores. PinzÃ³n arrived in Baiona in Galicia, near Vigo, 1 March 1493; Columbus reached Lisbon on March 4; he later faced problems with the Court for having touched down in Portugal out of necessity in bad weather. PinzÃ³n, despite the bad weather and strong southerly winds, had managed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> on Spanish territory, not Portuguese. Believing Columbus to be lost, he {{sent a letter to}} the King and Queen; some have argued that he claimed the glory of the great discoveries for himself, while others defend him from the charge; the letter itself is lost. It is not clear whether his letter or Columbus's from Lisbon reached court first, nor is it clear whether the failure to invite PinzÃ³n to court resulted from Columbus's primacy of position, possible accusations by Columbus against PinzÃ³n, or simply reports of PinzÃ³n's illness and death.|$|E

500|$|Having played {{association}} {{football at}} school, Williams switched to playing rugby with the Whitchurch Village rugby club. From {{the start of}} his career, he played on the left wing. In 1899, Williams was invited to play at Newport RFC under the newly appointed captain, Llewellyn Lloyd. Several players had departed, leaving gaps in the backline, and Williams was brought in, alongside Cliff Pritchard and W. Isaacs, while the effective pairing of Lloyd and Lou Phillips at halfback continued. In Williams' first season at Newport, the team scored a total of 416 points compared with the previous season's 192. The following season was Newport's third best on record. However, Williams was injured {{during the course of the}} year. Nevertheless, his contributions were noted: against Moseley, despite an early error, he scored a try in the first quarter [...] "after a grand run", and at the beginning of the second half, managed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> a second try, just before Yates [...] "grassed him".|$|E
5000|$|The corner flag, {{currently}} situated {{where the}} try line meets the touchline, will {{become part of}} the field of play. Under the current laws, a try is still allowed if a player touches the corner flag while attempting <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the ball <b>down.</b>|$|R
