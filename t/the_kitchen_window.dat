25|$|The kitchen set seen on The Golden Girls was {{originally}} used {{on an earlier}} Witt/Thomas/Harris series, It Takes Two, which aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. However, the exterior backdrop seen through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> changed from the view of Chicago high-rises to palm trees and bushes for the Miami setting.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{begins in}} 1992 with an elderly woman, Aliide Truu, {{who lives in}} a remote portion of Estonia. The woman had {{isolated}} herself from the surrounding society and watches the youth of her nation, including her daughter, leaving the countryside for the more urban regions and Finland. One day while looking out <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> she discovers Zara, the granddaughter of her sister Ingel. Zara had been forced to partake in the sex trade by the Russian Mafia but escaped them. The only guide she had to help her find help, was a photograph from her grandmother with Aliide's name on it. The story then continues with a series of flashbacks which develops the relationship of Aliide and her sister, which hinged upon their competition for the love of Hans Pekk during World War II. The story ends as Aliide begins to reconcile herself with her jealousy of her sister and Zara's redemption from her disenchantment with the world caused by her sexual subjugation.|$|E

500|$|In the film, [...] "Helen Reed" [...] {{sees the}} {{attacker}} before being shot. However, Katie Starks was {{shot through the}} same window as her husband and did not see her attacker until he tried crawling through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> Mrs. Starks {{ran out of the}} house, but was not chased. At the end of the film, the officers chase the Phantom and shoot him in the leg, but the real Phantom was never chased or shot at all.|$|E
500|$|Black {{travels to}} Garry's {{home with a}} deputy, Kevin Reilly (Steve Bacic). Daubed in blood on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> are the numbers [...] "1 28 15", which Reilly notes {{no one has been}} able to understand. Black also listens to a {{recording}} of Garry's confession, which details the murders meticulously. Black convinces Garry's attorney to allow him an interview, insisting he will be entirely impartial. Garry tells Black he had planned the murders for some time, motivated by hatred for his wife and monetary concerns. Black refutes this, pointing out that Garry had carved a wooden angel as a gift for his wife that same day, using the chisel that was the murder weapon. Smith, realizing that Black does not believe Garry to be guilty, dismisses him from the case.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) [...] and Pam (Jenna Fischer) are {{attempting}} to get bargain deals on wedding plans from Andy (Ed Helms). When Pam turns down his ideas, Andy suspects that Pam might be acting controlling and cruelly to Jim, {{in the same way}} Angela (Angela Kinsey) treated Andy. Andy warns Jim, who tries to convince Andy that he and Pam are really happy. Andy remains convinced that Pam will betray him, so Jim asks Andy to provide for his emotional needs (as a prank). After Jim feigns crying on Andy's shoulder, Andy blames the office for Jim's emotional troubles and asks them to apologize. Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) tells Andy that Jim is just messing with him. Andy does not believe her until he sees Jim grinning through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> When Andy confronts Jim, Jim assures him that he and Pam are really happy and that Andy will find someone else one day.|$|E

50|$|Some {{windows to}} the coach house complex are now missing, those extant include a {{combination}} of double hung timber framed windows to the boarding house and timber framed fixed and casement <b>windows</b> to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>Windows</b> to <b>the</b> northern, western and eastern elevations of the boarding house are protected from the weather by timber framed awnings sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{visitors}} fleeing through the courtyard were saved by the cook and manageress of the Hôtel du Palais, M. Gauméry and Mme Roche-Sautier (respectively), who helped them escape the fire through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> to <b>the</b> adjoining building. [...] The identification of charred remains {{by the use of}} dental records was a landmark in the early history of forensic dentistry.|$|R
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

60|$|The {{very first}} day she shut <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door in <b>the</b> face of the tom-cats who used to enjoy {{watching}} Lizina at her work, and a young and mischievous cat who jumped in by <b>the</b> open <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> and alighted on the table got such a blow with the rolling-pin that he squalled for an hour.|$|R
60|$|I {{have many}} a time strolled sorrowfully along, with a sad heart {{and an empty}} stomach, about five o'clock, and looked wistfully down the areas in {{the west end of}} the town; and seen through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> <b>the</b> fires gleaming, and the joints of meat turning on the spits and {{dripping}} with gravy; and the cook maids beating up puddings, or trussing turkeys, and have felt for the moment that if I could but have the run of one of those <b>kitchens,</b> Apollo and <b>the</b> muses might have the hungry heights of Parnassus for me. Oh, sir! talk of meditations among the tombs--they are nothing so melancholy as the meditations of a poor devil without penny in pouch, along a line of <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> towards dinner-time.|$|R
60|$|Salome {{looked out}} of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> and a pucker of {{distress}} appeared on her smooth forehead.|$|E
60|$|AND Mr. McGregor {{was very}} angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> and hit the {{youngest}} Flopsy Bunny.|$|E
60|$|And, best of all, Will {{caught a}} glirnpse of a smiling girl face at <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> {{that made the}} blood beat in his throat.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{will show}} you up to him at once, Mr. Leander, for he will be very happy to see you. We have been {{thinking}} of hearing of you,' she added, talking as she ushered her guest up the narrow staircase. 'The good papa has a little cold: 'tis not much, I hope; caught at Sir Wallinger's, a large dinner; they would have <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> open, which spoilt all the entrées, and papa got a cold; but I think, perhaps, it is as much vexation as anything else, you know if anything goes wrong, especially with the entrées------' ...|$|R
50|$|The service wing {{comprises}} {{an enclosed}} eastern verandah, a kitchen and large pantry with timber shelves, a living space, and a laundry. The laundry is {{at ground level}} with a rear door into the yard and a small timber stair up to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> laundry <b>windows</b> are corrugated metal, top-hung shutters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mike," [...] said Seraphina to her brother, {{who was now}} raking {{the grass}} near <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> [...] "did you hear dat ar ole cook a talkin' jes' now?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She be there, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} miller, {{pointing}} towards <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> with his head. So Mrs. Fenwick lifted the latch and entered. The parson sat himself {{down by the}} miller's side.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked out}} under the trees to the brook-side and stood {{listening}} to the tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond. The light faded early on these September evenings, and the smoky mist had begun {{to rise from the}} water when they turned back again. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> were already growing yellow, and through them the faithful Millicent could be seen bustling about in her preparations for supper. But Cynthia, having accomplished her errand, would not go in. She could not have borne to have any one drive back with her to Brampton then, and she must not be late upon the road.|$|R
60|$|Chapeau {{had already}} dived into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> through <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and had learnt {{that at any}} rate the {{republicans}} had as yet shed no blood.|$|R
60|$|I was fortunate, {{during my}} stay, in having {{experience}} of every variety of weather--from a dead calm {{to a regular}} gale. It was {{towards the end of}} my visit that the gale came on, and it lasted two days. No language can convey an adequate idea of the sublimity of the scene and the sense of power in the seething waves that waged furious war over the Rock during the height of that gale. The spray rose above <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> (70 feet on the tower), in such solid masses as to darken the room in passing, and twice during the storm we were struck by waves with such force as to shake the tower to its foundation.|$|R
60|$|I {{had seen}} him through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> and now I rushed out with my half-eaten bannock in my hand to greet him. He ran forward too, with his great hand out and his eyes shining.|$|E
60|$|Luckily she did {{not have}} to go to the length of actual housebreaking. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> went up quite easily. Rilla lifted Jims in and {{scrambled}} through herself, just as the storm broke in good earnest.|$|E
60|$|This belief was {{strengthened}} when {{he heard}} a noise as if <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> was being raised, and he leaped out of bed, vexed with himself because he had not gone down sooner to build the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ye wouldna hae heard,' he said, 'wha got the muckle airm-chair 'at {{used to sit}} i' <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> i' <b>the</b> <b>window</b> 'at looks ower the brae?' ...|$|R
60|$|Dick {{broke into}} a run, with Tom at his heels. Entering the garden by a rear gate, they soon reached the {{vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> A <b>window</b> stood wide open, and through this they beheld somebody inside the apartment with a blazing match in his hand trying to light a candle.|$|R
60|$|Then {{his mind}} {{flew back to}} Agnes. Would she see it? She was at work, getting breakfast, but he hoped she had time to see it. He was in that mood so common to him now, when he could not fully enjoy any sight or sound unless he could share it with her. Far down the road he heard the sharp clatter of a wagon. The roosters were calling near and far, in many keys and tunes. The dogs were barking, cattle bells jangling in the wooded pastures, and as the youth passed farmhouses, lights in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> showed that <b>the</b> women were astir about breakfast, {{and the sound of}} voices and curry-combs at the barn told that the men were at their daily chores.|$|R
