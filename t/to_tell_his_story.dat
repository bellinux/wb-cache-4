5|$|The first Halloween comic was {{published}} by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled Halloween, {{it was intended to}} be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20. These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to Halloween H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> in comic book form.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel is}} written {{in the third person}} omniscient point of view. In this novel, the author uses many voices <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story,</b> {{including}} main characters Marek, Kate, and Chris. The author uses the voices of minor characters as well, such as the couple who finds a confused man wandering in the desert, and a cop who cannot accept the story of an old man who simply wandered away from his own car in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Nine – The Mock Turtle's Story: The Duchess {{is brought}} to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in {{everything}} around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her {{with the threat of}} execution and she introduces Alice to the Gryphon, who takes her to the Mock Turtle.

25|$|In 1905, Geronimo agreed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had {{to appeal}} to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing {{exactly what he wanted}} to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 Rosenblat and {{his wife}} had run into serious {{financial}} problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him. According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it.|$|E
25|$|On the January 20 {{episode of}} Raw, Eric Bischoff made an {{announcement}} about how Stone Cold Steve Austin {{walked out on}} Vince McMahon {{during the summer of}} 2002 with no explanation and {{that he would like to}} give Steve Austin an opportunity to give his side of the story. Bischoff also invited Steve Austin to make an appearance at next month's No Way Out. The following week, Bischoff stated that Austin has agreed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> in the Raw magazine. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Bischoff headed to Texas, to sign Austin to the Raw brand. But, he was unsuccessful in doing so, as he couldn't locate Austin anywhere. The following week on Raw, Bischoff (kayfabe) fired Jim Ross, after Bischoff stated that it was Ross' fault that Austin hasn't signed yet to the brand. Vince McMahon, who the previous week stated he would fire Bischoff and Chief Morley for the way they were running Raw the last couple of weeks, asked Bischoff if he'd signed Austin yet, which prompted Bischoff to say No. J.R. informed McMahon that Austin would be at No Way Out, which led to McMahon booking a match between Bischoff and Austin for the pay-per-view.|$|E

Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), at this point working with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, believes that the man may have had some connection to his father, Bill. Mulder discovers that Skur {{was reported to have}} died in 1952. He seeks out Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), a retired FBI agent who investigated Skur in the 1950s. At first, Dales is reluctant to discuss the case and warns Mulder away. However, Mulder's threat of a subpoena persuades Dales <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Night is {{the account of}} the 15-year-old Eliezer, a [...] "semi-fictional construct", told by the 25-year-old Elie Wiesel. This allows the 15-year-old <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> from [...] "the post-Holocaust vantage point" [...] of Night's readers. In a {{comparative}} analysis of the Yiddish and French texts, Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish culture, concludes that there are two survivors in Wiesel's writing, a Yiddish and French. In re-writing rather than simply translating Un di Velt Hot Geshvign, Wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards [...] "testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews," [...] with one [...] "haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God..." [...] Night transformed the Holocaust into a religious event.|$|E

500|$|When Scott {{unexpectedly}} {{married in}} 1969, {{it appeared that}} the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended; Scott convinced himself that Thorpe was to blame. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of Talybont, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to Emlyn Hooson, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party enquiry which cleared Thorpe and left Scott feeling bitter and humiliated. After Parry-Jones's death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, however, he began <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> to anyone who would listen. [...] By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, was terrified of exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As Dominic Sandbrook observes in his history of the times: [...] "The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had never been more urgent".|$|E
500|$|Famitsu reviewers {{noted the}} level of detail from the game's direction, {{accessibility}} and wit of the story, unconventional art style, and conventional game mechanics. They considered the timed battles to be both useful and difficult. Eurogamer Simon Parkin detailed the 12-year development, the series' legacy as both [...] "one of Japan's most beloved" [...] and the video game cognoscenti's [...] "sacred cow", and the endurance of its fan community. He {{was impressed by the}} quality of the fan translation, and described Itoi as a [...] "storyteller" [...] who chose the Japanese role-playing game medium <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b> Parkin noted how the [...] "excellent" [...] script unfurled from a [...] "straightforward tale" [...] into [...] "breadth and depth of quality that few titles many times its budget achieve" [...] with [...] "affecting scenes" [...] and [...] "unexpected impact". He compared the chapter approach with the method of Dragon Quest IV. Parkin wrote that the script allowed for the somewhat [...] "heavy-handed" [...] juxtaposition of [...] "nature and technology, feudalism and capitalism, individuals and community", and that what he first considers a name customization [...] "trick" [...] becomes useful later in the game. NGC Magazine Mark Green wrote that the game felt like Mother 2.5 in its look and feel, which he did not consider negative, albeit somewhat antiquated. Lada of TechnologyTell said Mother 3 was surprisingly [...] "darker" [...] than its forebears.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{described}} specific {{visual cues}} in the screenplay, {{such as in}} Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession {{that he had not}} moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b> As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written. To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15–20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one. So the credits could present the film as [...] "a true story" [...] rather than as [...] "based on" [...] one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene. Straczynski believed the only research error he made was in a scene that referenced Scrabble, pre-dating its appearance on the market by two years. He changed the reference to a crossword puzzle. He did not alter the shooting script any further from his first draft; though Straczynski had written two more drafts for Howard, Eastwood insisted the first draft be filmed as he felt it had the clearest voice of the three. Straczynski said, [...] "Clint's funny—if he likes it, he'll do it, that's the end of the discussion. When I met with him to ask, 'Do you want any changes, do you want any things cut, added to, subtracted from, whatever', he said, 'No. The draft is fine. Let's shoot the draft.|$|E
