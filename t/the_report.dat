This trend is particularly present among Iranian, Saudi-Arabian, and American cultures. However, American managerial styles cannot simply be transplanted to other cultures; participatory management styles must be adapted to each culture's beliefs system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This is {{the first}} of two surveys of <b>the</b> World Development <b>Report</b> series. Here we focus on the discursive {{strategies}} adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Reports.</b> We begin by setting <b>the</b> <b>Reports</b> within <b>the</b> wider milieu of development theory and practice. Behind the pragmatic, problem-solving image that <b>the</b> <b>Reports</b> aim to promote we identify a narrow and pre-framed position that eschews radical or alternative agendas. <b>The</b> <b>Reports</b> engage in numerous discursive ploys to undermine, ignore or manipulate other positions and establish <b>the</b> <b>Reports</b> (and, by extension, the World Bank) as the repository of development ‘common sense’. While <b>the</b> <b>Reports</b> are impressive syn-thesizing documents, they have lost their ability to play a truly leading role in thinking about development because of their failure to debate alternative positions or fully acknowledge the mistakes of the past...|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, <b>the</b> <b>report</b> assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). <b>The</b> <b>report</b> also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>report</b> concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E
