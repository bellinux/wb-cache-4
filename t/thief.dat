5|$|<b>Thief</b> II {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, and its initial sales were stronger {{than those of}} its predecessor. However, the game's royalties were processed slowly, which compounded Looking Glass's financial troubles. As a result, the company closed in May 2000, with plans for <b>Thief</b> III cancelled. The third game in the series, entitled , was developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos in 2004. <b>Thief</b> 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age, a widely praised expansion mod for <b>Thief</b> II, was released in 2005. In 2013, Eidos Montréal announced a reboot of the series (<b>Thief),</b> and it was released the following year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thief</b> II was {{designed}} {{to build on the}} foundation of its predecessor. In response to feedback from players of <b>Thief,</b> the team placed a heavy focus on urban stealth in the sequel, and they minimized the use of monsters and maze-like levels. The game was made with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously to develop <b>Thief</b> and System Shock 2. <b>Thief</b> II was announced at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, as part of an extended contract between Looking Glass and Eidos to release games in the <b>Thief</b> series. Looking Glass neared bankruptcy as the game was developed, and the company was kept running by advances from Eidos.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and {{did not know what to}} think of The Orchid <b>Thief.</b> Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid <b>Thief,</b> its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid <b>Thief</b> into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid <b>Thief.</b>|$|E

5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler, The <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E
