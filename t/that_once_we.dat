500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Sednaoui. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took {{inspiration}} from Nobuyoshi Araki's work, {{and tried to}} convey a similar aesthetic to the photoshoot. The cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions. The lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. In order to create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed himself in a black body suit so he couldn't {{be seen in the}} final shot. However, Minogue remarked that [...] "the shoot was so very difficult but we knew <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> got it right it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, a {{news conference}} {{was held in the}} grand showroom. Giles {{emphasized}} the importance of the route as an indication of the future, both for civil and military aircraft. He warned: [...] "Now that we have proved that we can do it, we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it". LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B-29 was capable of flying 6,500 miles nonstop. He said, [...] "When we took off at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it. However, all our information indicated <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> passed Fairbanks it would drop. We didn't need a tailwind. All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule. The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph" [...] (110km/h). After the reporters were finished, Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight, including parachutes. They were offered free rides home on military aircraft. Potts refused the parachute and the ride, telling Giles, [...] "Thank you, general, I think I'll take the train!" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, Ishihara stated that Gold and Silver started development right after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime's [...] Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with Pokémon Stadium and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate {{was taken over by}} Pokémon Yellow. Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> entered the twenty-first century, it would be time for me to do something else entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E

2500|$|English captain Mike Brearley {{attributed}} his team's {{success to}} {{its ability to}} get through the Australian batting order. [...] "The biggest problem is to break the opening pair. Rick Darling and Graeme Wood", he said. [...] "At times they have played very well, but we have found <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> can get one of them cheaply {{we have been able to}} dismiss numbers three, four and five with the new ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon [...] "Skills" [...] Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest {{friends and}} another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it. They need to write me in more!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{suggests that the}} nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and {{that the rate of}} adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect. According to the 2014 Miller's Anesthesia book, [...] "when compared with placebo, acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain". A 2012 meta-analysis conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found [...] "relatively modest" [...] efficiency of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it [...] "is more than a placebo" [...] and a reasonable referral option. Commenting on this meta-analysis, both Edzard Ernst and David Colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance. Edzard Ernst later stated that [...] "I fear <b>that,</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> manage to eliminate this bias [...] … we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response." ...|$|E

We wanted to try to control the things that we could control. We felt like Kansas and here (Charlotte) were playing to our strengths; and just see where it fell after <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> get to the next round. So I’m really proud of everybody at SHR. I’m really proud of all my guys on this team. I just can’t thank everybody enough.” [...] "I'm really proud of that finish, really proud of that effort," [...] Gordon said. [...] " ... Kevin was tough. I knew he was going to be tough once he got out there." ...|$|E

6000|$|My convict {{never looked}} at me, except <b>that</b> <b>once.</b> While <b>we</b> stood in the hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures.

60|$|How {{this all}} is, {{and what are}} the laws of the {{relation}} between life and death, the living and the dead, I don't know. But that this relation exists, and exists in a manner as I describe it, for my own part I know. And I am fully aware <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> direct our living attention this way, instead of to the absurdity of the atom, then we have a whole living universe of knowledge before us. The universe of life and death, of which we, whose business it is to live and to die, know nothing. Whilst concerning the universe of Force and Matter we pile up theories and make staggering and disastrous discoveries of machinery and poison-gas, all of which we were much better without.|$|E
60|$|Poor Miss Tita had got up, discountenanced and helpless, and as {{we stood}} there before her aunt it would {{certainly}} have seemed to a spectator of the scene that the old woman was amusing herself at our expense. Miss Tita protested, in a confusion of exclamations and murmurs; but I lost no time in saying that if she would do me the honor to accept the hospitality of my boat I would engage that she should not be bored. Or {{if she did not}} want so much of my company the boat itself, with the gondolier, was at her service; he was a capital oar and she might have every confidence. Miss Tita, without definitely answering this speech, looked away from me, out of the window, as if she were going to cry; and I remarked <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> had Miss Bordereau's approval we could easily come to an understanding. We would take an hour, whichever she liked, one of the very next days. As I made my obeisance to the old lady I asked her if she would kindly permit me to see her again.|$|E

And against Dragut {{there was}} the whole navy of Genoa, whilst against us there is but one single galleon. By the Koran, if she shows fight, have we no teeth? Will it be the first galleon whose decks we have overrun? But if ye prefer a coward's counsel, ye sons of shame, {{consider}} <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> take the open sea our discovery will be assured, and Larocque hath told you that she carries twenty guns. I tell you {{that if we are}} to be attacked by her, best be attacked at close quarters, and I tell you that if we lie close and snug in here it is long odds that we shall never be attacked at all. That she has no inkling of our presence is proven, since she has cast anchor round the headland. And consider that if we fly from a danger that doth not exist, and in our flight are so fortunate as not to render real that danger and to court it, we abandon a rich argosy that shall bring profit to us all." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had gained}} her house I met her, as I supposed, coming toward {{me across the}} down, {{greeting}} me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge; and as {{it was late in}} the autumn and the esplanade was a blank I was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass. My enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment, for it had taken me but a few seconds to perceive that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend. I felt a shock much greater than any I should have thought possible as on this person's drawing near I identified her as poor little Flora Saunt. At what moment Flora had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which, it quickly came home to me, one would never linger again: I could intensely reflect <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> were face to face it chiefly mattered that I should succeed in looking still more intensely unastonished. All I saw at first was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses, over which something convex and grotesque, like the eyes of a large insect, something that now represented her whole personality, seemed, as out of the orifice of a prison, to strain forward and press. The face had shrunk away: it looked smaller, appeared even to look plain; it was at all events, so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned, wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight. There was no smile in it, and she made no motion to take my offered hand.|$|E
6000|$|His sympathies, too, were wonderfully varied. In {{everything}} {{connected with}} the stage, for instance, he was always extremely interested, and strongly upheld the necessity for archaeological accuracy in costume and scene-painting. 'In art,' he says {{in one of his}} essays, 'whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well'; and he points out <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> allow the intrusion of anachronisms, it becomes difficult to say where the line is to be drawn. In literature, again, like Lord Beaconsfield on a famous occasion, he was 'on the side of the angels.' He {{was one of the first}} to admire Keats and Shelley--'the tremulously-sensitive and poetical Shelley,' as he calls him. His admiration for Wordsworth was sincere and profound. He thoroughly appreciated William Blake. One of the best copies of the 'Songs of Innocence and Experience' that is now in existence was wrought specially for him. He loved Alain Chartier, and Ronsard, and the Elizabethan dramatists, and Chaucer and Chapman, and Petrarch. And to him all the arts were one. 'Our critics,' he remarks with much wisdom, 'seem hardly aware of the identity of the primal seeds of poetry and painting, nor that any true advancement in the serious study of one art co- generates a proportionate perfection in the other'; and he says elsewhere that if a man who does not admire Michael Angelo talks of his love for Milton, he is deceiving either himself or his listeners. To his fellow-contributors in the London Magazine he was always most generous, and praises Barry Cornwall, Allan Cunningham, Hazlitt, Elton, and Leigh Hunt without anything of the malice of a friend. Some of his sketches of Charles Lamb are admirable in their way, and, with the art of the true comedian, borrow their style from their subject:- ...|$|E
