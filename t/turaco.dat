Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species, of which 26 are endemic to the Albertine Rift; endemic species include the Ruwenzori <b>turaco</b> and handsome francolin. Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, features savanna birds such as the black-headed gonolek and those associated with swamps and lakes, including storks and cranes.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and <b>turaco</b> are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin, being copper-based pigments, require large {{quantities}} of copper {{in order to be}} manufactured. As turacos are primarily arboreal species, they are able to accumulate copper through a diet rich in fruits, flowers, buds, and other plant matter. Church and Moreau estimated that 3 months' worth of fruit intake contribute to producing the pigment present in the newly grown plumage of the <b>turaco</b> species T. corythaix (the Knysna <b>turaco).</b> It has also been observed that it takes young turacos around a year to acquire their colorful adult plumage, and some authors have speculated that they probably need that long to acquire the necessary copper. It has also been noted that turacos all live across Central Africa, which corresponds geographically with one of the world's richest copperbelts. It is unknown whether <b>turaco</b> diets are especially rich in copper as compared to the diets of other birds, or whether turacos are especially effective at extracting copper from their foods. It is also unknown whether <b>turaco</b> species lacking turacin and turacoverdin-induced pigmentation have a comparatively copper-deficient diet, absorb less copper from their diet, or lack the enzymes required to synthesize the pigments.|$|E
50|$|The Otidimorphae are a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the orders Cuculiformes (cuckoos), Musophagiformes (<b>turacos),</b> and Otidiformes (bustards) identified in 2014 by genome analysis. While the bustards seem {{to be related to}} the <b>turacos,</b> other genetic studies have found the cuckoos to be more related to bustards than either group of them is to <b>turacos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>turacos</b> make up {{the bird}} family Musophagidae (literally [...] "banana-eaters"), which {{includes}} plantain-eaters and go-away-birds. In southern Africa both <b>turacos</b> and go-away-birds {{are commonly known as}} loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous - the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the <b>turacos</b> are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.|$|R
25|$|Other authors {{speculate}} that <b>turacos</b> and other birds employing {{the use of}} turacoverdin may derive a physiological and biochemical benefit from synthesizing the pigment. Copper, like porphyrins, can be damaging to birds when accumulated at high concentrations. <b>Turacos</b> may detoxify {{the high levels of}} copper ingested in a diet rich with porphyrins, thereby advertising the protection they've granted themselves by depositing the copper-rich pigments in their feathers. It also may be of some biological significance that <b>turacos</b> all seem to be pigmented with turacin and turacoverdin in exactly the same regions of the wing feathers.|$|R
25|$|Turacin and turacoverdin {{are both}} found {{in four of}} the six genera of turacos. The {{subfamily}} Criniferinae is typically regarded as being devoid of the brighter pigments, although the genus Corythaeola does have a small stripe of turacoverdin on its breast. The remaining <b>turaco</b> genera are placed in the subfamily Musophaginae and are referred to as the turacin-bearing turacos. More than half of <b>turaco</b> species belong to the genus Tauraco, and are all notable for being mostly a vivid green.|$|E
25|$|Few studies {{into the}} {{chemical}} nature of turacoverdin {{have been performed}} to date. Research by R.E. Moreau in the 1950s showed it to be less soluble in basic solutions than its chemical cousin turacin. While originally thought to contain little copper by its discoverer, who instead believed it to be iron-based, later spectroscopic analysis demonstrated high copper (and low iron) content in pigment from the green feathers of the Knysna <b>turaco</b> and the Schalow's <b>turaco.</b> Moreau also demonstrated that the green coloration of turacos might actually {{be due to the}} combined effect of two different turacoverdin pigments that differ slightly in polarity.|$|E

25|$|Although {{no formal}} tests have been {{performed}} investigating the functional significance of turacoverdin coloration, speculation abounds. Moreau in 1958 observed that <b>turaco</b> species inhabiting forests {{are more likely to}} be green in color than species inhabiting other environments, which may offer concealment from predators. In fact, it has been observed that the greener and denser a turaco's forest habitat, the deeper green its plumage, while non-forest-dwelling <b>turaco</b> species tend to be devoid of the green pigment. This claim has not been studied rigorously from a biochemical or phylogenetic perspective, however, and awaits further research. Turacos may employ their unique green coloration for sexual or social advertisement, but again no spectrophotometric or biochemical studies have been conducted to test for sex differences in coloration, and to limited human perception there appears to be none.|$|E

25|$|Turacoverdin is {{a unique}} copper uroporphyrin pigment {{responsible}} for the bright green coloration of several birds of the family Musophagidae, most notably the <b>turaco.</b> It is chemically related to turacin, a red pigment also found almost exclusively in turacos. Turacoverdin {{is one of the}} only true green pigments found in birds, as the coloration that appears in most green feathers is due to the unique properties of blue structural coloration in combination with yellow carotenoids. Turacoverdin and turacin were the first ever chemically characterized feather pigments, and turacoverdin was first isolated and described in 1882 by Dr. C.F.W. Krukenberg.|$|E

25|$|Based {{upon the}} real Ituri Forest in Africa, this exhibit opened in 1999 and houses {{different}} animal species from the rainforests of central Africa. The exhibit {{begins with a}} forested exhibit for okapi then winds past a recreation of two leaf-covered Mbuti huts with signage about the people's customs and traditions. Next, the path leads to the hippopotamus exhibit, which also houses tilapia and has an underwater viewing area. After the hippos, the path passes through a bunch of bamboo before reaching a clearing where aviaries have housed great blue <b>turaco,</b> emerald starlings, tambourine doves, and Congo peafowl. A thatched-roof gift shop and a food stand are located in a plaza near by. Immediately to the right is the African forest buffalo exhibit, which also houses De Brazza's monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Schmidt's spot-nosed guenon, and spotted-necked otters. The plaza leads to a bridge flanked by the buffalo exhibit {{on one side and}} an exhibit that only the small monkeys and otters can access on the other. Across the bridge is a creek where the otters can swim, with viewing both above and below the water's surface. Afterwards, the path joins the rest of the zoo.|$|E

It is therefore not surprising that much attention has been paid to the germination potential of seeds ingested by frugivorous animals. Consequently the aim of this study was to determine what effect ingestion of seeds by Knysna <b>Turacos</b> (Tauraco corythaix) has on the germination rate and germination percentage of indigenous South African tree species. Fruits from twelve tree species were fed to the <b>Turacos</b> in separate trials and seed retention times were determined as it has been suggested that a longer seed retention time may increase germination rates. At the end of each trial, seeds were extracted from excreta of individual birds and planted in trays containing potting soil. Germination was recorded daily until 14 days of no germination. Knysna <b>Turacos</b> seed retention times were in the range of those obtained by other studies, with Ficus sur seeds having the fastest retention times (12. 4 ± 0. 8 min) and Celtis africana the slowest (34. 6 ± 5. 6 min). Seed ingestion by Knysna <b>Turacos</b> did not influence the rate at which seeds germinated in 83 % of the tree species, but ingested Ficus lutea and Ficus natalensis seeds germinated significantly sooner than whole fruit seeds.
