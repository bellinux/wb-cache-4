5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the episode was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by Peterson and Souders. Due to the {{important}} nature of the episode, Septien, Meyer, Peterson, and Souders began working on the script before Christmas, in the fall of 2010 after the writers had a general idea for the {{first part of}} the 10th season episodes. Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart palpitations due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.|$|E

5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} {{his own money}} into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E

50|$|Another {{version of}} the song, sung by Murtuza Khan, Qadir Khan and Chinmayee was also recorded. However, it was not officially {{released}} or featured in the movie as a complete song. This version was initiated and developed by Rahman, but had <b>to</b> <b>redone</b> again in Rahman's voice because Director Mani Ratnam thought Khan Brother's voice was not suitable for male lead of the movie Abhishek Bachchan. However Rahman used some of the Khan Brother's rendition in the song.|$|R
25|$|In 1961, Lorenz {{was running}} a {{numerical}} computer model <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> a weather prediction {{from the middle of}} the previous run as a shortcut.

25|$|Multics {{introduced}} many innovations, but {{had many}} problems. Frustrated {{by the size}} and complexity of Multics but not by the aims, Bell Labs slowly {{pulled out of the}} project.

25|$|The Dunderland Line {{was bought}} by the state for 2.5 million Norwegian krone in 1947. The {{construction}} work on the Nordland Line was of poor quality, resulting in low operating speeds.

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that after the PGD, there are more embryos {{suitable}} for transferring back to the woman than necessary. For the couples undergoing PGD, those embryos are very valuable, as the couple's current cycle may not lead to an ongoing pregnancy. Embryo cryopreservation and later thawing and replacement can give them {{a second chance to}} pregnancy without having <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> the cumbersome and expensive ART and PGD procedures.|$|E
25|$|Three {{different}} proposals {{fell through}} before Cleveland-based Forest City Enterprises {{was able to}} make the financial numbers work. FCE announced a deal with the City of Dallas in June 2005 to receive US$60.5 million from the city <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> the building. The main tower was converted to 225 apartments with ground floor retail. The three additions, not considered historically significant, were demolished. The modernist curtain wall on the base was removed, revealing its original exterior and balconies were added to the east façade, although most of the interior design elements were lost during years of renovation.|$|E

50|$|As in the NES original, the game's plot {{centers around}} Jason Frudnick, {{a young man}} who descends into a {{subterranean}} world to rescue a frog creature named Fred. Players control Jason {{behind the wheel of a}} tank vehicle called SOPHIA, exploring large environments and defeating various mutant enemies. Jason can also exit the tank to explore various areas into which the tank cannot venture. In addition <b>to</b> <b>redone</b> graphics and sound, Blaster Master Zero also adds various tweaks and features not seen in the NES game.|$|R
25|$|In 1607, Cobergher {{was ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> {{a bastion of}} the Catholic Counter Reformation: the whole city of Scherpenheuvel, in Brabant, was to be {{redesigned}} as an allegoric homage to the Mother of God, with a layout based on a 7-pointed star. His first designs for the basilica date from 1606. This pilgrimage church would become his masterpiece. The construction began in 1609 and lasted until about 1624, with the belfry remaining unfinished. The space under the dome is equally heptagonal. This basilica is the first important church with a central dome in the Southern Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Ledoux, who was {{eventually}} released, ceased building {{and attempted to}} prepare {{the publication of his}} complete œuvre. Since 1773, he had started to engrave his constructions and his projects but, because of the evolution of his style, he did not cease retouching his drawings, and the engravers constantly had <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> their boards. Ledoux evolved towards an architecture always more detailed and colossal, with vast walls that were increasingly smooth, and with increasingly rare openings. The differences between a drawing of the Pavillon de Louveciennes as it first was, made by the British architect Sir William Chambers and the engraving that was published in 1804 illustrate this process.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a parent, William Capacchione, {{sued the}} school system when his {{daughter}} was denied entrance into a magnet school {{for the second time}} based on her race. While {{the school system}} opposed the end of busing, Judge Robert D. Potter declared the mandate of a unitary system had been met and lifted the court order on mandatory busing by race or ethnicity. This ruling was upheld by the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia in 2000 and after the final appeal was declined to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal order of busing was ended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it was left {{in the hands of the}} city school board to decide how <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> the assignment policy for school attendance.|$|E

50|$|While budget {{became much}} less of an issue, {{overseas}} production houses would be chosen on a per-episode—or even per-scene—basis depending {{on the amount of}} money that was available at the moment. This resulted in obviously different levels of quality from episode to episode. This was particularly noticeable in shows like Gargoyles and Batman: The Animated Series, where at times characters would appear wildly off-model, requiring scenes <b>to</b> be <b>redone</b> <b>to</b> the dismay of their directors.|$|R

25|$|Katō {{reportedly}} did not {{get along}} well with his parents, and seldom returned home. An interview with Katō's brother revealed that his parents had put immense pressure on both of them to perform and to excel in their studies, ordering them <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> their homework to high standards in order to impress teachers in school, and recalled one incident when Katō was made to eat scraps of food from the floor. Another neighbour described Katō being punished by his parents, who made him stand outside for hours in deep, cold snow during winter. Previous online postings before his announcement of the attack contained sharp criticisms of his own upbringing. Deeply in debt and believing that his family {{had given up on}} him, Katō unsuccessfully attempted suicide in 2006 by ramming his car into a wall.|$|E
25|$|Utah {{finds the}} {{location}} of the next ordeal: solo rock climbing with no safety beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{drawbacks}} to this approach, due to {{the stage}} at which it is performed. First, only {{approximately half of the}} preimplantation embryos reach the blastocyst stage. This can restrict the number of blastocysts available for biopsy, limiting in some cases the success of the PGD. Mc Arthur and coworkers report that 21% of the started PGD cycles had no embryo suitable for TE biopsy. This figure is approximately four times higher than the average presented by the ESHRE PGD consortium data, where PB and cleavage-stage biopsy are the predominant reported methods. On the other hand, delaying the biopsy to this late stage of development limits the time to perform the genetic diagnosis, making it difficult <b>to</b> <b>redo</b> a second round of PCR or to rehybridize FISH probes before the embryos should be transferred back to the patient.|$|E

30|$|This theme {{demonstrates}} how the students redid an assignment {{that in the}} end did not have <b>to</b> be <b>redone.</b> The teacher’s communication with each other seems to be a key issue, {{and at the same time}} the use of drawings appears to be low, among the students as well as the teachers. The teachers’ own experience in construction work seems to be central to their transforming of the drawings into a student task. Despite didactic competence among the teachers, the students’ willingness to engage in a task seems to be affected by the experience of frequently being assigned <b>to</b> unnecessary <b>redoing</b> assignments.|$|R
