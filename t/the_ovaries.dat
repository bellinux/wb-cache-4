5|$|In fertilised queens, <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> {{only become}} active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond <b>the</b> <b>ovaries)</b> by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier {{was busy}} rehearsing for Orpheus, an English {{language}} version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of <b>the</b> <b>ovaries),</b> but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose {{not to have the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> and Fallopian tubes {{when the}} cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. <b>The</b> <b>ovaries</b> of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream.

5|$|Most of the {{available}} einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. <b>The</b> <b>ovaries</b> are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of <b>the</b> <b>ovaries.</b> Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E

5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by <b>the</b> <b>ovaries,</b> resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest <b>the</b> <b>ovaries.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of female insects {{consist of a}} pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts. <b>The</b> <b>ovaries</b> are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in <b>the</b> <b>ovaries</b> and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
