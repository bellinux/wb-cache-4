Environmental Economics, however, today offer us other methodological possibilities, whose application to <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> of this type of project may prove to be of interest. It is the case of <b>the</b> Contingent <b>Valuation</b> Method used for the evaluation {{of the effects of the}} Watershead Restoration and Erosion Control Projects of the Aljibe Basin (Almería) Spain, presented here. The results obtained show that, in this case study, application of Contingent Valuation ascribes greater social profitability of the project, with 5. 23 % of IRR (Internal Rate of Return), compared to the value obtained using classic methodology of 2. 25 %, thus enabling us to draw closer to the true socio-environmental value of this type of project.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether <b>the</b> dividend <b>valuation</b> {{changed after}} corporate accounting scandals {{such as that}} of Enron in October 2001 broke out. We find that dividend increasing firms experienced positive abnormal returns in the industry affected by corporate scandals up to four months after the first scandal in the industry became public.

To provide a perspective, we examine <b>the</b> dividend <b>valuation</b> <b>from</b> early 1980 s to early 2000 s, and find that <b>the</b> dividend <b>valuation</b> increased consistently for this time period.

Three scenarios were created {{to account for the}} uncertainty tied with the cyclicality of the business, and probabilities were assigned based on the economical reasonability of each. A final price of kr. 300, 51 was reached, implying that the firm is undervalued (market prices kr. 250). Secondly the Economic Value Added approach was conducted, providing insight on the periods in which the company is able to generate economic profit. The three scenarios were also used.

In a common value model, the participants have equal <b>valuations</b> of <b>the</b> item, but they do not have perfectly accurate information about this valuation. In lieu of knowing <b>the</b> exact <b>valuation</b> of <b>the</b> item, each participant can assume that any other participant obtains a random signal, which can be used to estimate <b>the</b> true <b>valuation,</b> <b>from</b> a probability distribution common to all bidders.

50|$|The price {{scissors}} {{is an economic}} phenomenon when for a certain group or sector of productive population <b>the</b> overall <b>valuation</b> <b>from</b> their production for sale outside this group drops below <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> of <b>the</b> demand of this group for goods produced outside the group {{after a period of}} reasonable equilibrium. A typical example is when changing world price levels cause a country’s exports to plummet in value, while <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> of its imports remains relatively stable. This phenomenon draws its name from a graphical illustration of its effects over time. Plotting time on a horizontal axis against price level on a vertical axis, with agricultural prices and industrial prices shown in two separate curves, the graph should appear like a pair of opening scissors. Historically, the phenomenon has most frequently taken the form of falling prices for agricultural produce and steady prices for industrial goods. Thus, the {{price scissors}} is most devastating to countries that are net agricultural exporters and net industrial importers. Perhaps the most vivid illustration {{of the effects of the}} price scissors and its potential effects occurred in countries throughout Eastern Europe in the early 1930s. The phenomenon is not exclusively of international scale: early Soviet Union had industry/agriculture price scissors internally, see Scissors Crisis.|$|R

The algebraic and tropical variety share many invariants, but due to its polyhedral structure the tropical variety is often easier to work with. In this thesis, we look at two problems related to constructing tropical varieties. In the first, we extend the theory of Grobner bases to the case where we are looking over a field with a <b>valuation.</b> <b>The</b> motivation {{is that we can}} use these Grobner bases in order to compute tropical varieties over fields with valuations. We discuss some complexity and implementation issues and present a family of ideals whose Grobner basis with respect to <b>the</b> p-adic <b>valuation</b> is small, but all of whose standard Grobner bases are large. In the second, we investigate finding tropical curves over fields with <b>the</b> trivial <b>valuation</b> <b>from</b> their two-dimensional coordinate projections. A tropical curve has the support of a one-dimensional fan, and we use its coordinate projections to reconstruct the rays of this fan. We discuss some implementation issues and we see examples of tropical curves which can be computed using our projection techniques which cannot be computed with existing techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the asset {{replacement}} problem in the perspective of optimal replacement time given a certain tax environment and depreciation policy. Using a real options approach, our model minimises current operation and maintenance costs and permits a new <b>valuation</b> of <b>the</b> replacement flexibility under a multi-cycle environment. The innovation on <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> process comes <b>from</b> adding an autonomous salvage value factor. Results from partial differential equations reveal relevant differences from those observed in one-factor models, specifically in optimal replacement levels and in the non-monotonous effects of salvage value variation. This paper provides enhancements to existing literature on equivalent annual cost by formulating a cost-minimisation problem conditioned by autonomous salvage value dynamics, and it contributes to Real Options literature by introducing a salvage value factor in <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> model...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing truthful auctions, when <b>the</b> bidders' <b>valuations</b> have a public and a private component. In particular, we consider combinatorial auctions where <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> of an agent i for a set S of items can be expressed as v_if(S), where v_i is a private single parameter of the agent, and the function f is publicly known. Our motivation behind studying this problem is two-fold: (a) Such valuation functions arise naturally {{in the case of}} ad-slots in broadcast media such as Television and Radio. For an ad shown in a set S of ad-slots, f(S) is, say, the number of unique viewers reached by the ad, and v_i is <b>the</b> <b>valuation</b> per-unique-viewer.

We present a general technique, based on maximal-in-range mechanisms, that converts any α-approximation non-truthful algorithm (α≤ 1) for this problem into Ω(α/n) and Ω(α) -approximate truthful mechanisms which run in polynomial time and quasi-polynomial time, respectively...|$|R
