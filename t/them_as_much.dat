Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and {{bought a house in}} Belgravia.|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image {{continued to}} erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> less malicious, protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire. According to {{a legend in}} the 18th-century , a tengu {{took the form of}} a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, Dean's division was the closest US ground unit to the Korean Peninsula. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered Walker to deploy the division to South Korea as quickly as possible to resist the advancing forces of North Korea. Dean was ordered to send an advance battalion from his division by air to South Korea with a mission to advance and resist leading elements of the North Korean People's Army in an effort to delay <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible while the remainder of the division followed by sea. Dean was given command of all US forces in Korea, and his division numbered 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles at the time. On July 1, Dean organized the 406-man Task Force Smith from components of the US 21st Infantry Regiment and ordered it into Korea, as the advance force. As Task Force Smith advanced, Dean himself landed in Taejon on July 3 and set up his command post with Brigadier General John H. Church, the Assistant Division Commander, and Brigadier General George B. Barth, the Division Artillery commander, as his deputies. Dean ordered Barth forward to act as his forward commander for Task Force Smith, which began digging in at Osan to resist North Korean troops advancing after the capture of Seoul. Task Force Smith was subsequently defeated by North Koreans at the Battle of Osan the next day, and pushed back.|$|E

25|$|Kent, Howard Hansen, the Riglers, and Curtiss readily {{acknowledged}} {{that it had been}} extremely difficult to determine the course of the study, but maintained that all disputes during the meetings were impersonal and typical of scientific discourse. David Rigler said that, despite his disagreements with Shurley, Shurley's early recommendations were the only useful advice he received on handling Genie and he attempted to follow <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible. The Riglers and Curtiss further stated that everyone involved in Genie's life, with the exception of Jean Butler Ruch, worked together as best they could to rehabilitate Genie and never fought with each other, and independently denied allegations of factionalism. Ruch never stated a motive for her actions, but members of the research team believed they were due to her anger over her foster custody rejection and her perception that Children's Hospital staff influenced the decision. The role of the scientists in Genie's case has become the source of debate within the scientific community.|$|E
500|$|Sir Joseph now realises that Ralph {{should have}} been the Captain, and the Captain {{should have been}} Ralph. He summons both, and they emerge wearing one another's uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the Pinafore, and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph's {{marriage}} with Josephine is now [...] "out of the question" [...] in his eyes: [...] "love levels all ranks... to a considerable extent, but it does not level <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as that." [...] He hands her to Captain Rackstraw. The former Captain's now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing.|$|E
500|$|Since {{dance is}} often [...] "associated {{with the female}} body and women's experiences", female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been {{regarded}} as distinct from [...] "decent" [...] women because they [...] "use their bodies {{to make a living}} instead of hiding <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible". Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as [...] "the most shameful form of entertainment", other cultures have established venues such as strip clubs where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as striptease are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.|$|E

500|$|The album {{consists}} of 22 songs, {{most of which}} are short, under 3 minutes, and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, [...] "sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field -toting skits". He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V. Club compared the album to a buffet, where [...] "Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as they have them, giving <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> attention as they need, and {{moving on to the next}} thing". Tim O'Neil of PopMatters praised Madlib's instrumentals and said that they [...] "make the album a sonic feast".|$|E
500|$|Jacqui {{has been}} {{described}} as a feisty character who is tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a [...] "tough ex-con". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick up the pieces for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water. Montgomery described his army as [...] "half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British {{showed no sign of}} giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as we can with shells." [...] Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.|$|E

500|$|God of War: Ascension {{received}} generally favorable reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave it {{an average}} review score of 79.34% (based on 58 reviews) and 80/100 (based on 89 reviews), respectively. Critics praised the fundamental gameplay and spectacle, but were {{critical of the}} lack of new ideas and gave a mixed response to the additional multiplayer mode. Alex Simmons of IGN said the redesigned combat system adds a source of depth: [...] "Learning how to use each power effectively...provides a strategic lifeline when there's no energy re-gen chest nearby". Although he initially found the World Weapons useful, he felt that they became unnecessary after upgrading the Blades of Chaos. Simmons felt the magic system was a [...] "positive step"; since magic attacks are unlocked at a later time, players cannot rely on <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as they may have done in previous installments, which encourages players [...] "to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset".|$|E
