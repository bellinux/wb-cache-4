40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the region}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, the so-called <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> This thesis presents the initial stage of development of a simplified seafloor support model. This model simulates the seafloor-pipe interaction as a flexible pipe supported {{on a bed of}} springs. Constants for the soil springs were derived from finite element studies performed in a separate, parallel investigation. These supports are comprised of elasto-plastic springs with spring constants being a function of soil stiffness and strength, and the geometry of the trench within the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> Deflections and bending stresses in the pipe are computed based on a finite element method and a finite difference formulation developed in this research project. The finite difference algorithm has capabilities for analyzing linear springs, non-linear springs, and springs having a tension cut-off. The latter feature simulates the effect of a pipe pulling out of contact with the soil. The model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of soil stiffness, soil strength, trench geometry, amplitude of pipe displacements, pipe stiffness, and length of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> on pipe deflections and bending stresses. In conclusions, the seafloor stiffness (as characterized by the three spring parameters), the magnitude of pipe displacement, and the length of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> all influence bending stresses in the pipe. Also, the tension cutoff effect, i. e., the pipe pulling away from the soil, can have a very large effect on bending stresses in the pipe. Neglecting this effect can lead to serious over-estimate of stress levels and excessive conservatism in design...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{instrument}} approaches {{were made}} to Category 1 minimums followed by a visual landing on a 100 x 1700 ft STOL runway. Data were obtained for variations in the aircraft's flare response characteristics and control techniques and for different combinations of aircraft and runway lighting and a visual approach slope indication. With the complete aircraft and runway lighting and visual guidance no degradation in flying qualities or landing performance was observed compared to daylight operations. elimination of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> floodlights or the aircraft landing lights led to somewhat greater pilot workload; however, the landing could still be accomplished successfully. Loss of both <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> and aircraft landing lights led to a high workload situation and only a marginally adequate to inadequate landing capability...|$|R

5000|$|By {{following}} controller {{commands to}} keep the landing aircraft on both glidepath and approach centerline, a pilot will arrive precisely over the runway's <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> In order to insure continuous radio communication integrity, controllers are required to make radio transmissions at certain minimum intervals {{depending on the type}} of approach flow and phase of the approach. In order to land, pilots must have the runway or runway environment in sight prior to reaching the [...] "decision height," [...] for PAR approaches (usually 100-400 ft above the runway <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone)</b> or prior to the [...] "Missed Approach Point" [...] for non-precision approaches. The published minimum visibility and decision height/minimum descent altitude vary depending upon the approach and runway lighting, obstacles in the approach corridor, type of aircraft, and other factors. Pilots of revenue flights periodically must demonstrate PAR approach proficiency, and GCA controllers must conduct a minimum number of such approaches in a year to maintain competency.|$|R

The cause of the accident was deemed to have been pilot error in landing well past the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> in poor visibility conditions at night. At the time runway 08 did not have ILS. The co-pilot suffered severe spinal injuries but the commanding pilot and seven passengers escaped with only minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{required}} minimum visibility for instrument approaches {{is influenced}} by the presence and type of approach lighting system. In the U.S., a CAT I ILS approach without approach lights will have a minimum required visibility of 3/4 mile, or 4000 foot runway visual range. With a 1400-foot or longer approach light system, the minimum potential visibility might be reduced to 1/2 mile (2400 runway visual range), and the presence of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> and centerline lights with a suitable approach light system might further reduce the visibility to 3/8 mile (1800 feet runway visual range).|$|R
5000|$|On 15 July 2010, a Prince Aviation Cessna 550 Citation II YU-BSG overrun {{the runway}} while landing at Bol Airport.

40|$|Rural two-lane {{highways}} {{constitute the}} majority of the road system in the United States. Over 62 percent of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) center line highway miles are two-lane highways. No-passing zones, which are indicated by solid lines separating the traffic moving in opposite directions, tell drivers where there are segments of two-lane highways that do not have sufficient sight distance to safely perform passing maneuvers. This study describes a method for automating the process for locating no-passing zones using global positioning system (GPS) data. The author developed a new analytical algorithm to evaluate three-dimensional passing sight distances that will work for any arbitrary alignment of two-lane highway. The algorithm was incorporated into a computer model that uses GPS data as the input and results in the locations for no-passing zones. The steps involved in the process include collecting the GPS data, converting it to a form that models the roadway center line, evaluating the availability of passing sight distance, and determining the locations where no-passing <b>zone</b> <b>markings</b> should be placed. The resulting automated system processes GPS coordinates and converts them into easting and northing values, smoothes GPS data and evaluates roadway alignments for possible sight restrictions that indicate where no-passing zones should be located. The automated system was tested on three highway segments using two different GPS receivers, and the results obtained were in general agreement with the existing locations of no-passing <b>zone</b> <b>markings.</b> The verification results indicate that the algorithm and the computer program developed in this dissertation can be used to determine the availability of passing sight distance and locate no-passing zones...|$|R

40|$|Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) is {{a popular}} {{solution}} for a floating production facility in the deep and ultra-deep ocean. In the analysis of SCR, the behavioral characteristics are investigated to check the failure modes by assessing the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} the stress and strain which SCR goes through in time series. SCR is affected by the motions of connected floating production facility and exciting environmental loads. The driven force and motion of SCR has an interaction with seabed soil which represents the stiffness and friction force where SCR touches the seabed. Dynamic response of SCR is primarily caused by the coupled motion of floating structure. The displacement of floating structure is often large and fast enough to cause short cycles of negative and positive tension on SCR. The interaction between SCR and seabed is concentrated at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> resulting into the compression and corresponding deformation of pipeline at the position. This paper presents models of floating production facilities and connected mooring lines and SCRs in 100 -year hurricane environmental loads and seabed, focusing on the motional characteristics of SCR at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> In time series simulation, the model of SCR is first analyzed as a pipeline with indefinite elasticity so that the SCR does not fail even if the exciting loads exceed the property limit of SCR. Then the SCR design is manually checked using criteria for each failure mode to estimate the integrity...|$|R
