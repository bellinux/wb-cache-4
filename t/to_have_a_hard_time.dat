40|$|Abstract. In the 1960 s, the {{technique}} of using cluster expansion bounds {{in order to achieve}} bounds on the virial expansion was developed by Lebowitz and Penrose (1964) and Ruelle (1969). This technique is generalised to more recent cluster expansion bounds by Poghosyan and Ueltschi (2009), which are related to the work of Procacci (2007) and the tree-graph identity, detailed by Brydges (1986). The bounds achieved by Lebowitz and Penrose can also be sharpened by doing the actual optimisation and achieving ex-pressions in terms of the Lambert W-function. The different bound from the cluster expansion shows some improvements for bounds on the convergence of the virial expan-sion in the case of positive potentials, which are allowed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> core. 1...|$|R
50|$|The DEC Rainbow 100 had no general {{expansion}} bus.

Univation produced a Ethernet card that could boot the Rainbow over the network for that slot, but most users preferred <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> drive instead. While the software incompatibilities were bad, the lack of expansion hardware flexibility was worse, and the inability to use ISA cards, despite their flaws at the time, played a significant role in the Rainbow fading from the scene more quickly than the original IBM-PC.|$|R
