In both cases, the milk had been inoculated with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 at a concentration of ca. 5. 1 log CFU/ml and with thermophilic or mesophilic starter cultures at a concentration of ca. 5. 3 to 5. 6 log CFU/ml. In the first 10 h of cheesemaking, the pathogen increased by 1. 18 and 0. 82 log CFU/g in Feta cheese and by 1. 56 and 1. 35 log CFU/g in <b>Telemes</b> <b>cheese</b> for the trials with thermophilic and mesophilic starters, respectively. After 24 h of fermentation, a decrease in E. coli O 157 :H 7 was observed for all trials. At that time, the pH was reduced to 4. 81 to 5. 10 for all trials. Fresh cheeses were salted and held at 16 degreesC for ripening until the pH was reduced to 4. 60. Cheeses were then moved into storage at 4 degreesC to complete ripening. During ripening, the E. coli O 157 :H 7 population decreased significantly (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001) and finally was not detectable in Feta cheese after 44 and 36 days and in <b>Telemes</b> <b>cheese</b> after 40 and 30 days for the trials with thermophilic and mesophilic starters, respectively. The estimated times required for one decimal reduction of the population of E. coli O 157 :H 7 after the first day of processing were 9. 71 and 9. 26 days for Feta cheese and 9. 09 and 7. 69 days for <b>Telemes</b> <b>cheese</b> for the trials with thermophilic and mesophilic starters, respectively...|$|E

The cheeses produced in the two cheese-making trials were allowed to ripen for 2 months and stored for an addition al 4 months to simulate commercial production of <b>Telemes</b> <b>cheese.</b> Concentrations of aflatoxin M- 1 in whey, curd, brine, and the produced cheeses were determined at intervals by liquid chromatography and fluorometric detection coupled with immunoaffinity column extraction. Concentrations of aflatoxin M- 1 in the produced curds {{were found to be}} 3. 9 and 4. 4 times higher than those in milk, whereas concentrations in whey were lower than those in curd and milk. Aflatoxin M- 1 was present in cheese at higher concentrations at the beginning than {{at the end of the}} ripening/storage period, and it declined to concentrations 2. 7 and 3. 4 times higher than those initially present in milk by the end of the sixth month of storage. Concentrations of aflatoxin M- 1 in brine started low and increased by the end of the ripening/storage period but only a portion of the amounts of aflatoxin M- 1 lost from cheese was found in the brine. Results showed that Telemes cheeses produced from milk containing aflatoxin M- 1 at a concentration close to either the maxim um acceptable level of 0. 05 mug/l set by the European union (EU) or at double this value, will contain the toxin at a level that is much lower or slightly higher, respectively, than the maximum acceptable level of 0. 250 mug of aflatoxin M- 1 /kg cheese set by some countries...|$|E

40|$|Raw milk {{represents}} a nutritive environment {{for a number}} of pathogens, like Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7, Staphylococcus aureus etc. This fact can cause a serious of foodborne outbreaks associated to the consumption of contaminated milk and derivated products. The traditional processing of raw milk in poor hygiene conditions can pose a serious microbiological risk. The study aimed at evaluating the incidence of pathogen bacteria in ripened traditional cheese by advanced biochemical and molecular methods in order to reveal the possible risk of consumer exposure. The study was applied on 150 samples of riepened cheese from the follwoing types: salted <b>teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> and „Burduf” cheese and „Năsal” <b>cheese.</b> The traditional <b>teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> presented an average value of the total E. coli count in between 11. 06 ± 0. 52 - 38. 33 ± 2. 76 cfu/g. The risk represented by the presence of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus is low within the first steps of ripening, being absent after 28 months of ripeneing in the <b>teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> samples. The Staphylococcus aureus load was in between 3. 82 ± 0. 12 log cfu/g for the first period of ripeneing in „Burduf” cheese and 0. 27 ± 0. 56 log cfu/g after the second period of maturation, following a descendant pathway towards the last period of ripening. In „Năsal” cheese we isolated the specific Brevibacterium linens, which gives the characteristics of this type of cheese, but also Micrococcus spp., in 35 % and lactic streptococci in  20 %. The traditional cheese evaluated represent a low risk of contamination given that no sample investigated has exceeded the maximum limits allowed by the legislation and no pathogen bacteria isolated...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{mesophilic}} {{lactic acid}} bacteria {{in the production of}} traditional white brine cheeses of Feta and Teleme was studied. The environmental conditions which prevail in these cheeses during the ripping period favor the growth of mesophilic starters which maintain high numbers in populations. This was concluded from the results of the microbiological examination of 32 samples of traditional Feta and <b>Teleme</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The dominant lactic acid bacterium isolated was Lactobacillus plantarum (45, 7 % of the isolates) followed by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (22 % of the isolates). Lactobacillus plantarum is an acid and salt tolerant bacterium and probably this is the reason for its dominance in the {{lactic acid bacteria}} population of Feta and <b>Teleme</b> <b>cheeses.</b> On the contrary Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis is registered as non acid and salt tolerant. However our isolates were found in high numbers in ripened feta cheese samples, which suggest an adaptation of this strains to the environmental condition (temperature and pH) which exist in the ripened cheese. For the selection of the strains which were used in our experiments we isolated and tested 109 strains, but after the preliminary tests we kept 37 strains of Lactobacillus and 22 strains of Lactococcus. The strains selected were further tested for their lactose fermenting ability and acidification velocity. Finally we selected five strains identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (2 strains), Lactobacillus paracasei (1 strain), Lactobacillus brevis (1 strain) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain) The above strains were used in 8 different combinations, alone or with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. We used eight combinations for the experimental production of Feta cheese (Lb. plantarum/Str. thermophilus, Lb. brevis/Str. thermophilus, Lb. plantarum/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Lb. brevis/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Lb. paracasei/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Str. thermophilus/Lb. bulgaricus/Lb. plantarum/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Str. thermophilus/Lb. bulgaricus/ Lb. brevis /Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Str. thermophilus/Lb. bulgaricus). Each one of the combinations was used to prepare four (4) different lots of Feta cheese, keeping all the other parameters of the production according to the traditional technology. The cheese was observed and analyzed for bacteriological and chemical parameters during a period of 120 days. From the results obtained it was answered that: Lactobacilli and Lactococci increased {{from the beginning of the}} process reaching a population of the order of more than 7, 0 log /g. This population was maintained during the whole ripening period (2 months) and furthermore (120 days). Only in the lots prepared with the combination Str. thermophilus/Lb. bulgaricus, lactic acid bacteria declined to a 6, 0 log /g at the end of the ripening period. It was also observed that except of the yeast population which was increased all of the bacteriological parameters tested (coliforms, staphylococcus spp. Total contaminating bacteria, psychrotrophic bacteria, proteolytic and lipolytic bacteria) were gradually decreasing during the ripening period. On the other hand chemical analysis, showed a sharp increase in acidity (pH dropped in the cheese curd to 4, 5 within 3 - 5 days) and a progressing degree of proteolysis and lipolysis up to the desirable level for this kind of cheese. The overall judgment of the taste panel gave a very good or excellent mark to all of the lots. This encourages us to suggest that mesophilic starter cultures can be used alone or in combination with the traditional culture (Lb. bulgaricus / Str. thermophilus) in the production of feta cheese. In particular our results refer to the wild (autochthonus) strain of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, which proved to be well adapted to the environmental conditions which prevail in feta cheese. For the production of <b>teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> four combinations of lactic starter were used (Lb. bulgaricus/Str. thermophilus/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis/Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis/Str. thermophilus, Lb. paracasei/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Lb. plantarum/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis). Each one of the combination was used in the production of four different lots of <b>Teleme</b> <b>cheese.</b> The results obtained are similar to those for Feta cheese. Combinations Lb. plantarum/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. paracasei/Lc. lactis subsp. lactis was given the highest score from the taste panel. In conclusion the use of mesophilic starters as in the case of Feta cheese can be used, alone or in addition to the classic starters (Str. thermophilus/Lb. bulgaricus) for <b>Teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> production. Furthermore, dry salting of <b>Teleme</b> <b>cheese</b> in the beginning of the process will improve its quality. ...|$|R
