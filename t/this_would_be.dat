5|$|Subsequently, in 1949 a crest was {{designed}} to replace the spartan BRITISH RAILWAYS logo. In turn, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> replaced in 1956 by yet another design of crest.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> race <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Neil Castles' final race in his NASCAR Cup Series career. It <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> {{the last}} race for Doc Faustina before his retirement.

50|$|Longtime {{cast member}} Bill Hader, {{on the show}} since 2005, {{announced}} on May 14, 2013 that <b>this</b> season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his last. In addition to Hader, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> the final season for Fred Armisen, {{who had been with}} the show since 2002, and for Jason Sudeikis, who had been a cast member since 2005, as well as previously writing for the show since 2003. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> the only season for featured player Tim Robinson, who would leave his spot in the cast to instead join the writing staff the following season.|$|R
50|$|Usually <b>this</b> system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{used with}} the ABC's radio {{programmes}} for schools. The teachers wouldtune the tuner into the programme, and switch it to the appropriate class room or class rooms. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> sometimes also <b>be</b> done, for assemblies outside where the yard speaker <b>would</b> <b>be</b> switched in.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{prohibited}} by the restriction against case stacking in Wagiman if the genitive -gin were a case suffix.|$|E
5|$|A full long count date {{consisted}} of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off {{the number of}} bak'tuns, kat'uns, tuns, winals, and k'ins {{since the start of}} the current creation. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> followed by the tz'olkin portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the Haab portion of the Calendar Round date.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E

50|$|First, the XML {{document}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{transformed into}} an intermediate form.

5|$|Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A Thuggee {{priest who}} {{performs}} rituals of human sacrifices. The character {{is named after}} a 17th-century Indian painter. Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow (as <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sacrilegious), and used a latex shrunken head.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} {{the finding that the}} state court's decision was reasonable. However, O'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Early on March 15, {{hours after}} the NCAA and NIT fields were announced, Duquesne {{accepted}} a bid into the CBI. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Duquesne's 23rd postseason appearance and first in the CBI, which started in 2008. This also {{marked the first time}} since 1981 that the Dukes made two consecutive postseason appearances. It was announced that the Dukes would face off against the Princeton Tigers at Jadwin Gymnasium on March 17.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> season <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> {{the last}} for {{longtime}} cast member Will Forte, {{who had been}} with the show since 2002. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> the only season for featured player Jenny Slate, who was let go after the season ended.|$|R
5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller has {{expressed}} an intention {{to oversee the}} process required to change Jamaica to a republic by 2012; she originally stated <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> complete by August of that year.

5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E

5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this was}} another {{temporary}} home. The club stayed here until 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club's first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the first of a}} trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E

5|$|In August 2006, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) {{announced}} that the database would include telephone numbers or addresses of celebrities' children.
