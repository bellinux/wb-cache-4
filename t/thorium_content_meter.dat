40|$|The <b>thorium</b> <b>content</b> of mine dust {{collected}} at various locations along the drift to the SNO site has been measured with several techniques- direct counting, proton induced x-ray emission, x-ray fluorescence, and neutron activation analysis.

The average Th content of the six samples obtained by direct counting and by XRF measurements is a factor of two higher than the value of 5 ppm (for norite) that we have used in cleanliness calculations. The larger average concentration of Th in dust that enters the cavity via equipment and personnel therefore suggests that cleanliness requirements be tightened by a factor of 2. The results for Fe indicate a positive, though not complete, correlation with the Th content.

Existence of granite allows formed deposits of radioactive minerals that prospect of the uranium and thorium. This research goal is to identify radioactive minerals occurrences on granit Muncung in the initial stage for prospect assessment of uranium and thorium in Singkep Island. The Methodologies are granite sampling, petrography analysis of Muncung granite samples, uranium and <b>thorium</b> <b>content</b> analysis and grain size analysis of pan concentrate samples. Radioactive minerals in Muncung granite are monazite and zircon, while in pan concentrate they are monazite, zircon, and xenotime. The percentage of monazite, zircon, and xenotime in the pan concentrate are 1. 1 – 59. 53 %, 0. 68 – 55. 07 %, and 0. 3 – 3. 54 % respectively.

The complex geological structure of Wzgórza Niemczansko-Strzelinskie (south-west Poland) enabled this problem to be studied in various geological conditions. The eU and eTh content in rocks and soil was measured by gamma-spectrometer GR- 320. Uranium content of bedrock reached its maximum value of 15 ppm {{in the case of}} quartz-graphite schist. Thorium reached its maximum value of 35 ppm in the case of granodiorite. Radon activity was measured by means of long-term exposure of LR- 115. The mean value of atmospheric radon activity was 21 Bqm- 3 in the air 2 m above the ground surface. The highest radon activities were measured in the area of granite and quartz-graphite schist outcrops and in the area of mylonitic rocks of the Niemcza Zone.
