5|$|Deimatic display {{occurs in}} widely {{separated}} groups of animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises and phasmids among <b>the</b> <b>insects.</b> In the cephalopods, {{different species of}} octopuses, squids, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus are deimatic.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
50|$|Beauveria bassiana {{infection}} causes high {{mortality of}} <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> Other fungi that attack <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> are: Hirsutella eleutheratorum, Paecilomyces sp. (<b>the</b> <b>insect</b> pathogenic {{species in the}} genus Paecilomyces have been renamed as Isaria), and Metarhizium anisopliae.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> plant lures <b>insects</b> in by {{producing}} a sweet smelling secretion that draws them {{close to the}} tentacles. Once <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> is caught <b>the</b> tentacles contract to engulf <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and cover it with sticky mucus. Once caught in <b>the</b> trap <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> either dies of exhaustion or of suffocation as the sticky mucus clogs their spiracles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>insect</b> {{research}} {{element of}} the program was managed by the Canadian Space Agency, and the prime contractor for <b>the</b> <b>Insect</b> Habitat was Routes AstroEngineering, of Ottawa, Ontario.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, the extinct {{pterosaur}} {{also shows}} an independent evolution of vertebrate fore- and hindlimbs to wing. An even more distantly related group, <b>the</b> <b>insects,</b> have wings that evolved separately from different organs.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like <b>the</b> <b>insects,</b> he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>insects,</b> in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
50|$|When {{a healthy}} insect vector feeds by {{piercing}} the vein of a leaf and sucking the phloem sap, the pathogen is ingested into the gut of <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> Before <b>the</b> infection can be spread from plant to plant, an incubation period {{is needed for}} distribution throughout <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> Once <b>the</b> phytoplasma is ingested from the plant, it multiplies in the gut of <b>the</b> <b>insect,</b> travels into <b>the</b> hemolymph, then to the salivary glands. Here, in high enough concentrations, the phytoplasma is transmitted into new plants when <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> feeds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second phase}} of host-plant finding is for <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> to make short flights from leaf to leaf to assess the plant's overall suitability. The number of leaf-to-leaf flights varies {{according}} to <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> species and to the host-plant stimulus received from each leaf. But <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> must accumulate sufficient stimuli from the host-plant to lay eggs; so it must make {{a certain number of}} consecutive [...] "appropriate" [...] landings. Hence if it makes an [...] "inappropriate landing", the assessment of that plant is negative and <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> must start <b>the</b> process anew.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{conidium}} or blastospore of Isaria fumosorosea {{lands on}} a suitable host, it produces enzymes to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>insect's</b> cuticle. A germ tube then grows into the haemocoel [...] and the fungus proliferates inside <b>the</b> <b>insect’s</b> body. <b>The</b> fungus can also enter through the spiracles, the mouth or the anal opening. The mycelia {{spread in the}} haemolymph and tissues, eventually emerging from <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and producing conidia. Mortality of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> has been ascribed to the drainage of its nutrients, the destruction of its tissues {{and the release of}} toxins.|$|R
5|$|As {{the plant}} grows, it will sprout leaves; these both {{increase}} {{the growth rate}} and increase its vulnerability to <b>the</b> <b>insects.</b> Once the plant reaches a predetermined height, the player {{will be able to}} advance to the next level. A life will be deducted whenever the plant dies or the player makes contact with an insect.|$|E
5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> search for new food sources.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> can be serious pests. They are used as food {{in countries such as}} Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{distance}} <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> falls between wingbeats {{depends on}} how rapidly its wings are beating. If <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> flaps its wings at a slow rate, the time interval during which the lifting force is zero is longer, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> falls farther than if its wings were beating rapidly. One can calculate the wingbeat frequency necessary for <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> to maintain a given stability in its amplitude. To simplify the calculations, one must assume that the lifting force is at a finite constant value while the wings are moving down {{and that it is}} zero while the wings are moving up. During the time interval Δt of the upward wingbeat, <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> drops a distance h under the influence of gravity.|$|R
25|$|The life-cycles of Plasmodium species involve several {{different}} stages both in <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and <b>the</b> vertebrate host. These stages include sporozoites, which are injected by <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> vector into <b>the</b> vertebrate host's blood. Sporozoites infect the host liver, {{giving rise to}} merozoites and (in some species) hypnozoites. These move into the blood where they infect red blood cells. In the red blood cells, the parasites can either form more merozoites to infect more red blood cells, or produce gametocytes which are taken up by insects which feed on the vertebrate host. In <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> host, gametocytes merge to sexually reproduce. After sexual reproduction, parasites grow into new sporozoites, which move to <b>the</b> <b>insect's</b> salivary glands, from which they can infect a vertebrate host bitten by <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b>|$|R

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive studies of <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> in the Amazon basin, {{and especially the}} butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Mantises were {{considered}} to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> most commonly kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. <b>The</b> <b>insects</b> keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
50|$|The life-cycles of Plasmodium species involve several {{different}} stages both in <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> and <b>the</b> vertebrate host.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Insect</b> Play {{was often}} invoked in {{political}} discussions in the 1930s. E. M. Forster likened {{the conflict between}} the British Union of Fascists and the Communist Party of Great Britain to [...] "a scene from <b>The</b> <b>Insect</b> Play". Ethel Mannin, writing in the anti-Stalinist magazine New Leader of July 6, 1936, described life in Stalin's Russia as resembling <b>The</b> <b>Insect</b> Play.|$|R
25|$|In the {{examples}} used the frequency used is 110 beats/s, {{which is the}} typical frequency found in insects. Butterflies have a much slower frequency with about 10 beats/s, {{which means that they}} can't hover. Other insects may be able to produce a frequency of 1000 beats/s. To restore <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> to its original vertical position, the average upward force during the downward stroke, Fav, must be equal to twice the weight of <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> Note that since the upward force on <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> body is applied only for half the time, the average upward force on <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> is simply its weight.|$|R
5|$|The Quarry Pool {{is now a}} {{significant}} part of the nature reserve features of the head. While it was very acidic in the early years, since 1990 it has allowed the growth of {{a significant}} number of plant and insect species, as well as mallard and little grebe. <b>The</b> <b>insects</b> provide valuable food for migrating sand martins and swallows.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>insects</b> {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes {{are too small to}} serve any role in pollination. It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} insect flight remain obscure, since the {{earliest}} winged insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, no evidence suggests <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.|$|E

50|$|The {{wildlife}} photographer Ken Middleham {{who shot}} <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> sequences for Phase IV also shot <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> sequences for <b>the</b> documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle. Both feature {{extensive use of}} close-up photography of insects.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies on}} the biology and life cycle of <b>the</b> deforliator <b>insect</b> Ammalo insulata walk. (Lep. Arctiidae), {{introduce}} to Sri Lanka to control the pernicious weed Chromolaena odorata Robinson, indicated that <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> could complete <b>the</b> life cycle on the two known hosts, C. odorata and Ageratum conyzoides but preffered C. odorata Fluctuations on <b>the</b> deforliator <b>insect</b> population in a locality were monitored while periodc increases of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> coinciding with new generations were noted. Larval and pupal mortality appear to be major constraint in the successful establishment of <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> <b>The</b> larval population was also low during the dry season. Some changes inthe insect population in relation to host and climatic factors have been noted...|$|R
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), <b>the</b> <b>insects</b> {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>insects</b> are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used to ward off <b>the</b> <b>insects,</b> predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|This species falsely lures naïve, {{recently}} emerged bees {{with the}} offer of pollen, {{but it is not}} fulfilled.The beard of the flower is deceptive in that once <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> lands on it, the lip of the beard swings down, hingelike, placing <b>the</b> <b>insect’s</b> head and back on the column thereby picking up the pollinum, or placing the pollinum on the stigma if <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> already carries a load on its back.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bacteria}} are released in <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> hemocoel, where they overcome <b>the</b> <b>insect's</b> defense systems and produce numerous virulence {{factors such as}} hemolysin and cytotoxin. They participate in suppressing insect immunity and killing the host.|$|R
40|$|Two new {{nematodes}} of {{the family}} Tetradonematidae, parasitic in aquatic dipterous insects in Louisiana, are presented. Corethrellonema grandispiculosum n. gen., n. sp., from the chaoborid fly, Corethrella brakeleyi Coquillett, and Aproctonema chapmani n. sp., from the sand fly, Culicoides arboricola Root and Hoffman, are described and illustrated. The biology and life histories of these nematodes show that the adults occur in the last larval instar of <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> host. <b>The</b> adult nematodes mate in the body cavity of <b>the</b> <b>insect,</b> and later <b>the</b> female nematode, replete with eggs, exits from the larval fly causing the death of <b>the</b> <b>insect.</b> Male nematodes usually remain in <b>the</b> <b>insect</b> cadaver...|$|R
