40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common, chronic, {{inflammatory}} disease. Psoriasis requires {{long time}} therapy to maintain {{disease control and}} psoriasis patients deserve long-term controlled treatment of their disease with optimal safety. Traditional treatment like phototherapy or systemic therapy with cyclosporin, metotrexate and retinoids are not always effective or cause long-term side effects. New biological, which targets pathologic T cell activity, agents like tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors and T cell modulators are developed. OBJECTIVE: Review literature in order to investigate treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, new versus <b>traditional</b> <b>medicaments.</b> METHODS: This assignment {{is based on a}} review of relevant studies in the Pubmed database. RESULTS: There is to date no large controlled studies investigating the long term side effects of “biologics” and conclusions regarding long-term safety cannot be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence that biological agents are efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Comparing the side effects for traditional and new agents, shows that new medicaments “biologics” are safer for long term treatment than <b>traditional</b> <b>medicaments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Allergic {{disorders}} {{are common in}} the UK. This study reviews recent UK time trends in the prevalence, morbidity and mortality for allergic disorders, excluding asthma. Methods: A trend analysis was performed over recent decades of national, representative or repeat surveys, primary care consultations, prescriptions, hospital admissions, and mortality. Results: Serial surveys showed that the prevalence of diagnosed allergic rhinitis and eczema in children have both trebled {{over the last three}} decades. While these long term trends were paralleled by the prevalence of disease symptoms, more recent symptom prevalence data suggest a decline. Similarly, GP consultation rates rose by 260 % for hay fever and by 150 % <b>for</b> <b>eczema</b> overall during the period 1971 – 91, but rates have stabilised over the past decade. Hospital admissions <b>for</b> <b>eczema</b> have been stable since 1995, and hospital admissions for allergic rhinitis have fallen to about 40 % of their 1990 levels. Since 1990, admissions for anaphylaxis have increased by 700 %, for food allergy by 500 %, for urticaria by 100 %, and for angio-oedema by 40 %. Prescriptions issued for all types of allergy have increased since 1991.

40|$|Eczema is {{a common}} chronic illness of {{childhood}} which can significantly impair {{the quality of life}} of affected children. Parents of children with eczema face particular challenges associated with managing the disease, and research indicates that child behaviour difficulties, dysfunctional parenting styles, parent psychological adjustment, and parents 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy <b>for</b> performing <b>eczema</b> management tasks can affect parents 2 ̆ 7 ability to successfully manage their child 2 ̆ 7 s condition. The present study examined the relationship between these variables and both the intensity of problematic child behaviours specific to eczema and parents 2 ̆ 7 confidence for dealing with such behaviours. Parents of children aged 3 - 10 years with eczema (N = 269) completed a battery of questionnaires including a newly developed measure, the Eczema Behaviour Checklist (EBC). Results showed excellent internal consistency for both the Intensity and Confidence subscales of the EBC, and construct validity indicated by a positive correlation between parents‟ self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>eczema</b> management and parents‟ confidence for dealing with problematic child eczema behaviours. As expected, greater intensity of problematic child eczema behaviours was associated with reduced parental confidence for managing these behaviours.
