500|$|The {{character}} of Walter Skinner had {{evolved over the}} course of The X-Files sixth season. At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt that Skinner's character was becoming [...] "expendable". With their transfer away from the X-Files division, Mulder and Scully saw less and less of their former boss. Originally, John Shiban, the writer of the episode, wanted to infect Mulder with nanobots. However, he decided that since the audience knew Mulder would not be killed, this plot would not be very effective. In order to compensate for this loss, Shiban decided to re-work Skinner back into the series mythology by putting him in Mulder's place. Shiban, inspired by the 1950 noir film D.O.A. and its 1988 remake which he jokingly called [...] " [...] pretty bad movies", decided to craft an episode of The X-Files around the conceit of [...] "a guy who's been poisoned [...] has only a short time to live and has to use that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why and by whom he's being murdered".|$|E
500|$|At Kabul, {{the group}} was {{accommodated}} as state guests at the Emir's palace at Bagh-e Babur. Despite the comfort and the welcome, it was soon clear {{that they were all}} but confined. Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> {{as much as he could}} about the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt as much as he could about his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E

At {{the time they were}} owned by Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat, and Lady Grange was housed with his tacksman, another Alexander MacDonald, and his wife. When she complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes, or food other than the normal fare {{he and his wife were}} used to. She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to Orkney, but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Behe, a {{biologist}} at Lehigh University and an advocate of intelligent design, felt that by [...] "talking on {{about the age of}} the Earth [...] than on the elegance and complexities of life", both Ham and Nye lost the debate. Metropolitan Nicholas of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking holy orders, also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that [...] "Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Draper had to {{work very}} {{carefully}} in regards to venereal disease control, but other aspects of his tenure as Virginia's health commissioner worked very smoothly. [...] The state kept a close liaison with the Hygeneic Laboratory when problems arose which they could not handle, and the laboratory would sometimes send experts down to help them, {{and at other times}} Virginia would send its practitioners to the Hygeneic Laboratory for some brushing up or further training. [...] Draper's time as Virginia's Health Commissioner ended in 1934 {{when he returned to the}} headquarters of the Public Health Service. [...] One of the big initiatives within this organization in the next two years, spearheaded by Dr. Parran, was to bring the plight of venereal diseases into the public domain where it could be discussed and handled openly. [...] A humorous outcome of this occurred when Draper was selected to speak to a woman's organization, and he called the secretary of the group ahead of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if he could discuss venereal diseases.
