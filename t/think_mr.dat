2500|$|In 2013 Yates's {{attorneys}} filed a {{habeas corpus}} petition in federal district court, stating that Yates is mentally ill and, [...] "through {{no fault of}} his own ... suffers from a severe paraphilic disorder" [...] that predisposed him to commit murder. [...] The still-pending motion {{is regarded as a}} [...] "long shot" [...] by most observers. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Yates helps his cause by relying on the fact that he's a necrophiliac," [...] said Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist.|$|E
2500|$|... "In Mother's room last night," [...] Ellen Emerson {{wrote her}} sister Edith on November 20, 1890, [...] "she spoke of her will, and of leaving {{something}} for the boy. I asked, 'Which one?' She said, 'The youngest, I suppose.' Then, after a while, she said, 'Do you think that beautiful boy that I fell so much in love with would like his share?' Just before she fell asleep she said, 'Do you <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Sanborn will be pleased that the wonderful child has his rights?' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Benny's long radio {{career began}} on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned {{him for the}} N.W. Ayer agency and their client, Canada Dry, after which Bertha Brainard, head of the division, said, [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Benny is {{excellent}} for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe {{he would make a}} great bet for an air program." [...] Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and [...] "the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale heard me and offered me a job." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the verdict}} was read to the court, Denis Collins, {{a member of the}} jury and a {{journalist}} who has written for The Washington Post and other newspapers, spoke to the press. According to Collins, some in the jury felt sympathy for Libby and believed he was only the [...] "fall guy". Collins said that [...] "a number of times" [...] the jurors asked themselves, [...] "what is [...] doing here? Where is Rove and all these other guys. I'm not saying we didn't <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of. It seemed like he was, as Mr. Wells [...] put it, he was the fall guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Magnolia {{struggled}} {{at the box}} office, it was well-received critically. [...] it has an 84% [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes, {{based on}} 118 [...] "fresh" [...] reviews out of 141. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "the most imperfect of the year's best movies". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert praised the film, saying: [...] "Magnolia {{is the kind of}} film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating, praising Cruise's performance: [...] "It's with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of Eyes Wide Shut ... Like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business". The Independent said that the film was [...] "limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. Magnolia does not have the last word on anything. But is superb". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Tom Cruise's performance: [...] "Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It's great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "In the case of Magnolia, I <b>think</b> <b>Mr.</b> Anderson has taken us to the water's edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, 'You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs'." ...|$|E
