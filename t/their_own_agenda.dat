5|$|The Dutch East India Company {{had founded}} the Cape Colony on the {{southern}} tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).|$|E

Under this proposed plan, municipalities had to work in conjunction with the state government and other municipalities to guarantee uniformity; municipalities would be allowed to exercise certain authorities and regulations without approvals from the state. Grupo Garza Ponce stated that the problem was that each municipality in the state had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> for urban planning.|$|E

25|$|Kongo {{began working}} towards a Spanish alliance, {{especially}} following António I's succession as king in 1661. Although {{it is not}} clear what diplomatic activities he engaged in with Spain itself, the Portuguese clearly believed that he hoped to repeat the Dutch invasion, this time with the assistance of Spain. António sent emissaries to the Dembos region and to Matamba and Mbwila, attempting to form a new anti-Portuguese alliance. The Portuguese had been troubled, moreover, by Kongo support of runaway slaves, who flocked to southern Kongo throughout the 1650s. At the same time, the Portuguese were advancing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> for Mbwila, which they claimed as a vassal. In 1665, both sides invaded Mbwila, and their rival armies met each other at Ulanga, in the valley below Mbanza Mbwila, capital of the district.|$|E
25|$|The Charlottetown Conference, {{as it came}} to be called, {{was also}} {{attended}} by a slew of visiting delegates from the neighbouring colony of Canada, who had largely arrived at their own invitation with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda.</b> This agenda saw the conference dominated by discussions of creating an even larger union of the entire territory of British North America into a united colony. The Charlottetown Conference ended with an agreement to meet the following month in Quebec City, where more formal discussions ensued, culminating with meetings in London and the signing of the British North America Act. Of the Maritime provinces, only Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were initially party to the BNA Act, Prince Edward Island's reluctance, combined with a booming agricultural and fishing export economy having led to that colony opting not to sign on.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremony}} in Compostela was more symbolic than effective, and Diego Gelmírez, Pedro Fróilaz, and other Galician nobles headed first to Lugo, {{and later to}} the royal seat in León to enthrone Alfonso VII there. However, they were intercepted at Viadangos, near León, by the troops of Alfonso the Battler. The Galician knights charged, but they were outnumbered and surrounded by the Aragonese infantry, who defeated the Galicians and frustrated their plans. Pedro Fróilaz was taken prisoner, whilst other nobles were killed, but bishop Gelmírez managed to escape, delivering his protégé, the young king, to his mother, who began acting against her new husband. From then until Alfonso VII came of age and Urraca died, the entire realm lived under {{a constant state of}} civil war, experiencing frequent seizures and shifting alliances between mother and child, and between Urraca and her Aragonese husband. This same civil war was evident in the kingdom of Galicia, were partisans of Diego Gelmirez, of Pedro Fróilaz, and of other nobles and warlords, found themselves battling each other either as defenders of either Queen Urraca or King Alfonso VII, or under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda,</b> whilst Alfonso of Aragón and Theresa of Portugal also had their own supporters.|$|E

2500|$|The melody of the Wilhelmus was {{borrowed}} from a well known Roman Catholic French song titled [...] "" [...] or in short: [...] "Chartres". This song ridiculed the failed Siege of Chartres in 1568 by the Huguenot (Protestant) Prince de Condé during the French Wars of Religion. However, the triumphant {{contents of the}} Wilhelmus {{is the opposite of}} the content of the original song, making it subversive at several levels. Thus, the Dutch Protestants had taken over an anti-Protestant song, and adapted it into propaganda for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda.</b> In that way, the Wilhelmus was typical for its time, since It was common practice in the 16th century for warring groups to steal each other's songs in order to rewrite them.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Ice Cube formed Westside Connection with Mack 10 and WC, and {{together}} they released an album called Bow Down.

The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified Platinum by the end of 1996. With Bow Down, Westside Connection brought <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round" [...] make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with Eazy-E shortly before his death in March 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the Middle Ages, {{the city}} paid tribute, {{protection}} money or [...] "black rent" [...] to the neighbouring Irish clans to avoid their predatory raids. In 1315, a Scottish army under Edward the Bruce burned the city's suburbs. As English interest in maintaining their Irish colony waned, the defence of Dublin {{from the surrounding}} Irish was left to the Fitzgerald Earls of Kildare, who dominated Irish politics until the 16th century. However, this dynasty often pursued <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda.</b> In 1487, during the English Wars of the Roses, the Fitzgeralds occupied the city {{with the aid of}} troops from Burgundy and proclaimed the Yorkist Lambert Simnel to be King of England. In 1537, the same dynasty, led by Silken Thomas, who was angry at the imprisonment of Garret Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, besieged Dublin Castle.

2500|$|In December 1997, Cohen's {{book was}} {{reviewed}} by Professor Charles W. Ingrao of Purdue University's History Department in Nationalities Papers. Ingrao described {{the book as}} a [...] "well-written, heavily footnoted narration" [...] which [...] "details {{the degree to which}} the Serbs of what is today Rump-Yugoslavia collaborated with the Nazis, both before and immediately after the April 1941 German invasion". He noted that, [...] "It is difficult to refute his contention that it was the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Jews of multiethnic Bosnia and the Krajina that provided the backbone to the anti-fascist war effort at a time when both the Četniks and Nedić regimes of Serbia were pursuing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia". Ingrao observed that while scholars were already familiar with a great deal of the material included in the book, Cohen's exposé on the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society founded by Slobodan Milošević was new evidence about an organisation that was used to convince the international community of the common bond between Serbs and Jews. Ingrao concluded that, while Cohen overplayed the evidence at a couple of points in the book, he was impressed by both its factual accuracy and balanced judgements.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question why}} Fertig {{did not receive}} the Medal of Honor, despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life. Others question why, when Fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas, he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men, who were never in combat, received that rank as the U.S. Army grew in size. William Manchester, in his 1978 biography of MacArthur, American Caesar, offers the opinion that MacArthur and his staff may have had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda</b> in minimizing the efforts of Fertig, other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the Philippines. For example, The American Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized General MacArthur to liberate the island of Luzon, {{but none of the}} other Philippine islands. After capturing Luzon, MacArthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization, and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the Joint Chiefs. Manchester stated, [...] "He [...] wanted to become the liberator of the Philippines." [...] The Japanese Army's practice of referring to Fertig as [...] "Major General Fertig, Commander in Chief in the Philippines" [...] throughout the occupation period and its use of Japanese military notation in referring to the 10th Military District as the [...] "10 Army Group" [...] did not endear Fertig to MacArthur's headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{speculate that}} maaser sheni {{developed as a}} tribute to the king; the Books of Samuel mention that the Israelites were ordered by Samuel (speaking on behalf of God) to give a tenth of everything to the king, seemingly referring to such a tribute in a passage (1 Samuel 8:15) which textual scholars believe belongs to the monarchial source, and predates both the Priestly Code and the Deuteronomic Code. [...] This is in contrast to the reading of the text which was a warning by Samuel to the Children of Israel about the abuses of power that a king may impose. There is no example of an Israelite king actually imposing such a 10% tax. Further, ma'aser sheni was retained for consumption by the farmer who produced the crop or redeemed by said farmer for money to be used by him and his family. Some scholars speculate that these tributes began to be used for public festivals, often including religious ones, and thus gradually came to be seen as associated with the priests. Once again, this is unlikely as the Levites who received ma'aser rishon were not priests (called [...] "kohanim"). The kohanim received terumah and terumat ma'aser from the Leviim, not ma'aser rishon, as would be thought if they had written the Torah to enhance <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>agenda.</b> Moreover, {{this has nothing to do}} with ma'aser sheni, which, once again, was retained by the farmer who was liable to separate the tithe.|$|E
