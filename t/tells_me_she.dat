Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a [...] quadrant {{north and west}} of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5million) and found nothing. The search locations were derived from the line of position (157–337) broadcast by Earhart on July 2, 1937. Nevertheless, Elgen Long's interpretations have led Jourdan to conclude, [...] "The analysis of all the data we have – the fuel analysis, the radio calls, other things – <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> went into the water off Howland." [...] Earhart's stepson George Palmer Putnam Jr. has {{been quoted as saying}} he believes [...] "the plane just ran out of gas". Susan Butler, author of the Earhart biography East to the Dawn, says she thinks the aircraft went into the ocean out of sight of Howland Island and rests on the seafloor at a depth of [...] Tom D. Crouch, Senior Curator of the National Air and Space Museum, has said the Earhart/Noonan Electra is [...] "18,000 ft. down" [...] and may even yield a range of artifacts that could rival the finds of the Titanic, adding that [...] "the mystery is part of what keeps us interested. In part, we remember her because she's our favorite missing person." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{expect the}} fact is, you haven't time," [...] he said; [...] "You're always about with June. I expect you're useful {{to her with}} her young man, chaperoning, and one thing and another. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> never at home now; your Uncle Jolyon he doesn't like it, I fancy, being left so much alone as he is. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> always hanging about for this young Bosinney; I suppose he comes here every day. Now, {{what do you think}} of him? D'you think he knows his own mind? He seems to me a poor thing. I should say the grey mare was the better horse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{promise is}} a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would. If not, {{it is not}} for me to force her confidence. But I am {{justified}} in taking my own line--and I will." ...|$|R
