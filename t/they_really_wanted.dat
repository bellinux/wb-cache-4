5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking {{the essence of the}} band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, {{it would be great to}} see what we could do together. And <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger as a starting point for that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
500|$|As a music venue, the Buenavista Social Club {{experienced}} {{the peak of}} Havana's nightclub life, when charangas and conjuntos, played several sets every night, going from club to club {{over the course of}} a week. Often, bands would dedicate songs to the clubs were the played. In the case of the Buenavista Social Club, an eponymous danzón was composed by Israel López [...] "Cachao" [...] in 1938, and performed with Arcaño y sus Maravillas. In addition, Arsenio Rodríguez dedicated [...] "Buenavista en guaguancó" [...] to the same place. Together with Orquesta Melodías del 40, the Maravillas and Arsenio's conjunto were known as Los Tres Grandes (The Big Three), drawing the largest audiences wherever they played. This vibrant times in Havana were described by pianist Rubén González, who played in Arsenio's conjunto, as [...] "an era of real musical life in Cuba, when there was very little money to earn, but everyone played because <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to".|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what we heard from doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to.|$|E

500|$|Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear {{began to}} pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 {{to the major}} film studios but were turned down. [...] "This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or {{anything}} similar", Stevens explained. [...] "In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly {{announced}} that Wright {{was leaving the}} project due to [...] "differences in their vision of the film", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On the split, Wright said, [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} Marvel movie but I don’t think <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to make an Edgar Wright movie." [...] He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which was [...] "a tough thing to move forward" [...] as Wright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued, [...] "Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really." [...] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project {{in the wake of his}} departure. By May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright, but pulled out of negotiations the next day. On June 7, Marvel {{announced that}} Peyton Reed would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script. Other directors that had been under consideration include Ruben Fleischer, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Nicholas Stoller, Michael Dowse, and David Wain.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Sinatra {{released}} Watertown, one of {{his most}} acclaimed concept albums, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse me while I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like the first thing is not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign.

500|$|In 405 BC, the Athenian navy was {{defeated}} and {{destroyed by the}} Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander at the Battle of Aegospotami in the Hellespont. Without sufficient funds to build another fleet, the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city. Blockaded by land and sea, with their food supplies running low, the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis, whose army was camped outside their walls, offering to join the Spartan alliance if {{they were allowed to}} keep their walls and port; Agis, claiming that he had no power to negotiate, sent the ambassadors on to Sparta, but there they were told that, if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> peace, they should bring the Spartans better proposals. The Athenians were initially intransigent, {{going so far as to}} imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted, but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises. In this situation, Theramenes, in a speech to the assembly, requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander (who was at this time besieging Samos) to determine the Spartans' intentions towards Athens; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians' situation, although he declined to share it with the citizenry. His request was granted, and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander; from there, he was sent to Sparta, perhaps stopping at Athens on the way. At Sparta, with representatives of all of Sparta's allies present, Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down, the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited, and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use [...] "the constitution of their ancestors". Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly; although some still favored holding out, the majority voted to accept the terms; the Peloponnesian War, after 28 years, was at an end.|$|E

2500|$|While guitars {{have been}} (minimally) present {{even in their}} early work, their {{appearance}} in the final mix has always been very slight, and even today that Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as {{to be more than}} barely noticed.

Bob told me <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E
2500|$|After other interventions, for {{and against}} the OdG, Mussolini spoke again, and told the {{participants}} {{to reflect on their}} decision, since the approval of Grandi's OdG would imply the end of Fascism. He also cautioned against the illusion that the Anglo-Americans would be content with that, whereas what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> was the end of Italy, which under his rule had become too strong. For him, he said, this was not about his own person: at sixty, he could have ended that “beautiful adventure” that his life had been so far. But he was sure that the war could be won: in fact, he had a [...] "key" [...] to accomplish that, but he could not disclose it. He was not willing to let his throat be cut by the King. If, on the other hand, the King would re-confirm his trust in him, the consequences for the supporters of Grandi’s OdG would be dire. At the end of his speech many of the gerarchi were visibly shaken. Grandi, jumping again from his chair, screamed that the Duce with his last words was blackmailing all of them; but, he added, if one must choose between fidelity to him and loyalty to the homeland, the choice was clear. At this point Mussolini gave the word to Scorza, who caught everyone by surprise by presenting his own OdG.
