5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely collected, and prices for rare dates remain low {{by the standards of}} American collectible coinage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether John {{tried to kill}} Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered {{to prove that the}} officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Brahmi was likely derived from or {{influenced by a}} Semitic script model, with Aramaic being a leading candidate. However, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> settled {{due to the lack}} of direct evidence and unexplained differences between Aramaic, Kharoṣṭhī, and Brahmi. Virtually all authors accept that regardless of the origins, the degree of Indian development of the Brahmi script in both the graphic form and the structure has been extensive. It is also widely accepted that theories about the grammar of the Vedic language probably had a strong influence on this development. Some authors – both Western and Indian – suggest that Brahmi was borrowed or inspired by a Semitic script, invented in a short few years during the reign of Ashoka and then used widely for Ashokan inscriptions. In contrast, some authors reject the idea of foreign influence.|$|E
25|$|Though his {{paternal}} ancestors remained {{loyal to}} the Isabelinos, it was Enrique’s mother who influenced him towards Carlism, the leaning reinforced during the university years. According to himself always a Carlist, he joined the movement in 1869, the same year founding also the affiliated Juventud Catolica. As conde de Villalobos he unsuccessfully ran for the Cortes in 1871 from Ciudad Rodrigo, but obtained the mandate in the successive elections of 1872 from Ledesma. His service lasted only 2 months, since before the planned insurgency the claimant ordered his deputies to resign. There {{is no evidence that}} Enrique de Aguilera took part in the Third Carlist War and that he was exiled, though <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> entirely clear. In 1876 in Paris, already as marqués, he was introduced to Carlos VII. The two developed cordial relationship bordering personal friendship; de Cerralbo turned out - along Solferino - one of two grandees who sided with Carlism and automatically became one of its most distinguished figures.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test {{is inappropriate}} where <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the existence of}} discriminatory classification in a statute, but discriminatory application of a neutral statute. [...] This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test {{as the answer to}} whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons (stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test) will always be in the negative. In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test, holding that [...] "he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".|$|E

500|$|As {{described}} above, {{there are}} arguments about whether {{these and other}} early bands truly qualify as [...] "heavy metal" [...] or simply as [...] "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, [...] "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, [...] "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... were a rock 'n' roll band that {{just happened to be}} heavy enough for metal". <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band [...] "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, {{and then we got}} some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them.

500|$|Defenders of {{the current}} usage often state their {{intention}} to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders {{of the status quo}} also state that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than [...] "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Although there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 {{slideshow}} Conflicts of Interest, [...] Emanuel {{said that}} there were conflicts of interest between a physician's primary responsibilities [...] (providing optimal care for patients, promoting patient safety and public health) and a physician's secondary interests (publishing, educating, obtaining research funding, obtaining a good income and political activism). Emanuel said that while {{it is difficult to know}} when conflicts of interest exist, the fact that they do is [...] "the truth". When there is no doubt of a conflict, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a mere conflict of interest, but fraud.|$|E
2500|$|Guildford is {{sometimes}} {{described as the}} county town of Surrey, {{but it is not}} clear whether this is the case or not. [...] <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> made easier because sources disagree over the definition of a county town. [...] Most sources state that the county town is the administrative centre for the county, but local government undergoes frequent reorganisation and what was once the county town may no longer be the administrative centre. [...] Surrey County Council has no administrative presence in Guildford but is located at Kingston upon Thames, which became part of Greater London in the 1960s, though the above cite claims Guildford as the county town.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{analysed}} {{the role}} of terrorism in the novel. Patrick Reilly calls the novel [...] "a terrorist text {{as well as a}} text about terrorism" [...] due to Conrad's manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.|$|E

50|$|H. F. Helmolt {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> so much <b>the</b> debt per se, {{but the way}} the debt was refracted {{through the lens of}} Enlightenment {{principles}} and the increasing power of third-estate creditors, that is, commoners who held the government's paper.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{groups have}} great ideological, political, financial, and {{emotional}} investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws {{have a vested}} interest in showing that [...] "their" [...] laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other side of the issue, low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage. The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always based on dispassionate analysis. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} reform {{met with}} opposition {{not because it}} would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, {{but because of the}} impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much {{power in the hands of}} the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. [...] Lord Patten of Barnes has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance it will be more difficult to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood has stated that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> [...] "whether there has to be change, but what kind of change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{does not}} believe the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks were a {{government}} conspiracy and has explicitly denied being a 9/11 [...] "truther", arguing that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a conspiracy but a failure of bureaucracy. He believes the 9/11 Commission Report's main goal was [...] "to protect the government and to protect their ineptness—not [...] to do this so they can use this {{as an excuse to}} spread the war [...] Some who did want to spread the war would use it as an opportunity. But, it wasn't something that was deliberately done." [...] He does not think the government would have staged such an attack. When asked whether [...] "9/11 was orchestrated by the government", Paul responded, [...] "Absolutely not." [...] Paul has stated that he is concerned that someone might create a [...] "contrived Gulf of Tonkin-type incident" [...] to justify the invasion of Iran or suspend the democratic process, adding, [...] "Let's hope I'm wrong about this one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Motorists {{occasionally}} pump gasoline into {{a diesel}} car by accident. [...] The converse {{is almost impossible}} because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of [...] which does not fit the [...] filler, and the nozzles are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to [...] "thin" [...] diesel fuel in winter.|$|E
2500|$|Forrest also {{rejected}} the US government's position that federal courts should provide habeas corpus, rather than judicial, review to military detainees as [...] "without merit" [...] and [...] "dangerous". The government argued that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the court's business and that courts could consider individual habeas corpus petitions from prisoners {{who have been}} detained. [...] "That argument is without merit and, indeed, dangerous," [...] wrote Judge Forrest. [...] "Habeas petitions (which take years to be resolved following initial detention) are reviewed under a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard (versus the criminal standard of `beyond a reasonable doubt') by a single judge in a civil proceeding, not a jury of twelve citizens in a criminal proceeding which can only return a guilty verdict if unanimous." [...] "If only habeas review is available to those detained…even U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, core constitutional rights available in criminal matters would simply be eliminated," [...] she wrote. [...] "No court can accept this proposition and adhere truthfully to its oath." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, [...] "right-wing" [...] is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} laissez-faire capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism {{can be traced to}} the late 19th century. The so-called neoliberal Right, popularized by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity. Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralized economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked. Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism [...] "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations". Gregory holds that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> right or left, but [...] "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal".|$|E
