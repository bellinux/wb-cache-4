5000|$|The Government Accountability Office {{has found}} that this law authorizes the ONDCP to {{disseminate}} information in order to oppose legalization:Finally, apart from considerations of whether any particular law has been violated, you have asked whether <b>the</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> letter disseminated misleading information in connection with statements relating to the debate over legalization of marijuana. Clearly, <b>the</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> statements reflect one perspective regarding marijuana - a perspective that is disputed by others with different viewpoints. However, ONDCP is specifically charged with the responsibility for [...] "taking such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use" [...] of certain controlled substances such as marijuana - a responsibility which logically could include the making of advocacy statements in opposition to legalization efforts. <b>The</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> statements about marijuana are thus within the statutory role assigned to ONDCP. Given this role, {{we do not see}} a need to examine the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> individual statements in detail.|$|R

5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), <b>the</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>director</b> {{of the parks}} and {{recreation}} department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Capelle, <b>the</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>director</b> of the Reichsmarineamt, {{stated that}} by mid November 1906, the testing for the {{underwater}} protection designs would be complete. He {{suggested that if}} the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, {{even if it meant}} increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
