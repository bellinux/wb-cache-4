50|$|These {{theories}} {{refer to}} the unusual biochemical properties that HLA-B27 has. The misfolding hypothesis suggests that slow folding during HLA-B27's tertiary structure folding and association with β2 microglobulin causes the protein to be misfolded, therefore initiating the unfolded protein response (UPR) - a pro-inflammatory endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. However, although this mechanism has been demonstrated both in vitro and in animals, {{there is little evidence}} of its occurrence in human spondyloarthritis. Also, the HLA-B27 heavy chain homodimer formation hypothesis suggests that B27 heavy chains tend <b>to</b> <b>dimerise</b> and accumulate in the ER, once again, initiating the UPR. Alternatively, cell surface B27 heavy chains and dimers can bind to regulatory immune receptors such as members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor family, promoting the survival and differentiation of pro-inflammatory leukocytes in disease.|$|E
