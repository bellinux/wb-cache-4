5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been passed by the General Assembly {{and sent to the}} voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Book Three {{shows the}} {{characters}} {{in the aftermath of the}} fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of the things <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been.|$|E

60|$|Coningsby {{began to}} talk about the wonders of the factory, but Mr. Millbank recurred to other {{thoughts}} that were passing in his mind. He spoke of his son: he expressed a kind reproach that Coningsby should have thought of visiting {{this part of the world}} without giving them some notice of his intention, <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been their guest, <b>that</b> Oswald <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been there to receive him, <b>that</b> they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> made arrangements <b>that</b> he should see everything, and in the best manner; in short, <b>that</b> they <b>might</b> all <b>have</b> shown, however slightly, the deep sense of their obligations to him.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been far more costly {{if he had not}} learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been overlooked. Differences {{in the soil}} can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E

Some scholars suppose <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been tribune of the plebs, but Niebuhr proposes <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the consul Maenius, whose high reputation <b>might</b> <b>have</b> secured the passage of such a law in his old age.|$|R

5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E

5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of wooden poles <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> served as markers or supported wooden structures within the graves. This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population of the occupied territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{survivors}} were suitably honoured {{on their}} return, with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel. In {{place of the}} knighthood <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been her husband's had he survived, Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In 1922, she married Edward Hilton Young, later Lord Kennet (rendering her Lady Kennet), and remained a doughty defender of Scott's reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been made in the}} 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|The strikers {{have gained}} {{absolutely}} nothing by the movement. The ten per cent reduction has been {{enforced by the}} four trunk lines, and the only concessions were those <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been had for asking, without {{the loss of a}} single day's work. Such of the strikers as were caught committing criminal acts are now under arrest, and the great majority of the rest are most anxious to resume their places. Some of the railroad companies have discharged every man that took part in the strike, while others have only dropped the ringleaders, and have held out inducements to the others to return to work.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
