40|$|Abstract- The {{answer to}} the {{question}} posed in the title depends on which model of local government behavior is operative. If it is the median-voter/benevolent-dictator model, then property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> can only be for evil. If it is the Leviathan/budget-maximizing-bureaucratic model, then property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> have the potential to improve the welfare of local resident voters. From this perspective, I reassess the empirical literature on state-imposed limits on local property taxes and conclude that the evidence can be interpreted as supportive of the notion that the Leviathan model may be operative and thus that property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> have the potential to improve welfare. The legacy of Proposition 13 certainly includes harmfuleffects in California as documented in this Forum by Downes and Figlio (1999) with regard to school districts and by, Sexton, Sheffrin, and O’Sullivan (1999) with respect to horizontal inequities in tax burdens.

40|$|Property tax limitations, as well {{as other}} tax and {{expenditure}} restrictions on state and local governments in the United States, date back to the late nineteenth century. A surge in property tax limitation legislation occurred in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and its effects on government revenue, school financing, and educational quality have been studied extensively. However, there is surprisingly little literature on how property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> affect housing markets. For the first time, we examine the impacts of property tax limitations on housing growth, in addition to their impacts on housing prices. Using state-level data over twenty-three years, we find that property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> increase housing prices (indexes) by approximately 1. 6 %. These limits appear to have little impact on the growth in the housing stock, as measured by the number of permits. Our evidence suggests that this is because while property <b>tax</b> <b>limits</b> reduce property <b>taxes</b> they also increase the price of housing. These two counteracting effects lead to ambiguous impacts on the gross price of housing. ...|$|R
