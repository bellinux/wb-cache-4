5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{wireless}} systems are commonly used: FM, audio induction loop, and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM {{systems can be}} battery operated or plugged into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them {{to be used in}} mobile situations. The audio induction loop permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a [...] "telecoil". If the listener does not have a <b>telecoil,</b> then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the infrared (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly into it.|$|E
5000|$|In the ear aids (ITE) devices fit in {{the outer}} ear bowl (called the concha). Being larger, these are easier to insert and can hold extra features. They are {{sometimes}} visible when standing {{face to face with}} someone. ITE hearing aids are custom made to fit each individual's ear. They can be used in mild to some severe hearing losses. Feedback, a squealing/whistling caused by sound (particularly high frequency sound) leaking and being amplified again, may be a problem for severe hearing losses. Some modern circuits are able to provide feedback regulation or cancellation to assist with this.Venting may also cause feedback. A [...] is a tube primarily placed to offer pressure equalization. However, different vent styles and sizes can be used to influence and prevent feedback.Traditionally, ITEs have not been recommended for young children because their fit could not be as easily modified as the earmold for a BTE, and thus the aid had to be replaced frequently as the child grew. However, there are new ITEs made from a silicone type material that mitigates the need for costly replacements.ITE hearing aids can be connected wirelessly to FM systems, for instance with a body-worn FM receiver with induction neck-loop which transmits the audio signal from the FM transmitter inductively to the <b>telecoil</b> inside the hearing instrument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Audible {{interference}} from digital cellular tele-phones (cell phones) {{has been a}} long standing problem for hearing aid users. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has lifted the hearing aid compatibility exception on cell phones and imposed a set of requirements effective September 2005. We conducted an experiment to determine how well hearing aid wearers are able to use commercially available dig-ital cell phones. Hearing aid users evaluated the usability of six digital cellular handsets. The results suggest that certain trans-mission technologies create more annoyance from interference than others and that the type of hearing aid-to-telephone cou-pling (microphone or <b>telecoil)</b> can influence a user’s experi-ence of interference. However, the results also suggest that interference alone does not fully predict the usability of a cell phone for hearing aid users. These findings have implications for the American National Standards Institute C 63. 19 test and measurement standard that is used to rate cell phones ’ compli-ance with the FCC ruling and the education of consumers with regard to their expectations for cell phone use.

40|$|Assistive {{listening}} devices (ALDs) {{are used}} in classrooms to assist communication for students with hearing loss. An ALD, a system of external microphones, transmits sound directly to the students' hearing aids. The signal is coupled to the hearing aid using a radio frequency (FM) or an induction loop (IL) system. Using a switch on the hearing aid, the students can listen to the signal from the hearing aid microphone or the ALD signal received by a FM-receiver or a <b>telecoil.</b> An interest in the impact of ALD solutions on student communication and interaction prompted the work reported in this thesis. The thesis evaluates how the quality of classroom ALDs can be optimized {{in terms of the}} concept communication acoustics. Aspects of room acoustics, sound quality, and binaural hearing were explored. The methodical approach was based on self-assessment using questionnaires, interviews and listening tests. The empirical data in Paper I, II, and III consisted of responses from 25 students (10 - 20 years old) who were attending classes for the hard-of-hearing. In Paper I, the hearing aid microphone (M) and <b>telecoil</b> (T) mode were assessed using a questionnaire. When the hearing aid was in T mode, audibility increased: speech intelligibility was improved and less listening effort was required. Better awareness was achieved using M mode. The students could better hear sounds in the environment around them and participate in conversations - classified as non-teaching - when the ALD was not used. An important feature of sound quality was the distinction of sounds, which is the ability to recognize additional characteristics of a speech sample, e. g., the ability to identify students by voice and judge the mood of students from their voice. Hearing aids also offer a combined mode where the signals from the internal microphone and the telecoil/FM are mixed. In Paper II, different hearing aid mode combinations were assessed using a combined approach where the different combinations were self-rated in a questionnaire and compared in a listening test. The result supports the finding that a combination of M and T mode is a feasible compromise between audibility and awareness. The students were active in their use of different hearing aid modes and aware of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the alternatives. The hearing strategies varied in different classroom settings and for different degrees of hearing loss, findings that emphasize the importance of individual adjustments. In Paper III, binaural aspects of hearing and ALDs were assessed in a listening test. A binaural model was compared to an omni-directional microphone. No advantage in speech intelligibility and listening effort was found using a binaural ALD. ALD design and characteristics can be evaluated using room acoustic modelling and auralization in different room acoustic conditions. In Paper IV and V, auralization and binaural reproduction techniques used in Paper II and III were investigated. Aspects of binaural and spatial hearing were assessed in normal-hearing subjects. Auralization is a reliable method to render a binaural listening experience in a classroom environment: the performance was equal to that of using artificial head recordings. The method used for binaural reproduction - a two-loudspeaker cross-talk cancellation system - introduces distortion in reproduced interaural differences. The binaural advantages in speech intelligibility were reduced when compared to headphone reproduction. The interaural differences were sufficiently reproduced in the frequency region of ALDs (300 - 4 k Hz); the use of cross-talk cancellation for hearing aid and ALD evaluation is to be further studied. High sound quality matches students' expectations and demands. To take an active part in the communication in the classroom, students expect to hear sounds in the classroom that they perceive as adequate. However, the students with hearing loss required speech signals with significantly reduced noise and competing speech levels. Today, students have to make a compromise between audibility and awareness. Any alternative, however, could make communication in the classroom difficult. Different classroom settings and sound environments as well as individual factors of preference and degree of hearing loss affect their decision.
