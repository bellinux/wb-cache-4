2500|$|While {{working on}} A Girl like Me, Rihanna not only {{recorded}} songs but also promoted Music of the Sun. She commented: [...] "We were so busy promoting the first album while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> one done, working some crazy hours. That's why this album {{is so close}} to me, 'cause I really put my heart and soul into it." [...] "SOS" [...] was the first recorded track for the album, a song which was originally intended for Christina Milian's third studio album So Amazin'; however, she rejected it. L.A. Reid had Rihanna in mind as the next artist to record the song. The song was recorded within three days and eventually later released as the lead single from A Girl like Me. [...] "Kisses Don't Lie" [...] was penned and produced by Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken {{and it was one of}} the three songs on the album on which Rihanna received writing credit. The song was written and recorded in Barbados, and was described by Rihanna as mashed up rock and reggae.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's simply your old-fashioned {{masculine}} {{attitude toward}} the female, Mr. Marson. You look on woman as a weak creature, to be shielded and petted. We aren't anything of the sort. We're terrors! We're as hard as nails. We're awful creatures. You mustn't let my sex interfere with your <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> reward.

6000|$|... "I was {{knocking}} the balls about," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> miserable {{business of the}} Diamond out of my mind. I happened to look up--and there stood Rosanna Spearman {{at the side of}} me, like a ghost! Her stealing on me in that way was so strange, that I hardly knew what to do at first. Seeing a very anxious expression in her face, I asked her if she wished to speak to me. She answered, 'Yes, if I dare.' Knowing what suspicion attached to her, I could only put one construction on such language as that. I confess it made me uncomfortable. I had no wish to invite the girl's confidence. At the same time, in the difficulties that now beset us, I could hardly feel justified in refusing to listen to her, if she was really bent on speaking to me. It was an awkward position; and I dare say I got out of it awkwardly enough. I said to her, 'I don't quite understand you. Is there anything you want me to do?' Mind, Betteredge, I didn't speak unkindly! The poor girl can't help being ugly--I felt that, at the time. The cue was still in my hand, and I went on {{knocking the}} balls about, to take off the awkwardness of the thing. As it turned out, I only made matters worse still. I'm afraid I mortified her without meaning it! She suddenly turned away. 'He looks at the billiard balls,' I heard her say. 'Anything rather than look at me!' Before I could stop her, she had left the hall. I am not quite easy about it, Betteredge. Would you mind telling Rosanna that I meant no unkindness? I have been a little hard on her, perhaps, in my own thoughts--I have almost hoped that the loss of the Diamond might be traced to her. Not from any ill-will to the poor girl: but----" [...] He stopped there, and going back to the billiard-table, began to knock the balls about once more.|$|E
6000|$|He {{satisfied}} the impassioned demand of his nature for incessant activities {{of every kind}} by taking a personal {{as well as a}} pecuniary interest in the inventions of others. At one moment [...] "the damned human race" [...] was almost to be redeemed by a process of founding brass without air bubbles in it; if this could once be accomplished, as I understood, or misunderstood, brass could be used in art-printing to a degree hitherto impossible. I dare say I have got it wrong, but I am not mistaken as to Clemens's enthusiasm for the process, and his heavy losses in paying its way to ultimate failure. He was simultaneously absorbed in the perfection of a type-setting machine, which he was paying the inventor a salary to bring to a perfection so expensive that it was practically impracticable. We were both printers by trade, and I could take the same interest in this wonderful piece of mechanism that he could; and it was so truly wonderful that it did everything but walk and talk. Its ingenious creator was so bent upon realizing the highest ideal in it that he produced a machine of quite unimpeachable efficiency. But it was so costly, when finished, that it could not be made for less than twenty thousand dollars, if the parts were made by hand. This sum was prohibitive of its introduction, unless the requisite capital could be found for making the parts by machinery, and Clemens spent many months in vainly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> money together. In the mean time simpler machines had been invented and the market filled, and his investment of three hundred thousand dollars in the beautiful miracle remained permanent but not profitable. I once went with him to witness its performance, and it did seem to me the last word in its way, but it had been spoken too exquisitely, too fastidiously. I never heard him devote the inventor to the infernal gods, as he was apt to do with the geniuses he lost money by, and so I think he did not regard him as a traitor.|$|E
60|$|You are surprised, perhaps, {{to hear me}} {{call this}} its main business. That is indeed so, however. The giving {{brightness}} to picture is much, but the giving brightness to life more. And remember, were it as patterns only, you cannot, without the realities, have the pictures. You cannot have a landscape by Turner, without a country for him to paint; you cannot have a portrait by Titian, without {{a man to be}} portrayed. I need not prove that to you, I suppose, in these short terms; but in the outcome I can get no soul to believe that the beginning of art is in getting our country clean, and our people beautiful. I have been ten years <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> very plain certainty--I do not say believed--but even thought of, as anything but a monstrous proposition. To get your country clean, and your people lovely;--I assure you that is a necessary work of art to begin with! There has indeed been art in countries where people lived in dirt to serve God, but never in countries where they lived in dirt to serve the devil. There has indeed been art where the people were not all lovely--where even their lips were thick--and their skins black, because the sun had looked upon them; but never {{in a country where the}} people were pale with miserable toil and deadly shade, and where the lips of youth, instead of being full with blood, were pinched by famine, or warped with poison. And now, therefore, note this well, the gist of all these long prefatory talks. I said that the two great moral instincts were those of Order and Kindness. Now, all the arts are founded on agriculture by the hand, and on the graces, and kindness of feeding, and dressing, and lodging your people. Greek art begins in the gardens of Alcinous--perfect order, leeks in beds, and fountains in pipes. And Christian art, as it arose out of chivalry, was only possible so far as chivalry compelled both kings and knights to care for the right personal training of their people; it perished utterly when those kings and knights became +dêmoboroi+, devourers of the people. And it will become possible again only, when, literally, the sword is beaten into the ploughshare, when your St. George of England shall justify his name, and Christian art shall be known as its Master was, in breaking of bread.|$|E

5000|$|Logano said {{in victory}} lane that his win [...] "feels so good. I've never felt this good about a win before.

5000|$|Forster was {{an early}} {{vigorous}} advocate of a ban on cockfighting in Louisiana.

[...] "We've been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> thing passed for years, and we'll probably try again ...," [...] Forster said.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{explains}} the inspiration behind the song by saying: [...] "A {{friend of mine}} was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> girl named Michelle," [...] said Johnson, [...] "and I tried to write a song that would help him have a laugh at himself because he was {{spending so much time}} trying to get her and it obviously wasn't leading anywhere.

60|$|But {{there was}} still one means of defence on which {{he thought he might}} rely to drive off the scoundrels.

50|$|Ogle's {{career as}} a servant of the crown began prior to his father's death. In 1434, he was a {{commissioner}} of the Truce with Scotland, {{and a year later}} appears to have been captain of Berwick Castle, which was worth circa £194 in peace time, with another £200 to be paid in time of war. It was in which post he was captured by the Scots, during a border raid, and ransomed for 750 marks. As the king traditionally paid the ransoms of thos captured on his service, Ogle applied for such; but the condition of the Lancastrian crown's finances at the time were such that he was still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> compensation seven years later.

5000|$|A {{new company}} Pacific Fibre {{proposed}} another international cable between New Zealand and the United States, with claims in 2011 {{by one of}} the proponents Sam Morgan that competition would cut international capacity costs, and result in more generous internet data caps.

5000|$|During {{this time}} {{tensions}} between Hindus and Muslims escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India.

[...] Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his Hindu friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of Pakistan and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} NDRE {{was working with}} Kongsberg for {{plans to build a}} {{computer}} for a field artillery system. Monrad-Krohn proposed that their company should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> contract, but after it was awarded to NDRE, they had increased difficulty finding investors. The company had estimated a need for NOK600,000. A founding meeting was held on 7 July 1967 with fifteen people present. The largest investor was Mosvold Shipping Group which invested NOK100,000, while remaining investors put in NOK94,000. The company was established as A/S Nordata – Norsk Data-Elektronikk. As [...] "Nordata" [...] was already registered by a company in Trondheim, the name was changed to A/S Norsk Data-Elektronikk on 20 July.|$|R
