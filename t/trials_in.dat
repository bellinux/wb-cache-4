5|$|In {{the second}} chapter, the book {{describes}} {{the process as}} new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 (first-in-man study), phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials.

Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical <b>trials</b> <b>in</b> India is 20 percent a year, in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while <b>trials</b> <b>in</b> the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent.|$|E
