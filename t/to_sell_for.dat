One of them was offered for auction through Sotheby's in late 2007 and was expected <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> £50,000 (US$77,000, €69,000); ultimately it was bought for £1.95million ($3million, €2.7million) by Amazon, making the selling price the highest achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript.

Two units sold for over $3million that month including a $3.99million sale, which was the highest sale price in the building since 2009. The penthouse sold for $17million in late 2014 to Sanjay Shah, the founder and CEO of Vistex.|$|E

5|$|According to gadget site Tom's Hardware, 3–4million {{units were}} {{expected}} to sell in 2012, which would account {{for most of the}} six million tablets Asus was expecting <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> the year. Other sources estimated that 6–8million units of the tablet would be shipped before the year's end. Google initially expected to sell 3million units of the Nexus7 by the end of 2012, but Forrester Research estimates that Google met this sales target in mid-October 2012. Asus CFO David Chang said that by October, sales of the Nexus7 had approached 1million units per month. In light of Google not releasing official sales figures, mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans estimated that the device most likely sold between 4.5 and 4.6million units in 2012. According to Carphone Warehouse, the Nexus7 is the UK retailer's highest-selling Android tablet.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed.|$|E

25|$|The great {{majority}} of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but {{a small number of}} species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make individual items unsuitable <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former {{executives}} at ABC, left the network {{to start their}} own production company. At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork & Mindy, Three's Company, and Welcome Back, Kotter. The two decided that {{in order to get a}} sitcom <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby, who, during the 1970s, starred in two failed sitcoms, produced award-winning stand up comedy albums, and had roles in several different films, was relatively quiet during the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{companion}} marque strategy, {{the gap between}} the Chevrolet and the Oakland would be filled by a new marque named Pontiac, a quality six-cylinder car designed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> the price of a four-cylinder. The wide gap between Oldsmobile and Buick would be filled by two companion marques: Oldsmobile was assigned the up-market V8 engine Viking and Buick was assigned the more compact six-cylinder Marquette. Cadillac, which had seen its base prices soar in the heady 1920s, was assigned the LaSalle as a companion marque to fill the gap that existed between it and Buick.|$|E

Edgar Dewdney, Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories moved the territorial capital from North Battleford to this yet featureless and barren site rather than the anticipated Qu'Appelle or Fort Qu'Appelle, having acquired substantial property on the site <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> profit.|$|E

25|$|Dionysus was {{exceptionally}} attractive. One of the Homeric hymns recounts how, while {{disguised as}} a mortal sitting beside the seashore, a few sailors spotted him, believing he was a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail him far away <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> ransom or into slavery. They tried to bind him with ropes, but no type of rope could hold him. Dionysus turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing those he came into contact with. Those who jumped off the ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} savagery {{of the murders}} and the {{precision}} of the eviscerations upon the victims' bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> transplant, {{the work of a}} Satanic cult, or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.|$|E
