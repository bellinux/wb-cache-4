A uniform description of <b>the</b> two <b>approaches</b> is given for this purpose. <b>The</b> two <b>approaches</b> {{turn out to}} be able to handle similar classes of theories in principle. However, theories are typically handled efficiently by one of <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> and inefficiently by the other. In this sense, <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> are complementary.

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> of a line of thunderstorms could indicate <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> to each airfield, one at Southall for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors.
