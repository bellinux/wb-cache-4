40|$|Directors of listed {{companies}} {{are seen as}} key individuals in the running of their organisations. The loss of a key individual could have {{significant effect on the}} profitability and sustainability of a <b>company.</b> <b>The</b> loss of such an individual could cause harm to the share price of an organisation, due to the instability that may exist in the immediate to short term period after the death of a director. The purpose of this research paper was to investigate the effect that the death of a director of a JSE listed <b>company</b> has on <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>share</b> price. <b>The</b> research aimed to identify whether an abnormal return was experienced prior to, or post the death of the director, and whether it could be possible to predict abnormal returns based on the death of directors. The research further aimed to identify whether a difference existed in the abnormal returns experienced after the death of a non-executive director as opposed to an executive director or whether this differed in the JSE <b>s</b> resource rich <b>companies</b> as opposed to non-resource <b>companies.</b> Ultimately, <b>the</b> research also tested the efficiency of the JSE as a market. The research study ultimately found that there is a statistically significant effect on share price following the death of a director. The magnitude of the effect differs based on a number of variables, including whether the director was independent or executive. Where a director was independent, a negative abnormal return was experienced. However, where a director was an executive director, a positive abnormal return was experienced. The magnitude of the effect also differed significantly between the resources and non-resource <b>companies</b> on <b>the</b> JSE. Evidence was observed in the analysis, in support of the literature review, which confirms that the death of a director leads to abnormal returns on the share price.

40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project <b>company,</b> as <b>the</b> borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> pledge <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than <b>the</b> project <b>company.</b> <b>The</b> project <b>company</b> would receive <b>the</b> right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> has is <b>the</b> turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> assets. <b>The</b> registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> to allow <b>the</b> constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> or <b>the</b> constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> or <b>the</b> construction <b>company</b> <b>s</b> assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> <b>The</b> shareholders of a project <b>company</b> usually pledge <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> board of directors may affect the decisions <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> makes and <b>the</b> claw back of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>s</b> pledge/mortgage agreements to <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> sponsors are unable to pledge <b>the</b> project <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> to <b>the</b> banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a <b>company</b> <b>s</b> assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project.

A case study has been conducted with a large brewery <b>company</b> as <b>the</b> case organization. We have been looking at the use of mobile ICT and how the sales consultants relate to the recently implemented mobile applications. The main research question is: How can mobile workers relate to recently implemented mobile ICT? In addition to this, there are three sub questions. Fourteen sales consultants have participated in this study. The focus has lied on their use of two J 2 ME-applications. The first application is a reporting tool for supporting <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>s</b> chain agreements, whereas the second is an application for ordering products using the mobile phone. The results from the study are presented in this thesis. The theoretical framework is based on CSCW and mobility theory. The study showed that the sales consultants approached and related differently towards the applications.

40|$|The {{opportunistic}} {{and efficiency}} {{views of the}} forecasts undertaken by managers are completely different. In the efficiency approach, {{it is believed that}} by providing accurate forecasts, management provides correct information to the market, thereby restricting them to do earnings management. Therefore forecasts are truthful. In contrast, the opportunistic view of forecasts is that management s forecasts consist of biased signals. Managers will use earnings and Forecasts Management (FM) as tools to create positive earnings surprises that will lead to temporary stock price appreciation or preventing stock price depreciation. This research shows that as indicated by <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> growth capabilities <b>the</b> Analysts Recommendations (AR) can explain the difference in behaviours of managers under these two views. This research highlights the managers decision in reporting pessimistic forecast to produce positive Forecasts Errors (FEs) when a <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> are recommended to sell (hereafter called sell companies), and generate optimistic forecast when a <b>company</b> <b>s</b> <b>shares</b> are recommended to buy (hereafter called buy companies). Previous researches show that buy (growth) companies conduct income increasing earnings management in order to meet forecasts and generate positive forecast Errors (FEs). This behavior however, is not inherent in sell (non-growth) companies. By referring to the existing framework in the literature, this research hypothesizes that since sell companies are pressured to avoid income increasing earnings management, they are more capable and inclined to pursue income decreasing FM in order to produce positive FEs. IV Using a sample of 2576 firm- years of companies that are listed on the NYSE on years 2009 and 2010, the study discovers that sell companies conduct income decreasing FM to produce positive FE. However, the frequency of positive FEs of sell companies is not higher than that of buy companies. In addition, in <b>the</b> sell <b>companies</b> group, <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> that have positive forecasts errors issue higher pessimistic forecasts. Such pessimistic forecasts lead to higher positive forecasts errors. However, in <b>the</b> buy <b>companies</b> group, <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> that have positive forecasts errors do not issue higher pessimistic forecasts. Such pessimistic forecasts do not lead to higher positive forecasts errors. Consistent with the efficiency perspective, the study suggests that even though buy and sell companies are highly motivated to avoid negative FEs, they exploit different but efficient strategies in order to meet their respective forecasts. The findings of this research adds to the previous researches by proving that not only <b>the</b> buy <b>companies</b> (which are supposed to be growth companies) engage in income increasing earnings management to realize positive forecast error, but sell (non-growth) companies engage in negative forecast management to accomplish similar goals. Furthermore, the findings help us understand the complexities behind informative and opportunistic forecasts that fit under efficiency versus opportunistic theories in the literature...|$|R
