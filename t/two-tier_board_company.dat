40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the optimal structure of {{board of directors}} in a …rm with ownership concentrated {{in the hands of}} a large shareholder who sits on the board. We focus our attention on the choice between one-tier board who performs all tasks and <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> where the management board is in charge of project selection and the supervisory board is in charge of monitoring. We consider the case in which the large shareholder sits on (and controls) the supervisory board but not the management board. We show that a two-tier structure can limit the interference of large shareholder and can restore manager’s incentive to exert e¤ort to become informed on new investment projects without reducing the large shareholder’s incentive to monitor the manager. This results in higher expected pro…ts in a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> than in one-tier board and the difference in pro…ts can be su¢ciently high to induce large shareholder to prefer a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> despite the fact that in this case the manager selects his preferred projects rather than the project preferred by large shareholder. The paper has interesting policy implications since it suggests that <b>two-tier</b> <b>boards</b> can be a valuable option in Continental Europe where ownership structure is concentrated. It also o¤ers support to some recent corporate governance reforms, like the so-called Vietti reform in Italy, that have introduced the possibility to choose between one-tier and <b>two-tier</b> structure of <b>boards</b> for listed …rms...|$|R

The paper is aimed to determine the pragmatic and applicable one-tier and <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> models for integrating stakeholders as board directors in multinational corporations. It begins with discussing why multinational corporations need to concern on stakeholders’ interest and analysing different theoretical approaches for linking board composition with financial performance and corporate social performance. It will then review corporate governance frameworks integrating stakeholders’ engagement in various jurisdictions and economic status (i. e. emerging markets and developed markets). Finally, pragmatic multi-stakeholder board models for one-tier and <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> structures will be proposed through defining board composition, CEO duality and mechanism to resolve disputes arise from board members. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some {{interesting}} recent corporate governance developments in Germany. The focus is in particular on the German Corporate Governance Code, its parts, layout {{and how it}} deals with the various organs of German public corporations. The German Code is quite unique since it applies a Code of Good Practice to a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system, thus making it necessary {{to deal with the}} role and functions and the relationship between the management and the supervisory board. This paper concludes that several changes to the German law relating to public corporations since the middle of the 1990 s and the introduction of the German Code will ensure that the <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system will remain the favoured board structure for public corporations in Germany. It is, however, submitted that employee participation at supervisory board level will provide particular political challenges for Germany in the near future. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The 2003 Italian {{corporate}} law reform, which established one-tier and <b>two-tier</b> <b>boards</b> for listed and unlisted joint stock companies, introduced alternative corporate governance systems. In {{addition to the}} traditional model, which, at least in its basic features, continues {{to be used by}} the Italian legislator, the two “alternative” models of corporate governance generated by the 2003 reform differ in terms of their methods of appointment of managing and controlling bodies. Taking into account the surprisingly limited adoption of the new systems introduced by the reform after five years, this work implements regression analysis in order to compare the choice of corporate governance system in Italian unlisted firms: the corporations with best performances in terms of return of assets have continued to use the traditional system; moreover, firms with less concentrated ownership structure and the lowest proportion of individual shareholders have adopted a two-tier model. These findings support the preference of a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system for pyramidal structured companies hold by family groups...|$|R
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolState corporations are essential as they are mandated to provide public goods and services and cater to the general welfare of members of the public. State corporations in Kenya have served different purposes in different industries since their establishment during the colonial period. However, they have been plagued by a number of issues over the years, chief among them, mismanagement. Other issues that have arisen as a result of mismanagement include pilferage, wastage and bureaucracy. This has greatly undermined the achievement of their objectives. This paper seeks to investigate the suitability of applying the <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> structure to correct this corporate governance failure. The paper is anchored by the concept of governance and its important role in the management of a corporation. Corporate governance guidelines, frameworks and mechanisms are implemented to ensure that the management team of a corporation act and administer their duties in the interest of all stakeholders. With this in mind, the paper shall look into the state of state corporations in Kenya and the laws that govern their administration. It shall particularly look into the one-tier board structure, the rationale behind its use, its benefits and the shortcomings and how these shortcomings have undermined the activities of state corporations. The paper shall discuss the applicability of the <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> structure as a remedy to the corporate governance failures that plague state corporations. In order to do so, it shall delve into the application of the <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> structure in two jurisdictions; namely Germany and the Netherlands whose economic success can be partly attributed to the nature of their corporation laws.

40|$|In {{corporate}} governance systems boards perform three functions: the interlocking function (from a resource-dependency and network perspective), a monitoring function (from an agency perspective), and a strategic function (from a strategic choice perspective). In a one-tier board {{the board of}} directors incorporates non-executive directors (outsiders, they sometimes represent the interests of key-stakeholders) and executive directors (top management) of the firm. In a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> there is a clear distinction between the directors as members of a supervisory board and the top management team. The board serves in this respect as a supervisory board vis à vis the management board. In the Netherlands a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> is prevalent. Firms who act under the structural regime have boards that are characterized by the co-option principle. This means that board members have to act {{in the best interest of}} the firm and ultimately choose each other (and are not chosen by the shareholders or other stakeholders). Co-option has some advantages, but also some clear drawbacks, such as the potentiality of groupthink. The structural regime and other governance regimes, in which the relationship between supervisory board and management board is established, have moderating effects on the hypothesized relationships between the three functions and performance of firms. ...|$|R
40|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, serious financial scandals involving accounting irregularities in leading companies. While responses to these occurrences include the introduction of tougher regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), further serious instances have occurred, notably the 2008 subprime mortgage and financial institution meltdown. The existence and persistence of such cases of financial scandals have led many investors, regulators, companies and academics to try to reduce such incidence by improving the effectiveness of corporate governance and increasing awareness of the red flags which could cause accounting scandals. The relationship between individual corporate governance dimensions and corporate governance as a system orientated toward accounting irregularities has been tested. However, empirical measurements and tests are limited and largely based in one-tier board system environments. The outcomes are almost impossible to apply in <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> systems, where relationships between governance mechanisms and accounting irregularities are not fully understood. Using the agency theory and fraud theories, this research is undertaken in Indonesia to provide insights that extend the body {{of knowledge about the}} practices of the <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system.

The supervisory board plays a role in (anti-) investor protection in the Dutch corporate governance system. Therefore, we use indicators of corporate governance as instrumental variables. We find that the size of the management board is not determining firm performance. We do, however, find support for a negative relationship between the size and composition (number of outsiders) of the supervisory board and firm performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study explores how non-executive {{directors}} address governance {{problems on}} Dutch <b>two-tier</b> <b>boards.</b> Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address {{due to the}} formal separation of management boards’ decision-management from supervisory boards’ decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of <b>two-tier</b> <b>boards</b> in the Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and {{the management of the}} relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the ‘right’ board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom.

40|$|Lack of {{effective}} corporate governance mechanism and disclosure transparency frameworks have been partly {{blamed for the}} 1997 - 1999 East Asia economic crises. Consequently, Indonesia, together with many countries across the globe have been actively reviewing and improving their corporate governance and transparency mechanisms. Theoretically, corporate governance mechanism is designed to monitor and evaluate decisions made by managers {{in the management of}} a company to reduce agency cost and information asymmetry between the shareholders and the management. The main objective of the study is to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanism on the level of voluntary disclosure in Indonesia, a country that has adopted a <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system. The <b>two-tier</b> <b>board</b> system is considered a better system compared to one tier board system since all members of the board are non-executives. Therefore, the board members are more independent and objective in supervising and monitoring the performance of executive managers. This study investigates four corporate governance variables which are expected to influence the level of voluntary disclosure; (1) composition of independent members of Board of Commissioners (BOC), (2) composition of family members on the BOC, (3) audit quality, and (4) managerial ownership. The sample consists of companies listed on Bursa Saham Indonesia for the year ended 2008. The influence of corporate governance on the level of voluntary disclosure is analyzed using multiple regression method.
