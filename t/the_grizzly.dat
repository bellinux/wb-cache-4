5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. <b>The</b> <b>grizzly</b> is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting <b>the</b> <b>grizzly</b> are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as <b>the</b> <b>grizzly,</b> cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and <b>the</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> {{rivalry with}} <b>the</b> Spurs goes {{way back in}} 2004, when the Spurs swept <b>the</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> in <b>the</b> first round.

They would then meet again in the Conference Finals in 2013, and the Spurs once again swept <b>the</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> {{to go to the}} NBA Finals. In 2016, the Spurs then swept <b>the</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> again due to a lot of {{injuries}} <b>the</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> had during <b>the</b> season, and they met again the following year, where <b>the</b> <b>Grizzlies</b> lost in six games.|$|R

5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest is home to <b>the</b> <b>Grizzly</b> bear, cougar, moose, {{tens of thousands of}} elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure <b>the</b> <b>Grizzly</b> Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), a {{subspecies}} of {{the brown}} bear (Ursus arctos), {{is known for its}} aggressiveness; females are especially protective of their young. The state of Alaska is home to more than 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>grizzly</b> population in the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>grizzly</b> bear {{has several}} {{relationships}} with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After <b>the</b> <b>grizzly</b> consumes the fruit, the seeds are excreted and thereby dispersed in a germinable condition. Some {{studies have shown}} germination success is indeed increased {{as a result of}} seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces. This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats.|$|E
