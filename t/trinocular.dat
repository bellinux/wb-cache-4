40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} method of <b>trinocular</b> rectification {{to enhance the}} performance of stereo vision. In order to perform the <b>trinocular</b> rectification, we first obtain <b>trinocular</b> images by three cameras lying on a plane that faces the target objects. Then, we extract the original camera parameters, and compute the new camera parameters that transform the epipole on each image to the point at infinity. After that, we determine the homographies which relate the original camera parameters to the new ones, and decide an affine matrix which ensure 45 degrees for the epipolar line between top and left image. Finally, the <b>trinocular</b> rectification is finished by applying homographies and an affine transform to the obtained <b>trinocular</b> images. In contrast to conventional <b>trinocular</b> rectification methods that are mathematically and geometrically complicated, the proposed method is simple but efficient and accurate. ...|$|E

40|$|Absfruct- The {{principle}} of <b>trinocular</b> stereo {{is well known}} in the domain of passive devices and has application in active metrology as well. <b>Trinocular</b> active devices have the advantage of freedom from mechanical scanning and rapid image capture compared with more conventional active designs based on scanning laser stripes. Their eflicient operation relies, however, on a good solution to the correspondence problem. This requires careful geometric design to take account of epipolar geometry and thorough modeling of image-measurement error. We present a novel design that, curiously, involves setting up the projector-camera geometry to be degenerate-so that depth computation is ill-conditioned-and then backing off a little. We call this near-degenerate epipolar alignment. The result is that unambiguous stereo matching can, in principle, be guaranteed within a given working volume. This is in marked contrast with passive stereo in which ambiguity cannot be guaranteed, merely minimized statistically. The principles have proved to work well in laboratory tests, achieving unambiguous operation over a working volume of a 50 -mm cube with a depth resolution of around 0. 2 mm.

40|$|Abstract:- This study {{develops}} a novel least-squares algorithm for recovering the translational motion parameters of a moving object using a parallel <b>trinocular</b> vision system. Although the proposed approach overcomes the matrix singularity problem inherent in binocular observers, its implementation is somewhat complex. Accordingly, a compact closed-form {{version of the}} algorithm is proposed to facilitate real-world visual imaging applications. The closed-form scheme not only resolves the matrix singularity problem, but also avoids the requirement for matrix manipulation and is therefore computationally efficient. The validity of the closed-form scheme is verified by comparing the known translation displacements of a target object with the estimated values. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme accurately recovers the translational motion parameters provided that {{the movement of the}} target in the depth direction is of limited magnitude only. To verify the practical applicability of the proposed scheme, a servo tracking experiment is performed in which a parallel <b>trinocular</b> system mounted on a servo-driven positioning platform is used to track the motion of a target object as it is moved through a series of 3 D displacements. The experimental results demonstrate that the closed-form scheme enables the parallel <b>trinocular</b> vision system to track the target effectively...|$|E

40|$|For {{architectural}} metric documentation, S pherical P hotogrammetry (SP) {{has demonstrated}} its validity and efficiency in many projects already. The speed of surveying is high, the accuracy and completeness of the plotting are satisfactory. However, {{there are still}} many problems to be solved. The weakest point is the orientation procedure, which is rather difficult to perform, in the sense that only very experienced people can run it, and few people only make use of it. The old orientation steps are 1) model formation (limited to binocular panoramas couples); 2) link of all the models in a block adjustment with independent model triangulation; 3) block bundle adjustment with 4 parameters/pano (3 coord. + 1 orientation bearing); 4) block bundle adjustment with 6 parameters/pano, say the previous 4 + 2 correction angles around the horizontal axes. The panoramas must be spherical and quasi-horizontal. In order to make easier the orientation, enabling more people to use SP, an improved approach has been set up. It consists in the combination of any possible model formed either by three and two panoramas. The <b>trinocular</b> vision, say the combination of three different panoramas to form a unique model, has the advantage to be much more robust in comparison to binocular vision {{in the sense that the}} <b>trinocular</b> model is likely to be more error-free than any of the three composing binocular models. It contains less model deformation, the model coordinates are validated by the mutual comparison of the three intersecting binocular models. In addition, the number of possible <b>trinocular</b> models is normally much larger than the one of binocular models. The steps for a semi-automatic orientation of a block of panoramas proceed as follows: - Form any possible <b>trinocular</b> models by combination of the panoramas; - in case that no <b>trinocular</b> model has been formed, form any possible binocular model; - run a block adjustment with the algorithm of independent model, to link together the models in a unique reference system; - run a block bundle adjustment with collinearity equations with 4 unknown parameters per panorama; - run a block bundle adjustment with collinearity equations with 6 unknown parameters per panorama. The control requirements are limited to one fixed control point and two perpendicular constraints. Given a project with n panoramas, the <b>trinocular</b> possible models are the combination of n, 3 by 3, say (n*(n- 1) *(n- 2)) / 3 !. As an example, in a project with 10 panoramas the <b>trinocular</b> possible models are 120, while the possible binocular models are (n*(n- 1)) / 2 = 45. Obviously not all the panoramas will be formed, because a minimum of four common tie points is required. It is possible to select and filter out the best models by fixing a critical value on sigma naught for testing. The advantages are as follows: - no need of approximate value for the unknown coordinates and parameters; - easiness to find gross errors in the gradual block formation. The epipolar geometry has been investigated, the expression of the curve described and assessed: it can be useful in the <b>trinocular</b> model formation. For any try of the model the operator, thus causing troubles to him, must approximately choose formation, up to now the starting value of the orientation bearing for any panorama. However, a new procedure, not requiring any approximate value of the orientation bearing, has been set-up and tested: the orientation bearing can vary stepwise by a given selected interval, until the model is successfully formed. The computation time increases significantly, but it is still negligible. Up to now the control and tie points selection and observation is manual, making the orientation and the plotting to be slow and time consuming. Nevertheless, on the other end, the procedure is fully controlled and supervised by the operator, enabling the observation of the residuals and allowing the improvement of the orientation, and to perform some statistical quality analysis on the adjustment, which are not possible with automatic procedures based on S tructure f rom M otion (SfM). Another weak point of the SP is the speed of plotting. Commercial programs are now available, based on SFM algorithm, producing point clouds of good quality in an unknown scale and orientation. The correct scale and orientation can be therefore supplied by SP orientation with high accuracy. Examples are shown taken from two real projects...|$|E
