5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched <b>The</b> <b>Martian</b> with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (Septemberâ€“November).

5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, {{which had the}} benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, <b>The</b> <b>Martian</b> was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. <b>The</b> <b>Martian</b> played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, <b>The</b> <b>Martian</b> did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E

Before it can kill him, the Tripod suddenly keels forward and crashes into the ground.

50|$|The humans reach Mars, but {{in spite}} of their {{superior}} forces they have lost half their men to the Martians' overwhelming numbers. <b>The</b> <b>Martians</b> envelop <b>the</b> planet in a smoke screen, and the humans retreat to the moon Deimos. During a raid on Mars for supplies, the earth men find Aina, the last of a population of human slaves whose ancestors were captured from Kashmir in a Martian raid 9,000 years before. During this raid, <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> also constructed <b>the</b> Great Pyramids and the Great Sphynx in Egypt, the latter of which is a statue of their leader. Aina advises Edison that meeting <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> in battle would be fruitless, and that they should instead attack the dams that channel water from the polar ice. Since most of Mars' cities are under sea level, the flood spreads rapidly, killing most of <b>the</b> <b>Martians</b> and destroying their civilization. Edison and company force a peace with <b>the</b> surviving <b>Martians,</b> and return home to great celebration.|$|R

This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
