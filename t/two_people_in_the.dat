5|$|Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over {{portions}} of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received a record 12inches (305mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, affecting many northern villages and communes. Le Prêcheur was devastated by an extensive debris flow, which washed away entire structures. The disaster wrought $19million (1993USD) in damage across Martinique, and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy showed {{the need for}} a clear way for determining presidential disability {{in the context of the}} Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once suffered a heart attack and – with the office of Vice President to remain vacant until the next term began on January 20, 1965 – the next <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession were the 71-year-old Speaker of the House John McCormack and the 86-year-old Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden. Senator Birch Bayh succeeded Kefauver as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments and set about advocating for a detailed amendment dealing with presidential disability.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} in Tokushima caused landslides and blocked roads, resulting in disruptions to bus and train service. Strong winds overturned a truck, injuring the two occupants. In Muroto, several {{people were injured}} by flying glass. Rough waves killed <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same city, one in Fukuoka, damaged the seawall in Kyoto, and damaged 25ships. In Takamatsu, Kagawa, Etau left about ¥1.2billion (JPY, $10million USD) in crop damage, mainly due to damaged greenhouses. Two workers were killed in Higashiuwa after being swept away by a river. On Hokkaido, {{heavy rainfall}} caused landslides, damaging hundreds of roads and bridges and isolating several villages. River flooding swept away a vehicle in Kamishihoro, killing the five occupants. Along Mount Poroshiri, 29people were rescued by helicopter from a mountain lodge after Etau blocked off their descending trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials for}} the Columbia County {{residents}} held at Fort Mifflin {{were held in}} October and November 1864. At least three of those tried admitted to having been at a secret meeting on August 14, that many people were armed at the meeting, and that {{the people at the}} meeting intended to resist the soldiers in Bloomsburg. However, most of the prisoners were released on or before January 1865, although a few were held until May 1865. No one was charged for the murder of Lieutenant Robinson until 1891, when Elias Young was arrested and charged. Although Young admitted to firing a gun, he stated that <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party searching for deserters had fired first. The court ruled that Young was acting in self-defense, and he was declared not guilty.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected {{about two-thirds of}} Mexico. The rains from Ingrid caused flooding and landslides across Mexico, causing many rivers to rise, and isolating towns. In Veracruz alone, the rains flooded 68rivers, which damaged 121roads and 31bridges, including two destroyed bridges. About 14,000houses were damaged to some degree. Heavy rainfall forced 23,000people to evacuate their homes, 9,000of whom went to emergency shelters, some forced to leave by the Mexican army in high risk areas. Evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to the houses of friends and family. Also in Veracruz, flooding killed about 20,000livestock. Along the coast of Tamaulipas, damage occurred from Soto la Marina to La Pesca. The Pánuco River in Tamaulipas rose above its banks, flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads. Also in the state, the storm damaged local sorghum fields. <b>Two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state required rescue after their truck was swept away by a river.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. <b>Two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County {{and one in the}} city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, the {{rainfall}} in {{one week}} represented the average monthly values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District {{from the rest of}} the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000homes were flooded; 311people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, the floods killed <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country and caused BZ$54.1million (BZD, $27.1million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2million (BZD, $14.1million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7million (BZD, $6.3million USD) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7million (BZD, $1.5million USD) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.|$|E

5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of <b>two</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
