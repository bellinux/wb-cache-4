5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death.

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought {{the conflict in the}} Caribbean to an end. With the threat of attacks on British <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E

During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, but the number of visitors and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E

In 1932, the system of Imperial Preference was set up at the Ottawa Conference.

The Ayyubids also aspired to back their claims of legitimacy within the Caliphate by having sovereignty over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The conquests and economic advancements undertaken by Saladin effectively established Egypt's hegemony in the region.|$|E
