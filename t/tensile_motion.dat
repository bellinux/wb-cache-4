40|$|As a {{diagnostic}} {{application of the}} acoustic emission (AE) waveform analysis, crack inspection based on the moment tensor analysis is proposed. Because moment tensor components contain information on crack kinematics, the decomposition of eigenvalues of the moment tensor is possible and the contributions of shear motion and <b>tensile</b> <b>motion</b> to crack nucleation can be determined from the ratio of eigenvalues. Thus, cracks are classified into the type of dominant motion. After the crack types are determined, crack orientations can be decided from the directions of eigenvectors. The procedure developed was applied to a pull-out test of anchor bolt and a cylindrical tension test.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} theorectically the elastic and yield behaviors of strongly flocculated colloids by first examining the yield forces between two particles {{within the framework}} of Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeck (DLVO) interac-tions. Under highly attractive conditions, i. e., {{in the absence of the}} secondary minimum in the DLVO potential, the ra-dial (<b>tensile)</b> <b>motion</b> between particles is nonelastic because of the lack of an inflection point in the DLVO potential. However, the lateral (shear) motion is shown to be elastic up to a distance ymax, providing a mechanism for the ob-served elasticity in colloidal gels. If r 0 and s 0 are, respec-tively, the closest center-to-center and surface-to-surface distances between two particles, ymax ~ (1 2 0. 5 az 2) (s 0 r 0) 1 / 2 where z is the zeta potential of the particles and a a defined constant. Moreover, the yield force between two particles is much smaller in the lateral direction than in the radial direction. These results suggest that yielding of a particu-late network is likely to occur through the lateral move-ments between particles. The yield strain can be approxi-mated as that at which all the bonds in a certain direction have a perpendicular displacement>ymax, resulting in eyield 5 ymax r 0 ~ (1 2 0. 5 az 2) Ss 0 r...|$|E
40|$|Bone is {{continually}} being removed and replaced through {{the actions of}} basic multicellular units (BMU). This constant upkeep is necessary to remove microdamage formed naturally due to fatigue and thus maintain {{the integrity of the}} bone. The repair process in bone is targeted, meaning that a BMU travels directly to the site of damage and repairs it. It is still unclear how targeted remodelling is stimulated and directed but it is highly likely that osteocytes play a role. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the microcrack osteocyte interaction but no complete mechanism has been demonstrated. Osteocytes are connected to each other by dendritic processes. The “scissors model" proposed that the rupture of these processes where they cross microcracks signals the degree of damage and the urgency of the necessary repair. In its original form it was proposed that under applied compressive loading, microcrack faces will be pressed together and undergo relative shear movement. If this movement is greater than the width of an osteocyte process, then the process will be cut in a “scissors like" motion, releasing RANKL, a cytokine known to be essential in the formation of osteoclasts from pre-osteoclasts. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate this theoretical model with a specific focus on microscopy and finite element modelling. Previous studies had proved that cyclic stress was necessary for osteocyte process rupture to occur. This was a divergence from the original “scissors model" which had proposed that the cutting of cell material occurred in one single action. The present thesis is the first study to show fatigue failure in cellular processes spanning naturally occurring cracks and it's the first study to estimate the cyclic strain range and relate it to the number of cycles to failure, for any type of cell. Rupture due to shear movement was ruled out as microcrack closing never occurred, as a result of plastic deformation of the bone. Fatigue failure was found to occur due to cyclic tensile stress in the locality of the damage. The strain range necessary for osteocyte process rupture was quantified. It was found that the lower the process strain range the greater the number of cycles to cell process failure. FEM modelling allowed to predict stress in the vicinity of an osteocyte process and to analyse its interaction with the bone surrounding it: simulations revealed evident creep effects in bone during cyclic loading. This thesis confirms and dismisses aspects of the “scissors model". The observations support the model as a viable mechanism of microcrack detection by the osteocyte network, albeit in a slightly modified form where cyclic loading is necessary and the method of rupture is fatigue failure due to cyclic <b>tensile</b> <b>motion.</b> An in depth study was performed focusing on microscopy analysis of naturally occurring cracks in bone and FEM simulation analysis of an osteocyte process spanning a microcrack in bone under cyclic load. ...|$|E

POSS molecules were functionalised with two dichlorotriazine reactive dyes (CI Reactive Blue 4, CI Reactive Red 2) prior to compounding. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed functionalisation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed {{an increase in}} filler aggregation with concentration, with preferential phase selectivity. Ultraviolet spectroscopy and colourimetry confirmed colour uniformity and suggested that colour intensity could be controlled. Functionalised POSS improved thermal stability by imparting restrictions on SBS chain <b>motions.</b> <b>Tensile</b> stress-strain analysis revealed an increase in modulus with filler concentration, while creep deformation decreased and permanent strain increased with POSS content.

40|$|Modeling of tectonomagnetic {{changes is}} {{formulated}} in a unified way. First the linear relationship between magnetization and stress is obtained {{for a general}} 3 -dimensional stress state. It is deduced by applying the principle of superposition to experimental results of uniaxial compression tests. The isotropic piezomagnetic law thus obtained has two independent parameters, which {{is equivalent to the}} law proposed by ZLOTNICKI et al. (1981). The ordinary piezomagnetic law (STACEY, 1964; NAGATA, 1970 a) with a single parameter, i. e. the stress sensitivity, is a particular case of this extended formula. Because of its simplicity and validity as an average for aggregates of various rocks, the single parameter formula is applied in the following calculations. The basic equation is derived by connecting the Gaussian law for the magnetic field and the Cauchy-Navier equation for static elastic equilibrium through constitutive relationships, i. e. the piezomagnetic law and the Hooke law for isotropic elasticity. It is a Poisson's equation with a source term expressed in terms of the displacement. The representation theorem is obtained for the solution : the tectonomagnetic field is given by surface integrals of the displacement and its normal derivatives over the strained body. Applying the theorem to a medium including a dislocation surface within it, we find that the dislocation surface behaves as a magnetic sheet. For Volterra dislocations, the magnetic sheet becomes simply a double layer, of which the moment is given by the inner product of the displacement discontinuity and the magnetization vector. The seismomagnetic moment thus defined is useful to intuitively realize coseismic magnetic changes. In the following calculations, the model earth considered is the simplest one: a homogeneous and isotropic elastic half-space having a uniformly magnetized top layer with a constant stress sensitivity. The piezomagnetic field associated with the Mogi model is investigated in detail. Two mathematical techniques are introduced, which are frequently used throughout this study: i. e. the double Fourier (or Hankel) transforms and the Lipschitz-Hankel type integrals. The piezomagnetic field associated with the inflation of a finite spherical pressure source is solved with the aid of these two methods. The point source solution is also obtained, and subsequently used as a Green's function for the multiple Mogi model in Chapter 5. The way we obtained the point source solution becomes the prototype of constructing Green's functions in the following chapters. In the case of integrals containing a singular point of the stress field, we must take a limit in a special way: i. e. to enclose the singular point with a closed surface which satisfies the boundary conditions and then to shrink the surface to that point. A variety of tectonic models can be formed by superposing the displacement field solutions of single forces acting at points in an elastic half-space. Piezomagnetic changes associated with the same models are given as well by the linear combination of fundamental piezomagnetic potentials, which arise from stress-induced magnetization produced by unit single forces acting at points. The method is adaptable to surface load and volume source problems. As an application example, piezomagnetic change is calculated for a uniform circular load. Comparing the calculations with some observations of the dammagnetic effect, we suggest that the in situ value of the stress sensitivity of the upper crust is an order of magnitude greater than that of stiff rocks which are usually tested in rock-magnetic experiments. Finally the dislocation problems are considered. The same integral representation as the Volterra formula for the elastic field is derived for the piezomagnetic field. The elementary piezomagnetic potentials are defined as the potentials produced by a point dislocation. The effect of divergent stresses around a point dislocation is evaluated as follows: we enclose the point dislocation with a small thin disk parallel to the infinitesimal dislocation surface, diminish the thickness of the disk and then its radius. Elementary potentials consits of dipoles and multipoles at the position of point dislocation and their mirror images with respect to the Curie depth. However, some types of strain nuclei lack magnetic source equivalents at the dislocation position. Hence the seismomagnetic effect accompanying some kinds of fault motion becomes much weaker than that anticipated from the seismomagnetic moment. An important application of the theory is the multiple tension-crack model, which is a versatile model for crustal dilatancy or crustal deformation of volcanic origin. Another application is the piezomagnetic change associated with faulting. Formulas for a vertical rectangular fault with shearing as well as <b>tensile</b> fault <b>motion</b> are presented. 地震や火山活動,あるいはゆるやかな地殻変動による地殻応力に伴って,地磁気が変化する. これは岩石が応力によって磁化を変えるピエゾ磁気効果を,その原因としている. 本論文では様々な地殻活動に伴うピエゾ磁気変化を統一的に扱う方法を定式化する. この理論は基本的には, STACEY (1964) が｢地震地磁気効果｣を見積る計算で行ったやり方を一般化したものである...|$|R
