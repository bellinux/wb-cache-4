5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} south of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City {{and for a}} brief period <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite}} side from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> After a fair distance through <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|As it {{continues}} through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side of <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> moved from the old two-lane road in the center of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> of <b>the</b> Teton Range lie {{almost entirely}} within Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Ranging from 9 mi {{to less than}} 1 mi in length and up to 6000 ft deep, <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> were carved {{primarily}} by glaciers over the past 250,000 years. <b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> in <b>the</b> Teton Range descend in altitude generally west to east and many have lakes at their outlets. The lakes were created by terminal moraines {{left behind by the}} now retreated glaciers. A few of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> have small glaciers that were created mostly during the Little Ice Age (1550-1850). Fast retreating Schoolroom Glacier is a tiny glacier located at the head of <b>the</b> South Cascade <b>Canyon.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> have streams from which rain and snowmelt flow towards Jackson Hole valley, and due to the sometimes rapid altitude descent, waterfalls are common. <b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> offer <b>the</b> easiest hiking access into the Teton Range.|$|R
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of pi√±on and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. <b>The</b> <b>canyon</b> is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> likely {{originated}} {{millions of}} years ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills. Uplift diverted that stream to its present course, leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap. California State Route 133 runs the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine, while California State Route 73 crosses it, running southeast-northwest. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo.|$|E
5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> since 1887 and a dirt road was built through <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E

40|$|Ecologists {{suspect that}} owls select {{specific}} areas based on prey availability. My {{objective was to}} determine and compare distributions and abundances of Mexican spotted owl prey species' within different vegetation types in <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and mesas of the Manti-LaSal National Forest in Utah. I conducted live-trapping during summer and fall, 1994 - 95. Woodrat species (Neotoma spp.) are the Mexican spotted owls primary prey species as determined by percent biomass. Peromyscus spp. are also {{important in terms of}} frequency. Woodrats were only captured in <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and were primarily captured within the pinyon (Pinus spp.) - juniper (Juniperus spp.) vegetation type. The Mexican spotted owls in southeastern Utah spend > 75 % of their time within <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and forage within pinyon-juniper stands in <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> Maintaining <b>the</b> present state of pinyon-juniper stands within <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> may benefit Mexican spotted owl populations in the Manti-LaSal National Forest...|$|R
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, {{winds through}} Laguna Canyon {{for the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
5|$|State Route 16 {{begins in}} Colusa County near Wilbur Springs at the {{junction}} with State Route 20. SR 16 goes south alongside Bear Creek, which enters a narrow canyon and joins with Cache Creek near the Yolo County line. SR 16 continues in <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> running close to the river, passing Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park, and emerging from <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> north of Rumsey. This section is so prone to rock slides that there are permanent gates at each end.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna Canyon area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} native Southern California wildlife, including large mammals such as mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and orange-throated whiptail. Except for the Laguna Lakes, <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E
50|$|Academy of <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> (AOC) is {{a public}} middle college high school in Santa Clarita, California, United States. The school, which enrolls {{students}} from the 9th to the 12th grade, {{is part of the}} William S. Hart High School District. It is located on the College of <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> campus where <b>the</b> students of AOC are concurrently enrolled. Those who are enrolled take high school classes on the College of <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> campus and take college courses at COC. During grades 9-12 students can earn up to 80 college units, enough to receive an associate degree. A few students at Academy of <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> have also received multiple associate degrees by or before their high school graduation. A bonus is that high school students will also receive a College of <b>the</b> <b>Canyons</b> I.D. card and a 25 Score Card. Unfortunately, due to CIF regulations, students are not allowed to participate in High School Sports or Intercollegiate Sports.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{sediment}} transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setubal and Cascais submarine canyons, Portuguese continental margin, were investigated {{on the basis}} of water column profiles of suspended particulate matter, records of near-bottom currents and settling fluxes of particulate matter obtained with benthic landers, and analysis of surface sediments. The results show that fine-grained predominantly lithogenic sediment derived from adjacent shelf areas accumulates in the upper reaches of <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> Sediment deposited further down in the middle and lower reaches of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> is essentially similar to the hemipelagic sediment found on the adjacent continental slope, indicating that down-canyon transport of sediment from the upper to <b>the</b> lower <b>canyon</b> is limited. Tidal currents measured at various depths in <b>the</b> Lisbon-Setubal <b>Canyon</b> appear sufficiently strong to resuspend and transport sediment, but net up-canyon flow of the bottom water may retain shelf-derived lithogenic sediment in <b>the</b> upper <b>canyon.</b> Sediment gravity flows, which in <b>the</b> nearby Nazare <b>Canyon</b> are an effective mechanism for down-canyon {{sediment transport}}, appear rare in <b>the</b> Lisbon-Setubal <b>Canyon</b> and probably also in <b>the</b> Cascais <b>Canyon.</b> Turbidity current events recorded in the sedimentary record of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> may correspond to seismic events of 1969 and 1755 AD...|$|R
50|$|The {{topography}} of University City includes mesas and canyons such as Rose Canyon, San Clemente Canyon, and finger canyons that provide {{much of the}} open space. <b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> provide wildlife habitats with about 100 bird species migrating through the area plus natural views and opportunities for hiking, biking, and birding. <b>The</b> <b>canyons</b> are fire-managed and thus present small wildfire risks.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>canyon</b> {{was finally}} {{bypassed}} completely with {{the completion of}} the Surf Line on August 12, 1888, and the line through <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> was relegated to branch line status. By 1900 it had been abandoned by AT Finally, the 1928 construction of Railroad Canyon Dam submerged the section of track between Elsinore and Perris beneath Railroad Canyon Lake (now known as Canyon Lake).|$|E
5|$|The extreme {{steepness}} {{and depth}} of the Black Canyon formed {{as the result of}} several geologic processes acting together.

5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Paintings of <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were {{exhibited}} at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904, followed by a glowing article in Scribner's Magazine the next year.
