5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E

After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own.

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E

They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Anu. Rani tells Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Varun's car, which is seen by Constable Sahadevan (Kalabhavan Shajon), who has a grudge against Georgekutty.

5|$|Hutchinson chose Gromek as {{his opening}} day starter for the 1954 season against the former St. Louis Browns {{in their first}} game as the Baltimore Orioles, using the starter with the most {{experience}} {{in order to get}} the Tigers to start the season strong; he shut <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> seven hits in a 3–0 win. After his first four games, he developed a reputation for his quick pitching, with baseball games ending half an hour earlier on average on days he pitched. On May 9, his complete game eleven inning victory over the Chicago White Sox improved Gromek's record to 5–0 with a 1.72 ERA, making him the first pitcher in the league with five wins. He also became the first to seven wins in mid-May, but then went on five-game losing streak, not winning game eight until June 15 against the Red Sox. For the season, Gromek had 18 wins, 16 losses, a 2.74 ERA, and 102 strikeouts in 252.2 innings pitched and 36 games, 32 of them starts. He led the Tigers in wins, losses, ERA, and innings pitched, and his ERA and innings pitched were both ranked fifth in the AL.|$|E

25|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether Jesse and Frank {{took part in}} the Clay County robbery. After the James {{brothers}} successfully conducted other robberies and became legendary, some observers retroactively credited them with being the leaders of the robbery. Others have argued that Jesse was at the time still bedridden with his wound, and therefore could not have participated. No evidence has been found that connects either brother to the crime, nor conclusively rules <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> June 13, 1866, in Jackson County, Missouri, the gang freed two jailed members of Quantrill's gang, killing the jailer in the effort.

25|$|Thales, so {{the story}} goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his {{knowledge}} of astronomy he had observed {{while it was still}} winter {{that there was going to}} be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.|$|E

Meanwhile, Carrington dispatched another group of 42 soldiers to join Ten Eyck. The Indians in the valley slowly dispersed and disappeared. Ten Eyck advanced carefully and the soldiers found the bodies of Fetterman and all of his men in the valley. The dead soldiers were stripped naked and mutilated in ritual fashion. That afternoon, wagons were sent to bring the bodies back to Fort Kearny.|$|E

25|$|Utilizing the wildcat formation, Shaq Washington {{rushed for}} a {{touchdown}} within the first minute of the final quarter of play, pulling the Bearcats within 19. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY recovered a fumble from T. J. Logan, fueling momentum for the Bearcats, who started at the 6-yard line. They started in the wildcat, but when faced with third and goal at the eight-yard line, Kay returned at quarterback and completed a pass, but it was short of the end zone; the Bearcats went for it on fourth down, and Kay threw a pass that bounced off {{the hands of his}} intended target, and thus, they turned the ball over. Looking to milk the clock on their ensuing drive, UNC achieved a first down prior to losing six yards on a rush to set up third down and long; a pass interference bailed <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the third and long play, as though the pass was incomplete, the 15-yard penalty gave them an automatic first down. They succeeded in their endeavor to drain time from the clock, ultimately executing a 14-play drive that gained 74 yards and lasted 9:19, and culminated with a 40-yard field goal to complete the scoring.|$|E
25|$|In January 1806 Franchise {{was under}} the command of Captain Charles Dashwood. He {{received}} information that several Spanish vessels had anchored in the Bay of Campeche and he determined to try to cut <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> the night of 6 January Franchise arrived some five leagues off the town of Campeche and Dashwood had her anchor in four fathoms as the water was too shallow to come any closer. He then sent in three of Franchises boats {{under the command of}} Lieutenants John Fleming and Peter Douglas, his first and third lieutenants, and Lieutenant Mends of the Marines. Because of the distance they had to row, the British were unable to approach closely until 4am, by which time the moon had risen, they had been spotted, and the Spaniards alerted. The Spanish vessels consisted of two naval brigs, one of 20 guns and 180 men, and another of 12 guns and 90 men, a schooner armed with eight guns, and seven gunboats, each armed with two guns. They opened fire on the approaching row boats and might have destroyed the attack had Lieutenant Fleming not led his three boats to the smaller of the brigs and boarded her. After about ten minutes of hand-to-hand fighting, the British had captured her and were sailing her out, pursued by the other Spanish vessels, which continued to fire on them. The British returned fire from their prize and their boats and the Spanish vessels withdrew.|$|E
25|$|Schaper's death squad was {{deployed}} in the newly formed Bezirk Bialystok district soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Himmler himself visited Białystok on 30 June 1941 and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, because the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army left behind a security vacuum. On 3 July additional formation of Schutzpolizei arrived in the city from the General Government, led by SS-Hauptsturmführer Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of Einsatzgruppe IV from the Polish Campaign. The relief unit, called kommando Bialystok, was sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office, due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> 10 July 1941 Schaper's Einsatzgruppe was subdivided into dozens of smaller commandos (Einsatzkommandos) numbering from several to several scores of people whose mission was to kill Jews, alleged communists and the Soviet NKVD collaborators in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. The entire Einsatzgruppe employed the same, systematic method of mass killing across many Polish villages and towns {{in the vicinity of}} Białystok. Schaper's murderous rampage south-east of East Prussia is fairly well documented, and included Wizna (end of June), Wąsosz (5 July), Radziłów (7 July), Jedwabne (10 July), Łomża (early August), Tykocin (22–25 August), Rutki (4 September), Piątnica, Zambrów as well as other locations.|$|E
