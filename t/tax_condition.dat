40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether a high tax on high calorie dense foods effectively reduces the purchased calories of high energy dense foods {{in a web}} based supermarket, and whether this effect is moderated by budget and weight status. 306 participants purchased groceries in a web based supermarket, with an individualized budget {{based on what they}} normally spend. Results showed that relative to the no <b>tax</b> <b>condition,</b> the participants in the <b>tax</b> <b>condition</b> bought less calories. The main reduction was found in high energy dense products and in calories from carbohydrates, but not in calories from fat. BMI and budget did not influence the effectiveness of the tax. The reduction in calories occurred regardless of budget or BMI implying that a food tax may be a beneficial tool, along with other measures, in promoting a diet with fewer calories...|$|E

In setting out the optimal <b>tax</b> <b>conditions</b> {{in the presence of}} externalities, it is standard to follow Sandmo (1975) to employ the following assumptions: (i) separable externalities; and (ii) independent demands.

In addition, the paper develops a method for assessing the impact of tax policy on the volatility of investment when such policy is endogenous. Illustrative calculations using this technique, based on the paper's empirical estimates, suggest that tax policy has not served to stabilize investment in equipment or nonresidential structures during the sample period. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with tax-planning strategies of multinational corporations. A theoretical analysis discusses {{the choice of the}} capital structure in a setting where intercompany loans can be used to shift profits to low-tax countries. Empirical evidence is provided using micro-level panel data of virtually all German multinationals made available by the Bundesbank. This comprehensive dataset allows us to exploit differences in <b>taxing</b> <b>conditions</b> of almost eighty countries during a period of nine years. The empirical results confirm a robust impact of tax-rate differences within the multinational group on the use of intercompany loans, supporting the profit-shifting hypothesis. However, the implied tax-revenue effects are rather small, suggesting that costs related to adjusting the capital structure for profit-shifting purposes are substantial. corporate taxation, multination corporations, tax planning, intercompany loans, tax haven, FDI, micro-level data...|$|R

50|$|In 1968, the Luxembourgish {{government}} {{had for the}} first time to defend a vital interest of the Grand Duchy which would be contested more than once by its partners. This was the financial centre. This had been developing since the early 1960s thanks to advantageous banking and tax laws. However, since their 1968 meetings, the finance ministers of the EEC were considering a plan to harmonise the taxation of movements of capital. This proposition encountered vehement opposition from Pierre Werner. Conscious of the danger that the levelling of <b>tax</b> <b>conditions</b> posed to the fledgling financial centre, the Minister of Finances proposed instead to give priority to monetary harmonisation. In the event, the difficulties of the pound sterling and the French franc would turn the attention of European finance ministers' away from the Luxembourgish financial centre, and put monetary questions on the back-burner.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the shifting of taxable profits by means of borrowing and lending between affliates of multinational corporations. Empirical evidence is provided using microlevel panel data of virtually all German multinationals made available by the German Central Bank (Bundesbank). This comprehensive dataset allows us to exploit differences in <b>taxing</b> <b>conditions</b> in more than 150 countries over a period of ten years. The empirical results confirm a robust impact of tax-rate differences within the multinational group on the use of internal debt, supporting the view that internal debt is used to shift profits to low-tax countries. However, the tax effects are rather small. Given that the empirical literature finds profit shifting to be substantial, our estimates suggest that other strategies to shift income to low-tax countries are relatively more important.

40|$|Results of a {{cross-cultural}} study of adult crying across 37 countries are presented. Analyses focused on country differences in recency of last crying episode and crying proneness and relationships with country characteristics. Three hypotheses {{on the nature}} of country differences in crying were evaluated: (a) distress due to exposure to <b>taxing</b> <b>conditions,</b> (b) norms regarding emotional expressiveness, and (c) personality (at country level). Individuals living in more affluent, democratic, extraverted, and individualistic countries tend to report to cry more often. These indicators relate to freedom of expression rather than to suffering; therefore, our data provide support for a model that views country differences in crying as being connected with country differences in expressiveness and personality rather than in distress. Gender differences in crying proneness were larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries. Differences in the meaning of crying at individual level (usually viewed as a sign of distress) and country level (as a sign of expressiveness and personality) are discussed...|$|R

40|$|For servicemembers {{who have}} {{sustained}} amputations and wish {{to return to}} Active Duty, performing common military tasks is essential. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the metabolic requirements of servicemembers with transtibial amputations wearing a loaded rucksack and walking at a steady speed. We tested 12 servicemembers with unilateral transtibial amputations and 12 uninjured controls on a treadmill at two walking speeds (1. 34 and 1. 52 m/s) while they carried a 32. 7 kg load. Oxygen consumption was recorded. Results showed that metabolic demand for the injured servicemembers was ­significantly higher (8. 5 % at 1. 34 m/s and 10. 4 % at 1. 52 m/s) than for controls. An understanding of energy expended during load carriage by this study population is critical for decisions regarding return-to-duty requirements. Although significant differences existed between uninjured controls and those with amputations, it is important to note that those differences are less than previously published. This finding, coupled with the fact that servicemembers with transtibial amputations have redeployed, implies that, despite statistical significance, results may not be clinically relevant. Future work should include more <b>taxing</b> <b>conditions</b> to identify a threshold for potential limitations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} how hearing-impaired listeners perceive native (Swedish) and nonnative (English) {{speech in}} the presence of noise- and speech maskers. Speech reception thresholds were measured for four different masker types for each target language. The maskers consisted of stationary and fluctuating noise and two-talker babble in Swedish and English. Twentythree hearing-impaired native Swedish listeners participated, aged between 28 and 65 years. The participants also performed cognitive tests of working memory capacity in Swedish and English, nonverbal reasoning, and an English proficiency test. Results indicated that the speech maskers were more interfering than the noise maskers in both target languages. The larger need for phonetic and semantic cues in a nonnative language makes a stationary masker relatively more challenging than a fluctuating-noise masker. Better hearing acuity (pure tone average) was associated with better perception of the target speech in Swedish, and better English proficiency was associated with better speech perception in English. Larger working memory and better pure tone averages were related to the better perception of speech masked with fluctuating noise in the nonnative language. This suggests that both are relevant in highly <b>taxing</b> <b>conditions.</b> A large variance in performance between the listeners was observed, especially for speech perception in the nonnative language...|$|R
