She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard him talk right in <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> <b>I</b> thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then...

500|$|In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a {{contract}} to make [...] "some extreme albums". He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label, and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album Millennium and the 1995 album Hard Wired by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name {{at this point in}} career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have," [...] he later explained. [...] "I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music." [...] Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, which was released in April 1995.|$|E
500|$|As Friedman noted, if {{the price}} of silver had {{remained}} high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." [...] One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, [...] "at <b>the</b> <b>beginning...</b> <b>I</b> was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began {{to understand what was}} required of her from her second episode onwards.

500|$|The ninth {{season of}} the show was {{produced}} by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Television. The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> <b>I</b> think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>I</b> called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E

Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>I</b> used to go down [...] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E

[...] The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen graded the episode with a B-. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly believed that [...] "in some ways, {{this was one of}} the less-distinctive, more X-Files-ish episodes of Fringe on Thursday night... But as usual, there was another narrative layer at work here" [...] involving a grieving Olivia. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to... But besides that great little scene at the end, I thought this was an average episode. Granted, Fringes 'average' episodes are still better than a lot of the other stuff on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was {{released}} in November 1990 and was described as [...] "leaps and bounds more mature" [...] than her previous albums. Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also {{seen as part of}} her departure from her earlier persona. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991. Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It {{was released}} in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, [...] "Word Is Out", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, subsequent singles [...] "If You Were with Me Now" [...] and [...] "Give Me Just a Little More Time" [...] both reached the top five. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, [...] "I was very much a puppet in <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> <b>I</b> was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right." [...] Her first Greatest Hits album {{was released in}} August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia.

500|$|Sonny Takhar, {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. [...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans." [...] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, [...] "which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans," [...] according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian. One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>I</b> didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E
