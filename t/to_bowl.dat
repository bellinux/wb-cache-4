5|$|Miller was unfit <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> {{during the}} Second Test at Lord's. During England's first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, {{hoping that he}} would reverse his {{decision}} not <b>to</b> <b>bowl.</b> Miller refused and returned the ball, citing his back. Miller's action generated news headlines, with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E
5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon <b>to</b> <b>bowl.</b> On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to dismiss Midwinter.|$|E
5|$|After the First Test, Ring {{returned}} to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took {{four of the}} last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> 81.1overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.|$|E

5|$|After this {{marathon}} effort, Davidson scored 81 as New South Wales {{defeated the}} tourists by an innings {{for the second}} time in the space of the month. He was only asked <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> five overs after his efforts in Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Australia then {{proceeded}} to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Loxton was not required <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> in the first innings as the hosts fell for 83 in 36.5 overs. In the second innings, Loxton was given the new ball and bowled 12 overs without success, conceding 28 runs before Essex were all out for 187.|$|E
5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, {{and he was still}} not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit <b>to</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rahman {{achieved}} {{success in}} the beginning of his international career by bowling off cutters, a type of bowling which swings the ball away. Rahman stated on a press conference in June 2015 that he first discovered the technique after his fellow cricketer, Anamul Haque insisted him <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> a slower delivery.|$|E
5|$|The Second Test {{match was}} held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first {{afternoon}} after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers; the fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared {{up in the first}} over; Lindwall played on through the pain. Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> and take inspiration from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated news headlines among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E
5|$|The war then {{interrupted}} Ring's first-class career. Ring {{joined the}} Australian Army {{and served with}} an anti-aircraft regiment in New Guinea. During his military service he injured his back, displacing a disc. The injury flared up from time to time, especially in cold weather, and this affected his ability <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> to a consistent length.|$|E

According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> at him.|$|E
5|$|A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was {{a member}} of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to a {{persistent}} knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. However, his knee failed in the first innings of the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career.|$|E
5|$|A {{match against}} Surrey started {{the day after}} the Second Test ended, but Bradman {{nevertheless}} asked Toshack <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> 20 overs as Surrey batted first. He took 2/76 including opposition captain Errol Holmes. In reply to the hosts' 221, Toshack made one in Australia's total of 389. He then removed Arthur McIntyre and Eric Bedser in the second innings and ended with 2/29 as Australia won by ten wickets. Toshack was then rested after playing 12 days of cricket in two weeks, missing the innings victory over Gloucestershire.|$|E

5|$|A {{whole week}} passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> {{them out for}} a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to give him his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E
5|$|After the new ball bowlers had {{finished}} their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's off spin for one over, {{before going on}} the attack in the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a six over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back a tired Miller <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> medium pace off breaks, to no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall {{had been the only}} bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> medium-paced off breaks.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> first. Somerset scored 269 runs off their full {{allocation}} of 60 overs, during which West Indian batsman Viv Richards top-scored for the county, totalling 117 runs. In their response, Northamptonshire lost early wickets, but a partnership of 113 between Geoff Cook and Allan Lamb {{kept them in}} the game. Six wickets from Joel Garner helped Somerset bowl their opponents out for 224 with 3.3 overs remaining, earning the county the first trophy in their 104-year history.|$|E

5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on <b>to</b> <b>bowl</b> and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS {{football}} season, both Georgia and Virginia Tech {{were named}} <b>to</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series bowl games, indicating an increase over their 2006 performances.

5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. On the other hand, England made three changes; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced {{the left arm}} orthodox of Young, all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5. batsman. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman, who gambled on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Miller played, but was unfit <b>to</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|E
