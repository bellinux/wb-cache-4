5|$|Biggs and Wedge, {{inspired}} by two Star Wars {{characters of the}} same name, appear in numerous titles as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later titles in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos and Moogles. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments {{as a means of}} long-distance <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> characters. Moogles, on the other hand, are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different capacities in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate titles.|$|E

All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E

The tuition and <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E

5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. <b>Travel</b> <b>for</b> Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E

5|$|During the 1470s {{conflict}} {{developed between}} {{the king and}} his brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar. Mar died suspiciously in 1480 and his estates were forfeited and possibly given to a royal favourite, Robert Cochrane. Albany fled to France in 1479, accused of treason. By this point the alliance with England was failing and from 1480 there was intermittent war, followed by a full-scale invasion of Scotland two years later, led by the Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III, and accompanied by Albany. James was imprisoned by his own subjects in Edinburgh Castle, and Albany was established as lieutenant-general. Having taken Berwick-upon-Tweed the English retreated and Albany's government began to collapse forcing him to flee. Despite conspiracies and more attempts at invasion, James was able to regain power. However, the king managed to alienate the barons, refusing to <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> the implementation of justice, preferring to be resident in Edinburgh, he debased the coinage, probably creating a financial crisis, he continued to pursue an English alliance and dismissed key supporters, including his Chancellor Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, becoming estranged from his wife, Margaret of Denmark, and his son James. Matters {{came to a head}} in 1488 when he faced an army raised by the disaffected nobles, and many former councillors, acting {{in the name of the}} prince as James IV. He was defeated at the Battle of Sauchieburn and killed.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone {{of alert}} from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.

The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4meters (13ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea {{as a result of the}} port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600families might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo analyze gender inequalities in {{socioeconomic}} {{factors affecting}} {{the amount of}} time spent <b>travelling</b> <b>for</b> work-related and home-related reasons among working individuals aged between 30 and 44 years old during a weekday in Catalonia (Spain). MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were obtained from employed individuals aged between 30 and 44 years of age who reported travelling on the day prior to the interview in the Catalan Mobility Survey 2006 (N = 23, 424). Multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted to determine the factors associated with longer time spent travelling according to the reason <b>for</b> <b>travelling</b> (work- or home-related journeys). Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals are presented. ResultsA higher proportion of men travelled and spent more time <b>travelling</b> <b>for</b> work-related reasons, while a higher proportion of women travelled and spend more time <b>travelling</b> <b>for</b> home-related reasons. A higher educational level was associated with greater time spent <b>travelling</b> <b>for</b> work-related reasons in both men and women but was related to an increase in <b>travelling</b> time <b>for</b> home-related reasons only in men. In women, a larger household was associated with greater <b>travel</b> time <b>for</b> home-related reasons and with less <b>travel</b> time <b>for</b> work-related reasons. ConclusionThis study confirms the different mobility patterns in men and women, related to their distinct positions in the occupational, family and domestic spheres. Gender inequalities in mobility within the working population are largely determined by the greater responsibility of women in the domestic and family sphere. This finding should be taken into account in the design of future transport policies...|$|R
