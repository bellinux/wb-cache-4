5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations {{were made at}} the beginning of the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American Sheep Breeder at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (<b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep Breeder, 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi or losing score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E

Additionally, Michael Ensign voiced Doctor Nefarious Tropy, William Hootkins voiced Dingodile and Mel Winkler voiced Aku Aku.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 May, as Little Belt was some 48 miles east of Cape Charles at the {{entrance}} to Chesapeake Bay, she sighted a strange sail in the distance. Bingham made signal #277, which requested the strange ship, if a British warship, to show her number. The other ship did not reply and Bingham concluded that the mystery ship was a United States Navy frigate. He hoisted his colours and began to round Cape Hatteras. The frigate followed, catching up to Little Belt, and appeared to be trying to maneuver into a position to rake the sloop. Bingham veered three times to foil the American's attempts, while calling for the frigate to identify herself. Each time though the American demanded <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> Bingham. The frigate, actually the 44-gun USS President under Commodore John Rodgers had mistaken Little Belt for another British warship which had recently been observed impressing American sailors. Bingham claimed President then opened fire on Little Belt, although the Americans claimed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> the British. Regardless, an engagement began, lasting three-quarters of an hour. The British observed that President had a fire onboard as she drew away.|$|E

ND lost NOK810 million in 1991, and with an eighty percent decrease was the European company to have the second-largest share price loss in 1991.

The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not Lie groups – but the philosophy is <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>Of</b> course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries.

25|$|The {{first two}} {{elements}} of period 8 {{are expected to}} be ununennium and unbinilium, elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s orbital being filled. This orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted and thus, elements 119 and 120 should be more like rubidium and strontium than their immediate neighbours above, francium and radium. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the atomic radii of these two elements should be about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>of</b> those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal alkali and alkaline earth metals, normally forming +1 and +2 oxidation states respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p3/2 subshell and the relatively low ionization energies of the 7p3/2 electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.|$|E

Samuel Johnson reported that in the 18th century sheep's milk was made [...] "into small cheeses" [...] by the St Kildans. They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy seas and unpredictable weather. The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially gannet and fulmar. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of fowling rods.
