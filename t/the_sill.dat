5|$|The only {{substantial}} part of the priory to survive was the eastern gable of the presbytery with its great east window. Its survival owed much {{to the rise of}} Romanticism in the 18th century. The portrayal of ruined buildings in idealised landscapes by J. M. W. Turner and his contemporaries inspired a fashion for the nobility and gentry to produce paintings of monasteries providing an incentive for landowners to preserve them as romantic ruins, rather than using them as quarries. Gisborough Priory's east window {{was one of the first}} examples of a monastic ruin to be retained for its visual qualities. It was incorporated into the grounds of Old Gisborough Hall as a romantic ruin and <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> of the great window removed to ensure an uninterrupted view. Fittingly, given his role in inspiring the east window's preservation, Turner himself sketched it in 1801 during a visit to Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting.

25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> plates with additional fittings.|$|E
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} non-hydrostatic {{model of a}} fjord is used to examine {{to what extent the}} internal tide is modified by two closely spaced <b>sills.</b> <b>The</b> model is forced with an M 2 barotropic tide and internal tides, unsteady lee waves and a jet are generated at <b>the</b> <b>sills.</b> In contrast to an isolated sill, calculations with two closely spaced <b>sills</b> show that <b>the</b> presence of <b>the</b> second <b>sill</b> leads to standing internal wave generation with associated changes in wave spectrum and Richardson number in <b>the</b> inter <b>sill</b> region. Associated with these there is a cascade of energy towards short waves leading to enhanced mixing between <b>the</b> <b>sills.</b> This increase in mixing is consistent with enhanced mixing between closely spaced sills found in observations. It is also relevant to enhanced oceanic and lake mixing, and suggest that future mixing measurements in both oceans and lakes should focus on these regions. ...|$|R

The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. <b>The</b> <b>sill</b> of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as <b>the</b> <b>sill</b> for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline.

40|$|The Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide {{deposits}} in the Yangliuping area, SW China, are hosted in mafic-ultramafic <b>sills.</b> <b>The</b> four mineralized <b>sills</b> {{are located in}} the Yangliuping tectonic dome and intrude Devonian carbonaceous marble, graphitic schist. <b>The</b> <b>sills</b> are 200 - 300 m thick and 1, 000 - 2, 000 m in strike length and now consist chiefly of serpentinite, talc schist, tremolite schist, and meta-gabbro. Disseminated Ni-Cu sulfide mineralisation occurs in the serpentinite in the lower parts of <b>the</b> <b>sills.</b> Massive sulfide mineralisation is located in the base of <b>the</b> <b>sills</b> and in <b>the</b> footwall along fractures beneath the mineralized serpentinite. Although the sulfide ores have been modified by hydrothermal activity, there are relict cumulate textures in the disseminated sulfides indicating a magmatic origin for the ores. The Yangliuping Intrusions and the Dashibao Formation have similar primitive-mantle normalized trace element and platinum group element (PGE) patterns, indicating that they are derived from a common parental magma type. The positive correlation between Cu concentrations and Cu/Zr ratios of the Dashibao Formation basalts indicates that the chalcophile elements were removed before eruption. We propose that fractional crystallization of the Yangliuping magma accompanied by the introduction of S and CO 2 from the wall rocks caused the magma to become S-saturated leading to the segregation of magmatic sulfides that became enriched in Ni-Cu-(PGE). <b>The</b> <b>sills</b> acted as conduits for the overlying Dashibao Formation basalts with the sulfide liquid, along with early crystallizing olivine and pyroxene, segregating from the magma as it passed through the conduits prior to eruption. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular spaceframe chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor rear visibility and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting on <b>the</b> <b>sill,</b> and reversing while looking over the back of the car from outside.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} over 27 sills and 213 {{associated}} vents. <b>The</b> <b>sills</b> and vents were investigated using 3 D seismic data, in a 1000 km 2 area, offshore Norway between the Møre and Vøring Basins (the Edvarda survey). A {{wide range of}} sill geometries are observed which are interpreted {{to be the result}} of five different processes acting on <b>the</b> <b>sills.</b> Three of these processes relate to how the host deforms. If sill intrusion causes deformation of the seafloor, creating folds, or <b>the</b> <b>sills</b> interact with folds created by neighbouring sills, sills are found to cross bedding (transgress) abruptly. Alternatively, if deformation is interpreted to be local, then continuously increasing Young’s Modulus with depth is interpreted to result in sills which transgress continuously upwards, akin to smooth ‘bowls’. At shallow depths the host is interpreted to fluidise, leading to limited transgression or in some cases multiple bowls. The seismic amplitude responses of shallow sills include flow related features such as channels and lobes. The other two processes interpreted to affect sill propagation stem from structures in the host: abrupt changes in lithology and pre-existing faults. Multiple sills are found to terminate, and in some cases form, at sand rich units in the otherwise mudstone dominated host. Additionally, some sills are interpreted to have intruded into a host with pre-existing polygonal faults, which led to angular sill geometries. Vents are found to occur directly above <b>sills,</b> often along <b>the</b> margins of <b>sills,</b> but in some cases over sill interiors, especially where <b>the</b> <b>sills</b> are locally shallower. Additionally, a cluster of 98, relatively small vents occur above <b>the</b> shallowest <b>sill.</b> Differential compaction and slumping are found to affect some larger vent morphologies. Overall, vent size is found to closely follow a power-law such that smaller vents are significantly more numerous than larger vents...|$|R
