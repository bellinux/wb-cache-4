She placed {{third in}} the {{all-around}} with a two-day combined score of 120.950, and finished first on beam (30.650) and floor (31.250). Károlyi said: [...] "She is just so solid.

2500|$|Stone took on {{the role}} of a {{clinically}} depressed woman in the independent drama When a Man Falls in the Forest (2007), premiered in competition at the 2007 Berlin Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. She found her part [...] "challenging" [...] to play, remarking: [...] "It was a watershed experience. I think {{that we live in a}} [...] Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're supposed to feel about something." [...] Her next film roles have been in independent productions, including the late 2000s films If I Had Known I Was a Genius (2007), The Year of Getting to Know Us (2008), Five Dollars a Day (2009) and Streets of Blood (2009), all of which went directly-to-DVD in North America.|$|E
50|$|Task-oriented {{leaders are}} {{typically}} {{less concerned with}} the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer.|$|R

2500|$|Late that year, an {{incident}} involving Xu Yushi's son Xu Ziran (許自然) {{would lead to}} Xu Yushi's removal. [...] Xu Ziran, {{who was in charge}} of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops. [...] When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer. [...] Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor. [...] When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym. [...] Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, [...] "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me. [...] Is this not an abuse of power?" [...] Xu responded, [...] "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone. [...] That is why I am being attacked. [...] As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so. [...] I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, and I only know how to perfect myself behind closed doors. [...] How can I abuse power?" [...] This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, [...] "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?" [...] Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, [...] "For an imperial subject <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!" [...] Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.|$|E

They had to climb over the railing to the platform in front of the wheel-house to get to the stairs, and as the steamer rolled a little, and the stairs shook, they went down very slowly, backward, and {{when they got to the}} bottom were afraid to step into the boat, which looked pretty unsteady as it wobbled about under them.|$|E

But you mustn't call me {{anything}} but sir, or Mr. Pendennis, if you like; for we live in very different stations, Fanny; and don't think I speak unkindly; and--and why do you take your hand away, Fanny? Are you afraid of me? Do you think I would hurt you? Not for all the world, my dear little girl. And--and look how beautiful the moon and stars are, and how calmly they shine when the rockets have gone out, and the noisy wheels have done hissing and blazing. When I came here to-night I did not think I should have had such a pretty little companion to sit by my side, and see these fine fireworks. You must know I live by myself, and work very hard. I write in books and newspapers, Fanny; and I quite tired out, and was expected to sit alone all night; and--don't cry, my dear, dear, little girl." [...] Here Pen broke out, rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver; for the sight of a woman's tears always put his nerves in a quiver, and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her, and to utter a hundred and twenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy, which need not be repeated here, because they would be absurd in print. So would a mother's talk to a child be absurd in print; so would a lover's to his bride. That sweet artless poetry bears no translation; and is too subtle for grammarians' clumsy definitions. You have but the same four letters to describe the salute which you perform on your grandmother's forehead, and that which you bestow on the sacred cheek of your mistress; but the same four letters, and not one of them a labial. Do we mean to hint that r. Arthur Pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question? Not so. In the first place, it was dark: the fireworks were over, and nobody could see him; secondly, he was not a man <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of secret, and tell it; thirdly and lastly, let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl, say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture? ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{states have}} had {{analogous}} institutions, sometimes also rendered in English as margrave. For example, on England's Celtic borders (Welsh Marches and Scottish Marches), Marcher Lords were vassals of the King of England, expected {{to help him}} defend and expand his realm. Such a lord's demesne was called a march (compare the English county palatine). The Marcher Lords were a conspicuous exception to the general structure of English feudalism as set up by William the Conqueror, who made a considerable effort <b>to</b> avoid <b>having</b> too-powerful vassals with a big contiguous territory and a strong local power base; the needs of fighting the Welsh and Scots made it necessary <b>to</b> <b>have</b> exactly <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of vassal in the Marches, who did develop their own territorial ambitions (for example those of Chester).|$|R

50|$|A drama program usually {{features}} {{a set of}} actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting. The program follows their lives and adventures. Except for soap opera-type serials, many shows especially before the 1980s, remained static without story arcs, and the main characters and premise changed little. If some change happened to the characters' lives during the episode, it was usually undone by the end. Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order. Since the 1980s, there are many series that feature progressive change to the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere {{were two of the}} first American prime time drama television series <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of dramatic structure.

You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know.
