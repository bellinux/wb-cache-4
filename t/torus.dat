5|$|Some astronomers had {{suggested}} that the impacts might have a noticeable effect on the Io <b>torus,</b> a <b>torus</b> of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly volcanic moon Io. High resolution spectroscopic studies found that variations in the ion density, rotational velocity, and temperatures {{at the time of}} impact and afterwards were within the normal limits.|$|E
5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the <b>torus</b> is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the <b>torus</b> is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io <b>torus</b> fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large <b>torus</b> around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the <b>torus</b> to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The <b>torus</b> in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a <b>torus</b> of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this <b>torus,</b> the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and {{the energy is transmitted}} out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Ubisoft and {{developer}} <b>Torus</b> Games {{produced a}} substantially different Planet of the Apes game for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. It is a side-scroller following {{the first two}} films; the player controls astronaut Ben on the Planet of the Apes. The Game Boy versions received average reviews.|$|E
5|$|Built under Babylonian rule (605–539BC), {{the oldest}} {{monument}} {{at the site}} is a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that includes an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of marble column bases with <b>Torus</b> moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional <b>torus</b> or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened <b>torus,</b> with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|Voyagers 1 and 2 {{arrived to}} Jupiter in 1979–1980 and {{traveled}} almost in its equatorial plane. Voyager 1, which passed within 5RJ from the planet's center, {{was first to}} encounter the Io plasma <b>torus.</b> Voyager 2 passed within 10RJ and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was Ulysses in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi, and featured Hamasaki in a large skyscraper while singing to the song in different areas. In order to promote the single, it appeared on several remix and greatest hits compilation albums, and live concert <b>torus</b> conducted by Hamasaki. It was also used as the theme song for Japanese television show SemiDouble (1999). To date, the recording remains one of her highest-selling singles according to Oricon Style.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{also used}} at the Joint European <b>Torus</b> nuclear-fusion {{research}} laboratory, {{and it will be}} used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A <b>torus</b> of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a <b>torus,</b> the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a <b>torus</b> or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
25|$|A <b>torus</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a solid <b>torus,</b> which is formed by rotating a disc, rather than a circle, around an axis. A solid <b>torus</b> is a <b>torus</b> plus the volume inside the <b>torus.</b> Real-world approximations include doughnuts, many lifebuoys, and O-rings.|$|E
25|$|The Clifford <b>torus</b> {{divides the}} 3-sphere into two {{congruent}} solid tori. (In a stereographic projection, the Clifford <b>torus</b> {{appears as a}} standard <b>torus</b> of revolution. The fact that it divides the 3-sphere equally means that {{the interior of the}} projected <b>torus</b> is equivalent to the exterior, which is not easily visualized).|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of topology, a <b>torus</b> is any topological space that is topologically {{equivalent}} to a <b>torus.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} nebular {{components}} (or anomalies) of the Crab Nebula is a helium-rich <b>torus</b> which is visible as an east-west band crossing the pulsar region. The <b>torus</b> composes about 25% of the visible ejecta. However, it is suggested by calculation that about 95% of the <b>torus</b> is helium. As yet, {{there has been no}} plausible explanation put forth for the structure of the <b>torus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since each copy of S1 is an {{embedded}} submanifold of R2, the Clifford <b>torus</b> is an embedded <b>torus</b> in R2 times& R2 = R4.|$|E
25|$|There is a 2-1 {{covering}} map {{from the}} <b>torus</b> to the Klein bottle, because {{two copies of}} the fundamental region of the Klein bottle, one being placed next to the {{mirror image of the}} other, yield a fundamental region of the <b>torus.</b> The universal cover of both the <b>torus</b> and the Klein bottle is the plane R2.|$|E
25|$|When {{a complex}} <b>torus</b> carries the {{structure}} of an algebraic variety, this structure is necessarily unique. In the case g = 1, the notion of abelian variety {{is the same as}} that of elliptic curve, and every complex <b>torus</b> gives rise to such a curve; for g > 1 it has been known since Riemann that the algebraic variety condition imposes extra constraints on a complex <b>torus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Lawson {{conjecture}} {{states that}} every minimally embedded <b>torus</b> in the 3-sphere with the round metric {{must be a}} Clifford <b>torus.</b> This conjecture was proved by Simon Brendle in 2012.|$|E
25|$|A complex <b>torus</b> of {{dimension}} g is a <b>torus</b> of real dimension 2g {{that carries}} {{the structure of a}} complex manifold. It can always be obtained as the quotient of a g-dimensional complex vector space by a lattice of rank 2g.|$|E
25|$|In topology, a ring <b>torus</b> is homeomorphic to the Cartesian {{product of}} two circles: S1×S1, {{and the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring <b>torus</b> {{is one way to}} embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another {{way to do this is}} the Cartesian product of the embedding of S1 in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford <b>torus,</b> a surface in 4-space.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{described}} above, {{given the}} relative topology from R3, is homeomorphic to a topological <b>torus</b> {{as long as}} it does not intersect its own axis. A particular homeomorphism is given by stereographically projecting the topological <b>torus</b> into R3 from the north pole of S3.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the theory}} of {{elliptic}} functions, it can be shown that elliptic curves defined over the complex numbers correspond to embeddings of the <b>torus</b> into the complex projective plane. The <b>torus</b> is also an abelian group, and in fact this correspondence is also a group isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|When , the <b>torus</b> degenerates to the sphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{covering}} {{factor of}} the <b>torus</b> might {{play an important}} role. Some <b>torus</b> models predict how Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the <b>torus</b> covering factor, something supported by studies in the x-ray of AGN. The models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in Seyfert 1s to more “dead” Seyfert 2s and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities {{and the evolution of}} the broad-line region.|$|E
25|$|The graph {{is named}} after Percy John Heawood, who in 1890 proved that in every {{subdivision}} of the <b>torus</b> into polygons, the polygonal regions can be colored by at most seven colors. The Heawood graph forms a subdivision of the <b>torus</b> with seven mutually adjacent regions, showing that this bound is tight.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a <b>torus</b> (plural tori) is {{a surface}} of {{revolution}} generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis coplanar with the circle. If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a <b>torus</b> of revolution.|$|E
25|$|They are homeomorphic to the <b>torus</b> bundles {b; (n1, 2);}.|$|E
25|$|Some bifurcations {{can lead}} to very {{complicated}} structures in phase space. For example, the RuelleTakens scenario describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a <b>torus</b> and the <b>torus</b> into a strange attractor. In another example, Feigenbaum period-doubling describes how a stable periodic orbit goes {{through a series of}} period-doubling bifurcations.|$|E
25|$|The Heawood graph is a {{toroidal}} graph; that is, {{it can be}} embedded without crossings onto a <b>torus.</b> One embedding of {{this type}} places its vertices and edges into three-dimensional Euclidean space as the set of vertices and edges of a nonconvex polyhedron with the topology of a <b>torus,</b> the Szilassi polyhedron.|$|E
25|$|For example, the <b>torus</b> has Euler {{characteristic}} χ = 0 (and genus g = 1) {{and thus}} p = 7, so {{no more than}} 7 colors are required to color any map on a <b>torus.</b> This upper bound of 7 is sharp: certain toroidal polyhedra such as the Szilassi polyhedron require seven colors.|$|E
25|$|In theory, a nanotorus is {{a carbon}} {{nanotube}} bent into a <b>torus</b> (doughnut shape). Nanotori are predicted {{to have many}} unique properties, such as magnetic moments 1000 times larger than previously expected for certain specific radii. Properties such as magnetic moment, thermal stability, etc. vary widely depending on radius of the <b>torus</b> and radius of the tube.|$|E
25|$|A <b>torus</b> {{is said to}} be {{anisotropic}} if its F-rank is zero.|$|E
