5|$|In May, Shōkaku and Zuikaku were {{assigned}} to a mission to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were transferred to Truk in July. In response to the carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, the carriers {{and much of the}} fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Shōkaku and Zuikaku and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk. At the beginning of November, the bulk of their air groups were transferred to Rabaul to bolster the defenses there, just in time to help defend the port against the Allied attack a few days later. They accomplished little there, for the loss of over half their number, before returning to Truk on the 13th. The sisters returned to Japan in December.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company does not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E

Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner.

5|$|Both Task Forces {{needed to}} refuel, but TF 17 {{finished}} first and Fletcher took Yorktown and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May. TF 11 {{was ordered to}} rendezvous with TF 17 and TF 44, the old ANZAC Squadron, further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May. Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day. The air strike on Tulagi confirmed {{that at least one}} American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had no idea of its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One H6K flying boat spotted Yorktown, but was shot down by one of Yorktowns Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Force (USAAF) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{country on}} {{the eastern side of the}} Judean Hills falls into the Jordan Valley in a {{confused}} mass of rocky ridges and deep narrow valleys. All the main wadis run from west to east; often with steep high banks, while the tributaries joined from all directions, breaking up the ridges making the hills, almost impossible to cross. Most tracks ran along the narrow beds of ravines where progress had to be made in single file. Further north at Jebel Kuruntul (also known as Jebel Quruntul, the Mount of Temptation and Mount Quarantania) the mountains end abruptly in a 1,000-foot (300 m) cliff. Sometimes the attacking parties had to haul themselves and each other over abrupt cliffs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to fight at close quarters at the top.

25|$|During the 1993/94 {{international}} season, Wessels' cricketing career reached full circle, as he captained the South African {{side in a}} tour to Australia. The first Test {{match of}} the tour, in Melbourne, was drawn. The second, and arguably most memorable, test was played {{out in front of}} a capacity crowd in Sydney. It turned out to be Wessels' last match of the tour, following a hand injury during play. Shane Warne took seven wickets in the first innings and everything seemed lost for the South Africans. However, thanks to some heroic bowling and batting by the visitors, Australia was eventually set a winning target of 117 runs in the second innings. The home side was bowled out for 110 runs, and South Africa won their first Test match against Australia since 1969. Wessels was forced to return to South Africa because of his injury, thus missing out {{on the rest of the}} tour. He was, however, immediately reinstated as captain for the home series against Australia. The series was drawn 1–1, and Wessels was criticised for 'baffling' captaincy in the final Test by failing to declare and allowing the tail to score slowly when South Africa seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to win the match and the series.|$|E
