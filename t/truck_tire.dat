25|$|Months later, {{after the}} {{forensic}} testing had been inconclusive, FBI agent Ron Butkiewicz {{read the newspaper}} story, contacted O'Malley, and they toured the location together on April 6, 1992. Upon re-interviewing Lodzinski's friends and family, Butkiewitz learned that she had once worked and taken frequent walks at the Raritan Center complex, within a few blocks of the sneaker's discovery, although Lodzinski herself omitted just this location when investigators had asked for her complete employment history. On April 23–24, 1992, law enforcement teams conducted a full search of the area. They quickly located a matching second sneaker in Timmy's size, and then found the boy's partial skeletal remains in and around a <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> in Red Root Creek, near pieces of his clothing, a Ninja Turtles balloon, and a blue blanket. His identity was confirmed through dental records, and his death was ruled a homicide, although the time, location, and medical cause of death could not be determined due to advanced decomposition.|$|E

Goodyear granted 50 licenses on the tire building machine and made an estimated $2,000,000 in royalties. By 1913, over half of the tires made in the U.S. were manufactured on the Seiberling State machine. [...] F.A. and Goodyear received additional patents for creating the first universal tire rim, introducing the double diamond all weather tire tread, and inventing a pneumatic <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> which eventually replaced the industry standard solid <b>truck</b> <b>tire.</b> By 1916, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company was the largest tire producer in the world.|$|E

50|$|His next feat {{took place}} in December 2014 and {{involved}} flipping a 250-pound <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> 13 miles, attempting the feat one day after he lost his father. The initial plan was for McCastle to flip the tire along a 13-mile stretch of road where he was stationed Oak Harbor, Washington. He could not secure the requisite municipal permits for the journey and ended up flipping the tire in a parking lot. The stretch of pavement was 500 feet, and McCastle flipped the tire across that stretch 137 times to equal 13 miles. The feat took around 10 hours to complete. In the process, McCastle raised $700 for the Wounded Warrior Project. The feat is generally considered a world record for the longest distance traveled while flipping a 250-pound <b>truck</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|E

50|$|Polybutadiene {{is largely}} used {{in various parts}} of {{automobile}} tires; the manufacture of tires consumes about 70% of the world production of polybutadiene, with a majority of it being high cis. The polybutadiene is used primarily in the sidewall of <b>truck</b> <b>tires,</b> this helps to improve fatigue to failure life due to the continuous flexing during run. As a result, tires will not blow out in extreme service conditions. It is also used in the tread portion of giant <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> to improve the abrasion, i.e. less wearing, and to run the tire comparatively cool, since the internal heat comes out quickly. Both parts are formed by extrusion.|$|R
