40|$|Recently, several {{database}} watermarking {{techniques have}} been developed to fight against database piracy. In watermarking, a database owner’s identification information is embedded into a database such that proof of ownership can be established by detecting the information in pirated data. However, most watermarking systems are vulnerable to the severe threat of additive attacks and this threat has not been studied formally. In an additive attack, a pirate inserts an additional watermark such that the proof of ownership becomes ambiguous. In this paper, we present an effective approach to defending against additive attacks. Our strategy is to raise the errors introduced during watermark insertion to a predetermined threshold such that any additive attack would introduce more errors than the <b>threshold.</b> <b>Exceeding</b> the error threshold means that the pirated data is less useful or less competitive; thus, the owner does not need to claim ownership for such pirated data...|$|E
40|$|Play {{audiometry}} {{is part of}} {{the general}} developmental screening covering 4 -year-old children in the city of Malmo (Sweden). In an open study, 10 % of the cohort was tested with transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), using the ILO 88 system. The aim was to reveal a hearing loss exceeding 25 dB HL in 4 -year-old children. As the first step in determining whether emissions can be used as an efficient method of screening for hearing loss, 295 children were tested with TEOAEs. Audiometry was performed in 160 children. Audiometry was not performed if the TEOAEs were strong (> or = 10 dB SPL) in both ears. In the group with TEOAEs of 8. 8 dB SPL or greater, all ears tested with audiometry had a pure-tone average (PTA) of 25 dB HL or better. Twenty-one percent of the ears had TEOAEs < or = 0 dB SPL. Only 9 % of the ears had a hearing <b>threshold</b> <b>exceeding</b> 25 dB HL (PTA). In conclusions, the number of pathological TEOAE results was much larger than the number of pathological audiograms, making TEOAEs too sensitive to use as a single screening test, but the method may be used as first-line screening...|$|E

We report here, to our knowledge, the first systematic analysis of circadian rhythm activity in pedigrees segregating severe BP (BP-I). By analyzing actigraphy {{data obtained from}} members of 26 Costa Rican and Colombian pedigrees [136 euthymic (i. e., interepisode) BP-I individuals and 422 non-BP-I relatives], we delineated 73 phenotypes, of which 49 demonstrated significant heritability and 13 showed significant trait-like association with BP-I. All BP-I-associated traits related to activity level, with BP-I individuals consistently demonstrating lower activity levels than their non-BP-I relatives. We analyzed all 49 heritable phenotypes using genetic linkage analysis, with special emphasis on phenotypes judged to have the strongest impact on the biology underlying BP. We identified a locus for interdaily stability of activity, at a <b>threshold</b> <b>exceeding</b> genome-wide significance, on chromosome 12 pter, a region that also showed pleiotropic linkage to two additional activity phenotypes.

40|$|The Schelling {{segregation}} model {{attempts to}} ex-plain possible causes of racial segregation in cities. Schelling considered residents of two types, where ev-eryone prefers {{that the majority}} of his or her neigh-bors are of the same type. He showed through sim-ulations that even mild preferences of this type can lead to segregation if residents move whenever they are not happy with their local environments. We gen-eralize the Schelling model to include a broad class of bias functions determining individuals happiness or desire to move, called the General Influence Model. We show that for any influence function in this class, the dynamics will be rapidly mixing and cities will be integrated (i. e., there will not be clustering) if the racial bias is sufficiently low. Next we show com-plementary results for two broad classes of influence functions: Increasing Bias Functions (IBF), where an individual's likelihood of moving increases each time someone of the same color leaves (this does not in-clude Schelling's threshold models), and Threshold Bias Functions (TBF) with the <b>threshold</b> <b>exceeding</b> one half, reminiscent of the model Schelling originally proposed. For both classes (IBF and TBF), we show that when the bias is sufficiently high, the dynamics take exponential time to mix and we will have segre-gation and a large "ghetto" will form...|$|E
40|$|The {{mixing layer}} height (MLH) {{is a crucial}} {{parameter}} in order to investigate the near surface concentrations of air pollutants. The MLH can be estimated by measurements of some atmospheric variables, by indirect estimates based on trace gases concentration or aerosol, or by numerical models. Here, a modelling approach is proposed. The developed modelling system {{is based on the}} models WRF-ARW and CALMET. This system is applied on Firenze-Prato-Pistoia area (Central Italy), during 2010, and it is compared with in situ measurements. The aim of this work is to evaluate the use of MLH model estimates to characterize the critical episodes for PM 10 in a limited area. In order to find out the meteorological conditions predisposing accumulation of PM 10 in the atmosphere’s lower level, some indicators are used: daily mean wind speed, cumulated rainfall, and mean MLH estimates from CALMET model. This indicator is linked to orography, which has important consequences on local weather dynamics. However, during critical events the local emission sources are crucial to the determination of <b>threshold</b> <b>exceeding</b> of PM 10.

40|$|A {{principal}} {{difference between}} flame spread over solid fuels and over liquid fuels is, {{in the latter}} case, the presence of liquid-phase convection ahead of {{the leading edge of}} the flame. The details of the fluid dynamics and heat transfer mechanisms in both the pulsating and uniform flame spread regimes were heavily debated, without resolution, in the 1960 s and 1970 s; recently, research on flame spread over pools was reinvigorated by the advent of enhanced diagnostic techniques and computational power. Temperature fields in the liquid, which enable determination of the extent of preheating ahead of the flame, were determined previously by the use of thermocouples and repetitive tests, and suggested that the surface temperature does not decrease monotonically ahead of the pulsating flame front, but that there exists a surface temperature valley. Recent predictions support this suggestion. However, others' thermocouple measurements and the recent field measurements using Holographic Interferometry (HI) did not find a similar valley. In this work we examine the temperature field using Rainbow Schlieren Deflectometry (RSD), with a measurement <b>threshold</b> <b>exceeding</b> that of conventional interferometry by a factor of 20 : 1, for uniform and pulsating flame spread using propanol and butanol as fuels. This technique was not applied before to flame spread over liquid pools, except in some preliminary measurements reported earlier. Noting that HI is sensitive to the refractive index while RSD responds to refractive index gradients, and that these two techniques might therefore be difficult to compare, we utilized a numerical simulation, described below, to predict and compare both types of field for the uniform and pulsating spread regimes. The experimental data also allows a validation of the model at a level of detail greater than has been attempted before...|$|E

DESIGN : A repeated-measure within-subject study design was employed whereby air conduction hearing thresholds determined by smartphone-based audiometry was compared to conventional audiometry in a sound booth and primary health care clinic environment. STUDY SAMPLE : 94 subjects (mean age 41 years ± 17. 6 SD and range 18 - 88; 64 % female) were assessed of whom 64 were tested in the sound booth and 30 within primary health care clinics without a booth. RESULTS : In the sound booth 63. 4 % of conventional and smartphone thresholds indicated normal hearing (≤ 15 dBHL). Conventional <b>thresholds</b> <b>exceeding</b> 15 dB HL corresponded to smartphone thresholds within ≤ 10 dB in 80. 6 % of cases with an average threshold difference of - 1. 6 dB ± 9. 9 SD.
