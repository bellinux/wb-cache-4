50|$|In 1971, <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> {{was officially}} {{standardized}} after the state's chief {{deputy attorney general}} discovered {{that there was more}} than one version in use. In 1983, state Senator Julian R. Allsbrook proposed a revision <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> date April 12, 1776, the date of the Halifax Resolves; this revision was approved by the state legislature. These two dates are also on the flag of North Carolina.|$|R
5|$|In fourth quarter, {{the speed}} of the game {{accelerated}} as Duke began to push offensively. Johns Hopkins goaltender Michael Gvozden was up to the task. He recorded 7 of his 17 saves in the fourth quarter, including one as time expired <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> victory.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. The holders equalised and {{took the lead in}} quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to}} be highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{finished}} road, {{while an}} improvement over the previous route, still was {{not much more than}} a track, and remained such throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> highway began in Norseman in 1960, with the Western Australian section completed in 1969 and the South Australian section finished in 1976. Further improvement works have been undertaken since the 1980s, including widening and reconstructing portions of the road.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures.

In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 some {{fishermen}} {{claimed to}} have suffered damage to their nets which they attributed <b>to</b> <b>seals.</b> <b>The</b> Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game at the time suspected {{that some of the}} damage had not been done by seals, but rather by sharks.

5|$|After {{giving the}} {{impression}} that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by Mongol cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the Battle of Rusokastro. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge within the walls of Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo. <b>To</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, {{but it was not until}} 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E

5|$|After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} abandon the programme {{out of concern for}} the astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate as}} to when the {{conflict}} started. Proposed dates for the first war are either 547 or 549. At {{the same time as}} the two peoples took the field, a 10,000-strong Byzantine horse army under the command of John, the magister militum of Illyricum, marched against the Gepids. Before John's arrival, Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted. As a result, when the Byzantines arrived, the war had already ended, but not before they had clashed with the Gepids' Herulian allies. <b>To</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> truce, Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up Ildigis, a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court. Thurisind refused, but he did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge.|$|E

Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> only bridge leading to the mainland.
