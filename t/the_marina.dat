5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or <b>the</b> <b>marina</b> have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Civic District Master Plan public {{exhibition}} was held from 22–26 February by the URA.

The URA explained that the 380m long tunnel would help smoothen the major traffic intersection in front of Cathay Building and direct heavy traffic away from <b>the</b> <b>Marina</b> to Orchard areas, thus giving the museum precinct a peaceful and quiet ambience.|$|E

The Medway Queen Club, as {{it was going to}} be called, was to be the centre-piece of <b>the</b> Medway Queen <b>Marina.</b> Having been due to be scrapped before this, the Daily Mail set up a campaign to save her and she was duly rescued by the Ridetts, together with various preservation trusts, who paid £6,000 to buy her from a Belgian breaking company.
