Choosing the <b>terminal</b> <b>anchor</b> point of the first cubic poly-Bezier curve as previously described ensures that the inflection point of PSC is contained in the first cubic poly-Bezier and gives the ability to objectively determine the true position of inflection point on PSC as well as its Torque_Value^Angle through accurate mathematical procedures.|$|R

The pathological changes were related to attachment, feeding and parasite size, and comprised progressive mechanical erosion, epithelial hyperplasia and fibrosis. When present, infiltrating cells were associated with initial attachment by the copepodid and with the frontal filament basal plate. Approximately 2. 4 % of the respiratory area was lost as a result of direct vascular damage. Disruption of branchial blood flow resulted from the burrowing and feeding activities of the larvae and compression of adjacent vessels as the parasite increased in size.

The BDV glycoprotein (G) is an extensively glycosylated protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 84, 000 to 94, 000 kilodaltons (kDa). BDV G is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular subtilisin-like protease furin into two subunits, a 41 kDa amino terminal protein GP 1 and a 43 kDa carboxyl terminal protein GP 2.

40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal. An analysis of several cable guardrail end terminals was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension cable end terminal designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current cable <b>terminal</b> <b>anchor</b> hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal.

For a wide variety of molecules conducting by phase coherent tunneling, conductance G decays with length following the relationship G = Aexp-η̱L. It is widely accepted that the attenuation coefficient η̱ is determined by the position of the Fermi energy of the electrodes relative to the energy of frontier orbitals of the molecular bridge, whereas the <b>terminal</b> <b>anchor</b> groups which bind to the molecule to the electrodes contribute to the pre-exponential factor A. We examine this premise for several series of molecules which contain a central conjugated moiety (phenyl, viologen or α-terthiophene) connected on either side to alkane chains of varying length, with each end terminated by thiol or thiomethyl anchor groups. In contrast with this expectation, we demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that additional electronic states located on thiol anchor groups can significantly decrease the value of e̱ṯa̱, by giving rise to resonances close to EF through coupling to the bridge moiety. This interplay between the gateway states and their coupling to a central conjugated moiety in the molecular bridges creates a new design strategy for realising higher-transmission molecular wires by taking advantage of the electrode-molecule interface properties...|$|R

This a condition where benign tumours of the blood vessels undergo uncontrolled proliferation, causing knots to form in the smaller blood vessels, such as capillaries, restricting the flow of blood. This may be due to BadA's inducing the transcription of proangiogenic factors, as it activates of NF-κB as well as hypoxia-inducible factor 1. The head domain of BadA is more complex than other TAAs. It is thought to be a chimera or, in other words, a combination of YadA and Hia head domains.

Recombinant rootletin forms detergent-insoluble filaments radiating from the centrioles and resembling rootlets found in vivo.

However, only one, PBP 5, has a demonstrated physiological function. In its absence, certain mutants of E. coli have altered diameters and lose their uniform outer contour, resulting in morphologically aberrant cells. To determine what differentiates the activities of these LMW PBPs, we constructed fusion proteins combining portions of PBP 5 with fragments of other dd-carboxypeptidases to see which hybrids restored normal morphology to a strain lacking PBP 5. Functional complementation occurred when truncated PBP 5 was combined with the <b>terminal</b> membrane <b>anchor</b> sequences of PBP 6 or DacD. However, complementation was not restored by the putative carboxy-terminal anchor of PBP 4 or by a transmembrane region of the osmosensor protein ProW, even though these hybrids were membrane bound.

A functional fusion protein was produced by combining the N-terminal enzymatic domain of PBP 5 with the C-terminal β-sheet domain of PBP 6. In contrast, the opposite hybrid of PBP 6 to PBP 5 was not functional. The {{results suggest that the}} mode of PBP 5 membrane anchoring is important, that the mechanism entails more than a simple mechanical tethering of the enzyme to the outer face of the inner membrane, and that the physiological differences among the LMW PBPs arise from structural differences in the dd-carboxypeptidase enzymatic core...|$|R

While AZO 1 allows for a coplanar arrangement of both biphenyl subunits, additional steric repulsion due to two methyl side groups attached to the footing biphenyl of AZO 2 results in an increased intermolecular distance within the SAM, providing additional free volume. SAMs of both derivatives on gold and platinum substrates have been formed and thoroughly investigated by photoelectron (XPS) and near-edge absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry and scanning tunneling microscopy. These measurements confirmed the formation of tightly packed SAMs for AZO 1, while AZO 2 formed SAMs consisting of less organized and more loosely packed molecules.

The thermally induced cis → trans back reaction on AZO 1 was found to be slower by a factor of 3 in SAMs as compared to solution, while AZO 2 displayed comparable rates of the back reaction in both environments.

40|$|Lactase-phlorizin {{hydrolase}} (LPH), a major {{digestive enzyme}} {{in the small}} intestine of newborns, is synthesized as a high-molecular-mass precursor comprising four tandemly repeated domains. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor liberates the pro segment (LPHalpha) corresponding to domains I and II and devoid of known enzymic function. The mature enzyme (LPHbeta) comprises domains III and IV and is anchored in the brush border membrane via a C-terminal hydrophobic segment. To analyse {{the roles of the}} different domains of LPHalpha and LPHbeta, and the interactions between them, we have engineered a series of modified derivatives of the rat LPH precursor. These were expressed in cultured cells under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The results show that recombinant LPHbeta harbouring both domains III and IV produces lactase activity. Neither domain III nor IV is alone sufficient to generate active enzyme, although the corresponding proteins are transport-competent. Tandem duplication of domains III or IV did not restore lactase activity, demonstrating the separate roles of both domains within LPHbeta. Further, the development of lactase activity did not require LPHalpha; however, LPHalpha potentiated the production of active LPHbeta but the individual LPHalpha subdomains I and II were unable to do so. Lactase activity and targeting required the C-terminal transmembrane anchor of LPH; this requirement was <b>terminal</b> transmembrane <b>anchor</b> or LPH; this requirement was not satisfied by the signal/anchor region of another digestive enzyme: sucrase-isomaltase. On the basis of this study we suggest that multiple levels of intramolecular interactions occur within the LPH precursor to produce the mature enzyme, and that the repeat domains of the precursor have distinct and specific functions in protein processing, substrate recognition and catalysis. We propose a functional model of LPHbeta in which substrate is channelled from an entry point located within domain II to the active site located in domain IV...|$|R
40|$|Molecules due {{to their}} very small sizes, possess {{discrete}} energy levels and electrons can transmit {{from one side of}} the molecule to the other with high probability if their energy coincides with molecular energy levels. In the weak coupling limit such on-resonance electron transport is described by the simple Lorentzian-shaped Breit-Wigner formula. On the other hand, electrons with energy different than the molecular energy levels have to tunnel through the energy gap between two molecular energy levels (off resonance transmission). Consequently the electron transmission probability is much smaller than on resonance regime. Interesting phenomena including quantum interference could be observed in this regime at room temperature. In this thesis, I discuss both regimes though, my main aim is to introduce a new theory called ”mid- gap theory” to predict the conductance ratio between different connectivities driven by quantum interference (QI) in the tunneling regime. Both theory and experiment have focused primarily on elucidating the conditions for the appearance of constructive or destructive interference. In the simplest case, where electrons are injected at the Fermi energy EF of the electrodes, constructive QI arises when EF coincides with a delocalized energy level En of the molecule. Similarly a simple form of destructive QI occurs when EF coincides with the energy Eb of a bound state located on a pendant moiety. Unless energy levels are tuned by electrostatic, electrochemical or mechanical gating, molecules located within a junction rarely exhibit these types of QI, because EF is usually located in the HOMO-LUMO (H-L) gap. Furthermore few analytic formulas are available, which means that pre-screening of molecules often requires expensive numerical simulations. For this reason, discussions have often focused on conditions for destructive or constructive QI when EF is located at the centre of the H-L gap. In this thesis, based on a simple description of connectivity, I demonstrate that the conductance ratio between two different connectivities of a core molecule could be predicted simply by using the ratio between two magic numbers of the core molecule. This will be discussed in the chapters 4 - 6. This simple theory not only predicts conductance ratios, but it could be used also to propose new strategies for molecular electronic design and applications such as single molecule switches and thermoelectricity. In this thesis after an introduction to nano and molecular electronics, I discuss general ideas about nanoscale transport and the methods which could be applied to model nano and molecular scale devices. In chapter 3, on resonance transport is discussed. For a wide variety of molecules, the conductance G decays with length L as Aexp(−βL) and it is widely accepted that the attenuation coefficient β is determined by position of the Fermi energy of the electrodes relative to the energy gap of the molecular bridge, whereas the <b>terminal</b> <b>anchor</b> groups which bind the molecule to the electrodes contribute to A. In contrast with this expectation, in chapter 3, I demonstrate that gateway orbitals located on the anchor groups can significantly decrease the value of β, thereby creating a new design strategy for realizing low-conductance molecular wires. In chapters 4 - 6, I introduce mid-gap theory and drive a mid-gap ratio rule (MRR) which is an exact formula for conductance ratios of tight-binding representations of molecules in the weak coupling limit, when the Fermi energy is located at the centre of the HOMO-LUMO (H-L) gap. It does not depend on the size of the H-L gap and is independent of asymmetries in the contacts. I also show how conductance ratios change, when one of the carbon atoms within the parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) core is replaced by a heteroatom to yield a daughter molecule. I show that this heteroatom substitution could be used to enhance the conductance in a PAH molecule by several orders of magnitude. A good agreement between this new simple theory and experiment shows that, the MRR provides a useful tool to predict the conductances of PAH molecules prior to synthesis. Therefore it could be used to design molecules with desirable properties or to propose new molecular devices...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{bacterial}} polysaccharides (PSs) which contain a terminal lipid moiety. It has been postulated that these <b>terminal</b> lipid moieties <b>anchor</b> the PSs {{to the outer}} membrane of the bacteria. Our {{studies have shown that}} incubation of native PS from group C Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae type b with isolated outer membrane vesicles results in association of a portion of the PS with the vesicles. Removal of the terminal lipid from the PS by treatment with phospholipase A 2 or phospholipase D eliminates this association. In other studies, it was shown that delipidated PSs are not suitable as solid-phase antigens in a currently used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Measurement of antibody units in the reference sera by using delipidated PSs as antigens in an ELISA yielded negligible absorbance compared with native PSs when methylated human serum albumin was used to coat the PSs to the plate. Nevertheless, phospholipase A 2 and phospholipase D treatment did not noticeably affect antigenic epitopes, since soluble group C PS without the terminal lipid bound antibody as effectively as the native PS did, as measured by a competitive inhibition assay. Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are important for the binding of group C N. meningitidis PS to the ELISA plate, while charge interactions seem to be sufficient for binding the more negatively charged H. influenzae type b PS...|$|R
40|$|A new {{screening}} procedure is described that uses docking calculations to design enhanced agonist peptides that bind to {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class I receptors. The screening process proceeds via single mutations of one amino acid at the positions that directly interact with the MHC receptor. The energetic and structural effects of these mutations have been studied using fragments of the original ligand that vary in length. The results of these docking studies indicate that the mutant affinity ranking of long peptides can be practically reproduced with a screening approach performed using fragments of six residues. Fragments of four and five residues could mimic, in some cases, the structural arrangement of the side chains of the full-length peptide. We have compared the structural and energetic results of the docking calculations with experimental data using three unrelated ligand peptides that differ greatly in their affinity for the MHC complex. Analysis of the affinity of the fragments led to the identification of three important parameters {{in the construction of}} fragments that mimic the structural and energetic properties of the full-length ligand: the length of the fragment; its intermolecular energy; and the number and localization, internal or <b>terminal,</b> of the <b>anchor</b> residues. The results of this new peptide-design methodology have been applied to suggest new peptides derived from the MUC 1 – 8 peptide that could be used as murine vaccines that trigger the immune response through the MHC class I protein H- 2 Kb...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{synthesis}} and {{targeting of}} membrane proteins that contain hydrophobic transmembrane domains are mediated by chaperones and targeting factors. Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are a special class of membrane proteins that {{are characterized by}} a single carboxy (C) <b>terminal</b> helix that <b>anchors</b> them to biological membranes. Fungal Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway components, which include four soluble proteins—Sgt 2, Get 3, Get 4, Get 5 —and two membrane bound receptors—Get 1 and Get 2 —mediate TA biogenesis. These proteins maintain TA protein solubility in the aqueous cytosol and target TA to the endoplasmic reticulum. While most of the components are conserved in metazoans, one additional protein, Bag 6, reorganizes the sorting complex from the heterotetrameric Get 4 - 5 to the heterotrimeric Bag 6 -TRC 35 -Ubl 4 A. To understand the molecular architecture and mechanism of the Bag 6 complex, we took a multidisciplinary approach that combines x-ray crystallography, biochemical reconstitution, and cell biology. Our studies demonstrate that the BAG domain of Bag 6 is not a canonical BAG domain. Instead, main role of the Bag 6 'mock' BAG domain is to dimerize with Ubl 4 A. Furthermore, the truncated Bag 6 complex defined {{in this study is}} sufficient to facilitate substrate transfer from SGTA to TRC 40. Lastly, our results unequivocally establish TRC 35 as a cytoplasmic retention factor for Bag 6. These results provide structural, biochemical and cell biological bases for modular Bag 6 function and regulation of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Bag 6 by TRC 35...|$|R
40|$|C-H {{stretching}} {{bands in}} the infrared spectrum of single crystals of nominally high purity, laboratory-grown MgO and of natural upper mantle olivine provide an "organic" signature that closely resembles the symmetrical and asymmetrical C-H stretching modes of aliphatic -CH 2 - units. The C-H stretching bands indicate that H 20 and CO 2, dissolved in the matrix of these minerals, converted to form H 2 and chemically reduced C, which in turn formed C-H entities, probably through segregation into defects such as dislocations. Heating causes the C-H bonds to pyrolyze and the C-H stretching bands to disappear, but annealing at 70 C causes them to reappear {{within a few days}} or weeks. Modeling dislocations in MgO suggests that the segregation of C can lead to Cx chains, x {{less than or equal to}} 4, with the <b>terminal</b> C atoms <b>anchored</b> to the MgO matrix by bonding to two U. Allowing H 2 to react with such Cx chains leads to [O 2 C(CH 2) 2 CO 2] or similar precipitates. It is suggested that such Cx-Hy-Oz entities represent protomolecules from which derive the short-chain carboxylic and dicarboxylic and of the medium-chain fatty acids that have been solvent-extracted from crushed MgO and olivine single crystals, respectively. Thus it appears that the hard, dense matrix of igneous minerals represents a medium in which protomolecular units can be assembled. During weathering of rocks the protomolecular units turn into complex organic molecules. These processes may have provided stereochemically constrained organics to the early Earth that were crucial to the emergence of Life...|$|R
