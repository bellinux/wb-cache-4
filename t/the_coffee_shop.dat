40|$|Background <b>The</b> Dutch <b>coffee</b> <b>shop</b> {{policy was}} {{tightened}} in 2012. Two additional criteria that <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> must adhere {{to in order}} for them to be tolerated came into force: the private club and <b>the</b> residence criterion. <b>Coffee</b> <b>shops</b> were only permitted to give access to members and only residents of the Netherlands were permitted to become a member. This tightened policy sought to make <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> smaller and more controllable, to reduce the nuisance associated with <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> and to reduce the number of foreign visitors attracted by <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>shops.</b> Enforcement began in the southern provinces. The private club criterion was abolished at the end of 2012. Methods A sample of fourteen municipalities with <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> was drawn. Seven in the south were treated as an ‘experimental group’ and the others as ‘comparison group’. A baseline assessment and follow-ups at six and 18 months were performed. A combination of methods was applied: interviews with local experts, surveys with neighbourhood residents, <b>coffee</b> <b>shop</b> visitors and cannabis users, and ethnographic field work. Results Drugs tourism to <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> swiftly declined in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> also lost a large portion of their local customers, since users did not want to register as a member. The illegal market expanded. Neighbourhood residents experienced a greater amount of nuisance caused by dealer activities. After abolishment of the private club criterion, residents of the Netherlands largely returned to <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>shops.</b> Drug tourists still remained largely absent. Neighbourhood residents experienced more nuisance from <b>coffee</b> <b>shops</b> again. Illegal cannabis sale was tempered. No effect on cannabis use was found. Conclusion The quick and robust shifts in the users’ market in reaction to the policy changes illustrate the power of policy, but also the limitations caused by the dynamic and resilient nature of the Dutch cannabis supply market...|$|R

25|$|When {{analysing}} the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can {{be drawn}} when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating soft drugs {{can be seen as}} the defeat of the government against hedonism. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and hashish has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect. <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>shop</b> will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though there was a slight increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.|$|E
