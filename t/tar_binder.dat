40|$|The {{interaction}} between the arginine-rich motif (ARM) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein and TAR RNA is essential for Tat activation and viral replication. Two related lentiviruses, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and Jembrana disease virus (JDV), also require Tat ARM-TAR interactions to mediate activation, but the viruses have evolved different RNA-binding strategies. Interestingly, the JDV ARM {{can act as a}} “chameleon, ” adopting both the HIV and BIV TAR binding modes. To examine how RNA-protein interactions may evolve in a viral context and possibly to identify peptides that recognize HIV TAR in novel ways, we devised a retroviral system based on HIV replication to amplify and select for RNA binders. We constructed a combinatorial peptide library based on the BIV Tat ARM and identified peptides that, like the JDV Tat ARM, also function through HIV TAR, revealing unexpected sequence characteristics of an RNAbinding chameleon. The results suggest that a retroviral screening approach may help identify high-affinity <b>TAR</b> <b>binders</b> and may provide new insights into the evolution of RNA-protein interactions.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to develop a}} bench-scale {{procedure}} to design and fabricate advanced brake and structural composite materials from Illinois coal combustion residues. During {{the first quarter of the}} project, the thrust of the work was directed towards setting up the experimental facilities and undertaking preliminary tests to gauge the ability of coal <b>tar</b> derived <b>binder</b> in fabricating the brake skeletons. In addition systematic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted on PCC fly ash (Baldwin), fly ash (ADM), FBC fly ash, FBC spent bed bottom ash, bottom ash (ADM), and scrubber sludge residues to characterize their geometrical shape and thermal stability. The PCC fly ash particles being highly spherical in shape and thermally inert up to 1100 {degrees}C will make an excellent raw material for our composites. This is born out by fabricating brake skeletons from PCC fly ash colloids. Unlike the PCC fly ash and FBC fly ash, the scrubber sludge particles are not suitable hosts for our brake lining materials because of a whisker-like particle structure.

Pyrolysis was carried out in order to produce tars. This work studies the effect of adding a sawdust waste on the characteristics of pyrolysis tars. In addition, the tars obtained from bio-briquettes and from biomass-free briquettes were compared. It was found that biomass reduces the amount of sulfur. The aromaticity of bio-tars was found to be lower than that of the tars from the biomass-free briquettes. They therefore contribute less to carcinogenicity, but they have more oxygenated groups.

40|$|Tar-containing {{antiskid}} surface layers {{are currently}} used on airfield runways. They {{have very good}} adhesion properties and an excellent fuel resistance, which make them outstanding compared to other surface layers with bitumen as binder. However, tar-containing products have a high Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) content. They are toxic and not environmental-friendly. Tar-containing products are not allowed in the Netherlands since 20 years ago, with one temporary exception for antiskid surfaces on runways. After 2010, {{it will not be}} allowed to apply such antiskid layers anymore. For this reason, alternatives to <b>tar</b> containing <b>binders</b> for antiskid runways are strongly required.

This paper focuses on the mechanical properties of tar-containing antiskid surface layers. A special Leutner shear test and an advanced pull test were designed to test the shear and tensile strength in the interface between the tar containing antiskid layer and the asphalt mixture layer below. Furthermore the antiskid binder was retrieved and DSR tests were performed to obtain the mechanical characteristics of the material.

40|$|Introduction This {{problem was}} brought to the 1997 European Study Group with Industry at the University of Bath by Svenn Anton Halvorsen of Elkem ASA, Kristiansand, Norway. It {{concerns}} a method for manufacturing continuous electrodes which are used in electric smelting furnaces. The purpose of such electrodes (of which {{there are a number of}} different types - see below for further details) is to conduct currents of up to 150, 000 Amps to the centre of a smelting furnace thereby providing the energy required to produce calcium carbide or ferro alloys. During a typical process the electrodes are consumed at a rate of about 0. 5 m/day and are normally charged by adding large (typically 1 m high cylinders of diameter up to 1 m) blocks of raw material to the top of the electrode. Central to the issues that will be discussed in this study is the raw material that makes the electrodes, which will hereafter be referred to as `paste'.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{industrial}} carbon electrodes {{are typically}} manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten coal <b>tar</b> pitch (the <b>binder)</b> and extruding the resultant mix {{to form the}} ‘green electrode’. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In case of usage as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit {{the body of the}} electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength. The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and th...|$|R
40|$|For {{ecological}} and economic reasons, there has {{in recent years}} been an increased tendency also to use broken-up asphalt {{in the manufacture of}} asphalt mixes. In the case of broken-up materials having higher tar contents, this is possible only with the aid of cold-processing methods. For this reason, the environmental compatibility and practical applicability of two of these methods were tested in experiments in the laboratory and on site. Use of granulated material having pure <b>tar</b> as a <b>binder</b> created a very critical boundary condition in terms of the material composition. The leached contents of harmful substances from granulated material with pure tar also showed that, for water conservation reasons, such a material cannot be used unbound. After binding of such tarry broken-up road materials with asphaltic emulsion and cement, or cement alone, the leaching is reduced, with the result that such construction material mixtures can be placed in base courses above a frost blanket course.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Applications of {{chromium}} {{vary widely}} (refractories, chemicals and metallurgical); however, the greatest benefit of chromium {{is its ability}} to improve the corrosion resistance, strength and hardness of steel. South Africa possesses approximately 75 % of the viable global chromite reserves and, as a result, dominates the ferrochrome market with production in excess of 5 million mega tonnes per year - making it an industry of extreme importance to the South African economy Submerged arc ferroalloy production furnaces mainly use Soderberg electrodes - self–baking continuous electrodes that are produced in situ during furnace operation. Electrode breakings may affect a furnace {{in a number of ways}} depending on the nature and location of the break. Low furnace power input, abnormal charging and tapping conditions, as well as loss of production are among the more common negative implications associated with electrode breaks. The successful operation of Soderberg electrodes is dependent on two main factors: high quality electrode paste and effective electrode management procedures. This study focused on electrode paste quality. The raw materials utilised in the production of Soderberg electrode paste consists of calcined anthracite mixed with a <b>tar</b> pitch <b>binder.</b> In this study the focus was on the development of an experimental procedure to measure the dimensional changes of electrode paste raw materials as a function of temperature by means of thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Three uncalcined anthracite (Zululand chips, Zululand duff, and Tendele duff) and two tar pitch samples (low and high softening point pitches, i. e. LSP and HSP) were obtained from a local paste producer. Electrode graphite samples were also obtained from a local pre–baked electrode supplier. The experimental procedure for both the anthracite and tar pitches consisted of two phases: sample preparation and TMA measurements. During the sample preparation procedure for the tar pitches, the two tar pitches were heat treated in order to prevent softening in the TMA (preventing possibly damage the instrument), where after pellets were pressed for TMA measurement. The anthracite samples were calcined at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C in the anthracite sample preparation phase. TMA sample pellets of calcined and uncalcined anthracite were pressed using only water as a binder. TMA was performed on pellets produced from the heat–treated tar pitch samples, uncalcined and calcined anthracite samples, as well as core drilled pellets of the pre–baked electrode graphite. The dimensional changes of these pellets were measured, as a function of temperature, through three consecutive heating (room temperature to 1300 °C) and cooling (1300 °C to approximately 100 °C) cycles under a N 2 atmosphere. A significant shrinkage (> 12 %) for both the LSP and HSP tar pitches occurred during the first TMA heating cycle. During the second and third heating cycles of the LSP and HSP tar pitches, dimensional changes were approximately 2 %. This indicates that substantial structural reordering of the carbonaceous binder takes place during the first heating cycle. TMA results obtained for all three the calcined anthracite samples investigated indicated thermal dimensional changes of less than 1 %. The anthracite samples calcined at the highest experimental calcination temperature (1400 °C) prior to TMA analysis had the smallest dimensional changes. This confirmed that higher calcination temperatures result in a higher level of structural ordering and dimensional stability. Considering the combined calcined anthracite and tar pitches TMA results, the importance of the initial baking of a Soderberg electrode at temperatures exceeding the baking isotherm temperature (475 °C) becomes apparent - the dimensional behaviour of the <b>tar</b> pitch <b>binder</b> and the calcined anthracite differ dramatically, making the newly–formed electrode very susceptible to breakage. Once structural reordering of the pitch had taken place, thermal dimensional behaviours of the materials are much more similar, significantly reducing the risk of thermal shock–induced electrode breakages. In contrast to the relatively small dimensional changes measured for the calcined anthracite samples, the shrinkages measured for the uncalcined samples during the first TMA heating/cooling cycle were substantial (6 – 8 %). This indicates the importance of the anthracite calcination process, before the electrode paste is formulated. Improperly calcined anthracite present in electrode paste would result in additional dimensional shrinkage that would have to be accommodated in the baking of a new electrode section. Considering the large shrinkage of the tar pitch that already takes place, it is unlikely that a strong enough electrode would be formed if this occurs. From the results, it also became apparent that the anthracite with the highest fixed carbon and lowest ash contents exhibited the smallest shrinkage during in situ TMA calcination. High fixed carbon, low ash type anthracites are therefore less prone to dimensional instabilities in Soderberg electrodes, as a result of poor calcination. The dimensional changes observed in the calcined anthracites were very similar to those observed for the electrode graphite samples. The expansions/shrinkages observed in the graphite samples were mostly less than 0. 5 %, whereas the expansions/shrinkages observed in the various calcined anthracites were approximately 0. 6 to 0. 9 %. The difference in the magnitude of the dimensional behaviour between the calcined anthracites and the graphite can be attributed to the fact that the graphite had already undergone maximum structural ordering (having been pre–baked at 3000 °C).

Apesar disso, investir no desenvolvimento desses materiais continua a ser necessário, sobretudo devido à crescente pressão para que o setor siderúrgico torne seus processos mais seguros e sustentáveis, objetivos esses que dependem diretamente do desempenho dos refratários utilizados ao longo da cadeia produtiva do ferro e do aço. Assim, com o intuito de indicar oportunidades de desenvolvimento ainda não exploradas, bem como de examinar as linhas de pesquisa que têm obtido êxito em aumentar a eficiência dos refratários contendo carbono, este trabalho faz uma ampla revisão dos possíveis constituintes destes materiais, tais como ligantes, fontes de carbono e aditivos diversos. Das inovações recentemente divulgadas, analisa-se o uso de adições combinadas de agentes antioxidantes e TiO 2 para promover o desenvolvimento de fases com morfologias especiais (como whiskers), e a descoberta de aditivos que possibilitam a grafitização do carbono produzido pelas resinas termofixas. Este último avanço é particularmente significativo, pois proporciona às resinas uma capacidade antes exclusiva do piche de alcatrão, ligante que vem sendo evitado pelas condições insalubres que causa tanto no ambiente da indústria siderúrgica como refratarista. Já entre as possibilidades de inovação cogitadas, destaca-se a adição de agentes de acoplagem aos refratários resinados com o objetivo de otimizar, sobretudo, a sua processabilidade. Tal avanço seria especialmente desejável para os concretos refratários resinados, materiais que atualmente possuem aplicações limitadas, mas que atraem grande interesse por suas diversas vantagens em relação aos produtos pré-conformados, o que os leva a ser um importante foco para novos desenvolvimentos. Due {{to their}} {{unique set of}} properties and characteristics, carbon containing refractories have been a key issue in order that the steelmaking industry could attain its current productivity levels. However, further development of these materials is still necessary, especially due to the increasing pressure on the steelmaking sector to make its processes safer and more sustainable, goals which directly depend {{on the performance of}} the refractories used for the iron and steel production chain. Thus, in order to identify opportunities not yet explored, as well as to examine the research lines that have been successful in increasing the carbon containing refractory performance, this paper presents an extensive review regarding likely components of these materials, such as binders, carbon sources and additives. Based on the innovations recently disclosed, it is pointed out the use of combined additions of antioxidants agents and TiO 2 to promote the development of phases with special morphologies (such as whiskers), and novel additives that enable the graphitization of the carbon from the thermosetting resins.
