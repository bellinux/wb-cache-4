5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E
5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> <b>in</b> a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> short-term and long-term interest rates. REITs were found to be sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the long-term interest rates in 1973 - 1979, but in 1980 - 1985, REITs were sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> both short-term and long-term rates. These sources of interest-rate sensitivity were also found to be different for equity and mortgage REITs. Equity REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation, whereas mortgage REITs are sensitive <b>to</b> both <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the real rate. ...|$|R

5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s, {{partly due to}} the discovery and development of North Sea oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E
5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} three seasons the Panthers played in {{regional}} leagues, {{first in the}} English League South and then in Section B of the British Hockey League. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers {{were one of the}} best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the Durham Wasps and the Murrayfield Racers. It was not until the appointment of Alex Dampier as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs {{for the first time since}} reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had shown}} {{independence}} in political matters {{as early as}} 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions. In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance {{with one of the}} main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Finishing 18th in the Premier League {{resulted}} in relegation to the Championship {{for the following}} season. The Norwich City board announced shortly after relegation was confirmed on 11 May 2014 that a new manager would be announced within the week. On 22 May 2014, Neil Adams was named as the permanent manager despite the relegation from this season and four defeats in five matches as caretaker manager. The upheaval at the club was not limited <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the management team, {{with a number of}} first team players being linked to moves away from Carrow Road, including Robert Snodgrass, Gary Hooper and John Ruddy.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the U. S. economy seems to have become less {{responsive}} <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> monetary policy.

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
