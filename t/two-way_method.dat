40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} differentially expressed genes across {{experimental conditions}} in oligonucleotide microarray experiments, existing statistical methods commonly use {{a summary of}} probe-level expression data for each probe set and compare replicates of these values across conditions using a form of the t -test or rank sum test. Here we propose {{the use of a}} statistical method that takes advantage of the built-in redundancy architecture of high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Results We employ parametric and nonparametric variants of two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on probe-level data to account for probe-level variation, and use the false-discovery rate (FDR) to account for simultaneous testing on thousands of genes (multiple testing problem). Using publicly available data sets, we systematically compared the performance of parametric two-way ANOVA and the nonparametric Mack-Skillings test to the t -test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for detecting differentially expressed genes at varying levels of fold change, concentration, and sample size. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparisons, we observed that <b>two-way</b> <b>methods</b> with FDR control on sample sizes with 2 – 3 replicates exhibits the same high sensitivity and specificity as a t -test with FDR control on sample sizes with 6 – 9 replicates in detecting at least two-fold change. Conclusions Our results suggest that the <b>two-way</b> ANOVA <b>methods</b> using probe-level data are substantially more powerful tests for detecting differential gene expression than corresponding methods for probe-set level data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{communication}} systems of today {{rely on the}} real time accessibility of accurate time and frequency measures {{and there is an}} increasing demand for the development of new and redundant methods for the distribution of these measures. The classical <b>two-way</b> <b>method</b> is able to compensate for the inevitable variations in the time and frequency propagation delay. The <b>two-way</b> <b>method</b> is used for time transfer in free space, electrical or optical domain, but has the disadvantage of often using two different paths for transmitting back and forward. The paths may be of equal length and have equal propagation delay, but nevertheless there is often a remaining asymmetry in the propagation paths. The inevitable asymmetry between the paths in the time transfer delay must be detected and compensated for, if an accuracy better than s-level is needed for transmission distance exceeding a few km. Furthermore, if the number of users is high, there will be a complex and large network of two-way time signal transmissions. Therefore, a solution using one-way broadcasting would be more desirable, and would be possible if the variations in transmission time could be estimated from the received data at the far (user) end. The one-way method uses only one path of transmission and is possible to implement in existing Wavelength Division Multiplexing-networks. Proof of concept and results of this one-way time transfer technique based on transmission of a repetitive signal, modulated on two lasers at different wavelengths 8 nm apart and transmitted through an optical fiber, has been presented previously. These data showed a strong correlation between a change in transfer time at one wavelength, and the transfer time difference for the signals at the two wavelengths. In this paper, the setup and the measurement results have been improved and new data is collected which shows improvement in the reliability and quality of this technique. The stability is improved through component analysis and minimizing error sources. The distance is improved from 38 km to 160 km...|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is a widely}} accepted design and analysis tool for building ventilation. This paper presents a simple method using commercial CFD software to obtain the solution multiplicity characteristics of laminar and turbulent indoor airflows. The method {{is known as the}} two-way continuation simulation, which has been developed for identifying multiple solutions in computational {{fluid dynamics}}. We consider airflows in a simple two-zone building with four openings, where one of the zones has a constant heat source, modeling the heat or pollutant generation and spread in buildings governed by natural stack forces. Using the new two-way continuation simulation method, we describe the flow variation and physical mechanisms at different heights in the two zones for different Rayleigh numbers. The results show that two steady solutions with the same boundary conditions and building geometry can be obtained step-by-step in the simulation process. Flow multiplicity can also be found as the height ratio of the two zones increases or decreases. As an important physical parameter, the Rayleigh number can also have some significant influences on the flow bifurcation or variation. Compared with conventional CFD simulation, the two-way continuation simulation method can effectively identify the possible existence of multiple solutions of indoor airflows and pollutant spread with different initial conditions.

30|$|Both the {{conventional}} Very Long Baseline Interferome-try (VLBI) technique and laser ranging have certain limitations {{in their ability}} for ground-based geodetic observation of the Moon, with an accuracy reaching up to a few centimeters. Regarding laser ranging technology, the observation period is limited as it cannot be used to observe the Moon during a full or new Moon. In comparison, the VLBI technique is associated with an error caused by the propagation media. The instrument cannot be corrected with high accuracy and, therefore, {{the accuracy of the}} delay is limited to almost 0.1 ns. Kawano et al. (1999) proposed that the tides and rotational variations of the Moon or planets could be observed with greater accuracy using a new method, called the “Inverse VLBI (iVLBI)”. This method enables geodetic measurement of the Moon with an error of a few millimeters, which is the same as that for observations from the Earth. Following further development of the concept and design of the iVLBI, as well as demonstration of its applications in science, the <b>two-way</b> <b>method</b> was recommended for synchronizing the reference frequency that was generated by the landing units (Kawano et al., 2009). A different direct ranging method was proposed to monitor the standard frequencies (Kawano et al., 2010). The iVLBI technology was also selected as a candidate research project in SELENE 2. We are aware that the time-transfer and ranging experiment between the ground and a satellite has been performed in the ETS-VIII experiment (Takahashi et al., 2008). Precise time-transfer is a reference technique applied in order to realize the iVLBI system. The phase difference between the signals of the two landing units is an essential parameter and needs to be measured as it directly influences the accuracy of the result. In this article, we propose a solution to the phase-difference measurement.|$|E

40|$|Backgrounds and Aims: Visual {{field testing}} {{is a common}} {{procedure}} used in clinical assessments to provide a functional measure of vision. It is usually conducted by measuring the detectability of a spot of light presented to discrete locations across the visual field (static perimetry) or by moving a spot of light across the visual field until it is visible (kinetic perimetry). Despite the popularity of visual field testing in both research and clinical assessment, a number of limitations have been noted with both methods. In particular, it has been noted that contrast sensitivity measured by automated visual field does not hold good concordance with structural loss (resulting from eye disease) and that static and kinetic perimetry yield different results, despite that they assess the hill of vision.  In this thesis, visual field testing was examined, {{and the effect of}} spatial summation (Chapter 3), and the relationship between static and kinetic perimetry (Chapter 4) were investigated in separate studies. Hypothesis This thesis is built upon the hypothesis that testing the retina with a stimulus smaller than critical area will provide a better sensitivity to central retinal defects. In addition, static and kinetic testing is highly correlated if the testing method of Kinetic testing is modified. Experiments In the first study, a review of previous studies examined how the stimulus size and spatial summation (the degree to which the visual system spatially integrates information to detect contrast) affected contrast sensitivity. Following this, spatial summation was measured empirically, and the critical area (Ac) at different retinal locations was quantified. The Ac, which is the point at which contrast threshold no longer improves as the stimulus size is increased, (derived from data in previous studies and empirically) was observed to increase with retinal eccentricity, and this was uniform across the visual field. In particular, a Goldmann size III (the gold standard target size) is larger than the Ac within the central 25 - 30 degrees of arc; this means that size III can be less sensitive to detect the threshold, but is more sensitive at higher eccentricities because it is less than the Ac. This explains why size III can capture glaucoma at the periphery at early stages of the disease. Accordingly, current visual field testing (static, 30 - 2 screening test), which uses a fixed-size stimulus for central and peripheral retina, does not test the visual field equally (as spatial summation is dependent on retinal eccentricity, and thus contrast sensitivity is dependent on stimulus size) and is influenced by the different spatial summation characteristic of different retinal locations. In study 2, kinetic perimetry was performed to identify isopters along different angular meridians, but in two conditions in which the target was moved {{from the center of the}} stimulus to the periphery or in the opposite conditions. This <b>two-way</b> <b>method</b> of limits corrected for the directional bias associated with testing in one direction. This experiment identified a specific region on the retina, where the contrast of the kinetic stimulus was the same as the contrast threshold measured using static perimetry; we called it isocontrast region. This finding suggests that static and kinetic perimetry are highly correlated and previous reports of outcome differences most likely stem from methodological differences. Conclusion The findings of the present study indicate that considerations of the test stimulus size and the method used to measure visual field are most important in visual field testing because they greatly contribute to the accuracy in measuring contrast sensitivity...|$|E
