5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor {{are located}} on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture.

5|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on May 27, 1910. <b>The</b> <b>surviving</b> fragment in the Library of Congress is 12 minutes 35 seconds long, {{but it does not}} include the final scene with the disguised Queen of Sicilia. <b>The</b> <b>surviving</b> fragment has suffered significant damage due to deterioration. The film was re-released by the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation with a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher.|$|E
5|$|The release {{managed to}} survive against {{considerable}} odds, but <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> print is not without severe faults. <b>The</b> <b>surviving</b> print has considerable nitrate deterioration and very poor picture quality in certain parts.

5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} {{during this phase}} of the evolution of the Universe.

5|$|At 02:30 {{a second}} wave of about 150 to 200 Japanese troops again {{attacked}} across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out.

25|$|The {{playoffs in}} each season format have {{consisted}} of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving home-field advantage. In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with <b>the</b> highest <b>surviving</b> seed hosting <b>the</b> lowest <b>surviving</b> seed and <b>the</b> second-highest <b>surviving</b> seed hosting <b>the</b> third <b>surviving</b> seed. <b>The</b> winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006–10) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011–), held at the home ground of <b>the</b> higher <b>surviving</b> seed.

5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, most of <b>the</b> <b>surviving</b> {{aircraft}} {{had been}} withdrawn from combat units.
