50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is over-grazing and {{trampling}} of shrub-lands and tussock grasslands by feral herbivores and domestic stock. Habitat clearing, fragmentation, landscape degradation, and fires which occur too frequently and extensively, are also threats to the stripe-faced dunnarts habitat. Predation by feral cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) also directly impacts the species population. Removal of fallen timber also threatens the species as it relies on it for shelter form the heat and predator, as well forages for invertebrates that may live in or under woody debris. The dunnarts are very sensitives to the organophosphorus pesticide fenitrothion which at sub-lethal intoxication can cause lethargy and <b>temporary</b> <b>immobilisation,</b> increasing the risk of predation. The pesticide is used by local landholders to control locusts.|$|E
30|$|The Station {{subsystem}} performs two functions—respectively interface and storage—firstly, {{for passengers}} and secondly, for vehicles. With regard to passengers, the interface function links a particular service line (route) {{to all the}} other transport services (another route or another mode), whilst the storage function concentrates travellers within vehicles or waiting areas prior to vehicle loading. As regards the vehicles, the interface function separates the upstream and downstream parts of the route, hinging around the unloading of alighting passengers and the loading of boarding passengers; the storage function pertains to the division of platforms and tracks within the station between vehicles {{on the basis of their}} real-time allocation (operational service or <b>temporary</b> <b>immobilisation).</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that immobilisation of the lower limb may prevent surface fibrillation and osteophyte formation, and reduce cell depletion, following injection of iodoacetate into the ipsilateral knee of the guinea-pig. The present study shows that <b>temporary</b> <b>immobilisation</b> also facilitates repair of the damaged cartilage during a subsequent period of remobilisation in which the animal is permitted to move 'on all fours'. Thus, in animals killed six weeks after a single intra-articular injection of iodoacetate (0. 3 mg in 0. 1 ml saline), and in which the injected knee had been immobilised for three weeks, Safranin-O staining of the articular cartilage was more intense, chondrocyte density greater, and osteophytosis much less marked than in animals injected with iodoacetate but killed immediately after the three weeks immobilisation period. By contrast, immobilisation for only one week failed to protect against degenerative changes and osteophytes caused by iodoacetate injection. Immobilisation alone produced no apparent pathological changes in animals which did not receive iodoacetate...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{fraction}} of a potting mix is subject to decomposition and, therefore, is important in relation to nitrogen (N) immobilisation. Immobilisation of N is the reduction in plant available N (i. e., nitrate or ammonium) as a result ofmicroorganisms using this N as they decompose organic materials with a high carbon (C) content. The organic portion of potting mixes usually constitutes 50 % {{or more of their}} volume and in New Zealand Pinus radiata bark and sphagnum peat are the most commonly used materials. Pinus radiata sawdust, tree fern fibre, composted mixed vegetation, and other sources of bark or sawdust are also used on a limited scale. Spent mushroom compost has also been successfully used in bark and peat container media overseas although there have been reports ofproblems with its use in New Zealand. It has good physical properties and is a useful source of nutrients except for N. Spent mushroom compost may cause <b>temporary</b> N <b>immobilisation,</b> after which N is slowly mineralised from it. Spent mushroom compost also has a highsoluble salt content that can be ameliorated by leaching, and a pH of 6. 5 - 8. 1. This paper seeks to review the factors causing decomposition of these organic materials and the implications of these processes on N immobilisation...|$|R
40|$|Kienböck's {{disease is}} a form of osteonecrosis {{affecting}} the lunate. Its aetiology remains unknown. Morphological variations, such as negative ulnar variance, high uncovering of the lunate, abnormal radial inclination and/or a trapezoidal shape of the lunate and the particular pattern of its vascularity may be predisposing factors. A history of trauma is common. The diagnosis is made on plain radiographs, but MRI can be helpful early in the disease. A CT scan is useful to demonstrate fracture or fragmentation of the lunate. Lichtman classified Kienböck disease into five stages. The natural history of the condition is not well known, and the symptoms do not correlate well with the changes in shape of the lunate and the degree of carpal collapse. There is no strong evidence to support any particular form of treatment. Many patients are improved by <b>temporary</b> <b>immobilisation</b> of the wrist, which does not stop the progression of carpal collapse. Radial shortening may be the treatment of choice in young symptomatic patients presenting with stages I to III-A of Kienböck's disease and negative ulnar variance. Many other forms of surgical treatment have been described. © 2008 British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Green-manure in Mediterranean stockless organic farms is {{a useful}} tool to improve {{nitrogen}} availability, reduce production cost and conserve soil fertility. A 2 -year on farm research {{was carried out in}} Tuscany (Italy) to evaluate the effect of 3 different green manures (Hordeum v. + Avena s. mixture, Trifolium s. + Avena s. mixture, Vicia faba var. minor) and 2 levels of organic N fertilization (0 and 120 Kg N ha- 1) on maize in 2004 and 2005. Green manures were ploughed into the soil in April 2004 and organic fertiliser was applied before sowing; neither green manure nor fertilizers were applied in 2005 to evaluate the residual effect of the treatments. The effect of the distribution of organic fertilizer was not efficient in comparison to green-manure. Field- bean increased maize productivity in both the years thanks to an increase in N availability as suggested by its total N uptake that exceeded the uptake of maize after control by 19. 5 and 14, 3 Kg N ha- 1 in the first and second year. In our experimental conditions, with low organic matter and nitrogen content in the soil, the use of grasses as green-manure caused <b>temporary</b> <b>immobilisation</b> of N and maize yield reduction...|$|E
