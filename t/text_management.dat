50|$|Information Extraction is {{the part}} of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising {{automatic}} methods for <b>text</b> <b>management,</b> beyond its transmission, storage and display. The discipline of information retrieval (IR) has developed automatic methods, typically of a statistical flavor, for indexing large document collections and classifying documents. Another complementary approach is that of natural language processing (NLP) which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task. In terms of both difficulty and emphasis, IE deals with tasks in between both IR and NLP. In terms of input, IE assumes the existence of a set of documents in which each document follows a template, i.e. describes one or more entities or events {{in a manner that is}} similar to those in other documents but differing in the details. An example, consider a group of newswire articles on Latin American terrorism with each article presumed to be based upon one or more terroristic acts. We also define for any given IE task a template, which is a(or a set of) case frame(s) to hold the information contained in a single document. For the terrorism example, a template would have slots corresponding to the perpetrator, victim, and weapon of the terroristic act, and the date on which the event happened. An IE system for this problem is required to “understand” an attack article only enough to find data corresponding to the slots in this template.|$|E

40|$|As {{educators}} {{become more}} interested in the use of qualitative methods, a major concern is the management of the large amounts of textual data during analysis. The efficiency and possibly the effectiveness of manual systems, i. e., color-coded index cards and wall mounted systems, are reduced as the amount of textual data increases. An emerging family of <b>text</b> <b>management</b> programs, such as ASKSAM (Access Stored Knowledge via Symbolic Access Method), r'ay help address this concern by automating aspects of the analysis and, thus, facilitating the process. A case study example that compared results achieved through the use of ASKSAM and through a file card analysis indicated that the data analyzed via the computerized approach yielded essentially the same result as had previously been obtained through the traditional analytic approach. These results suggest that the use of a computer-based <b>text</b> <b>management</b> program can increase the efficiency of the data analysis process without significantly altering the interpretations made from the data.

40|$|As {{the text}} {{information}} grows explosively in today’s multidimensional text databases, managing and mining {{this kind of}} databases is now playing an extremely important role in every domain. Different from traditional text mining tasks that target at single data sets, a <b>text</b> <b>management</b> system for a multidimensional database requires its text mining functions performed in different contexts specified by the structured dimensions, and the system should well support OLAP (online analytical processing) of the text information. This is a big challenge for most existing text mining techniques because of the efficiency and the scalability issues. On the other hand, the huge amount of text information in such databases also provides us an opportunity of acquiring new knowledge out of it, which could be super beneficial. In this thesis, I identified three major types of functions that a <b>text</b> <b>management</b> system should support in order to analyze multidimensional text databases: (1) effective and efficient digestion: the system should support users to digest the text information in an OLAP environment based on domain knowledge; (2) flexible exploration: the system should allow users to flexibly explore the text information based on ad hoc information needs; (3) discovery analysis: the system shoul...|$|E

This communication was used in concert and integrated with a more traditional learning and teaching context (lectures and a virtual learning environment). Drawing on evidence from two student surveys, focus groups and a tutor's journal, we illustrate how mobile SMS communication has influenced the student learning experience.

40|$|The {{widespread}} citation of <b>management</b> <b>texts</b> {{in academic}} journals implies {{that they are}} a significant influence on the diffusion and implementation of management concepts. This article applies a neo-institutional analysis to the use of two widely cited <b>management</b> <b>texts</b> in the diffusion of a management fashion: Reengineering Work (Harv. Bus. Rev. 68 (1990) 104) and Reengineering the Corporation (Reengineering the Corporation: a Manifesto for Business Revolution, HarperCollins, New York, 1993). It is seen that these texts do not prescribe a methodology for reengineering, but instead of being a weakness this "hollow core" creates a space for actors to reinterpret the concept while drawing on its symbolic force. The texts are kept in circulation by the need of academics to cite foundational texts and the symbolic value of foundational <b>texts</b> to legitimise <b>management</b> practices.
