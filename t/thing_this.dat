5|$|In December 1976, {{following}} World Record, Banton quit, {{quickly followed}} by Jackson in February 1977. Nic Potter returned to replace Banton, {{and in a}} typically eccentric move Jackson {{was replaced by a}} violinist, Graham Smith (formerly of Charisma folk-rock band String Driven <b>Thing).</b> <b>This</b> line-up produced the album The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome (September 1977). The band also shortened its name to Van der Graaf. Charles Dickie then joined the band on cello, documented on the live double-album Vital, which saw a brief reunion with Jackson. By the time Vital was released, in July 1978, the band had already split, because of lack of record company support in the United States and financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E

25|$|That is, up to isomorphism, {{abstract}} and concrete Boolean algebras {{are the same}} <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> quite nontrivial result depends on the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a choice principle slightly weaker than the axiom of choice, and is treated in more detail in the article Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras. This strong relationship implies a weaker result strengthening the observation in the previous subsection to the following easy consequence of representability.|$|E
25|$|The Huayan school {{taught the}} {{doctrine}} of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in Indra's net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> philosophy is based {{in the tradition of the}} great Madhyamaka scholar Nagarjuna and, more specifically, on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Regarded by D.T. Suzuki as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the Avatamsaka Sutra elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} {{discovered}} that, on microcoded implementations of certain architectures, complex operations {{tended to be}} slower than a sequence of simpler operations doing the same <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> was in part an effect {{of the fact that}} many designs were rushed, with little time to optimize or tune every instruction; only those used most often were optimized, and a sequence of those instructions could be faster than a less-tuned instruction performing an equivalent operation as that sequence. One infamous example was the VAX's INDEX instruction.|$|E
25|$|Viking burial rituals were {{complex and}} dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala {{describes}} the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted {{of days of}} mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces and putting them in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, {{it could not have}} solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.|$|E
25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use index marking rules to determine possible bindings. Index marking rules are rules used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a unique identifier of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, and so will refer to the same <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> indexing theory was used as a way {{to describe}} pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|E

25|$|The {{elements}} {{found in}} consciousness are {{also to be}} found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity.|$|E

Jason Scott of Blogcritics noted that, [...] "If [...] learned one <b>thing</b> <b>this</b> past year, it's how to be brutally and often painfully honest".

500|$|According to Tolkien, [...] "the inflections of [...] verbs {{are always}} pretty regular", and Quenya verbs are {{either in a}} {{personal}} form or an impersonal form.

[...] An impersonal verb form is a verb to which no pronoun has been attached, as carë (sg.) or carir (pl.); carin, [...] "I do (habitually)", is a personal form (with -n, a short suffix for [...] "I, me").

[...] With writer Vladimir Nabokov's works Pale Fire and Lolita being considered as the [...] "biggest external influence" [...] on Wildlife, the album features dark lyrical themes that focus on personal loss and the anger and despair felt from watching one's hometown decay, as well as dealing with personal loss, whether it is faith, a friend, or a family member.|$|E

The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real <b>thing.</b> <b>This</b> was such my pleasure."

[...] Roger Ebert gave the film a [...] "Thumbs down" [...] rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review, which he began with the following: [...] "Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a carnival geek show. We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity; if it proves nothing else, it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn't get the NC-17 rating for violence, nothing ever will." [...] Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39%, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 from 163 reviews.|$|E
