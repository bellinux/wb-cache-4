5|$|After his release, Friday {{returned}} to Acton, {{where he had}} a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. <b>The</b> <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> their four {{children}} were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer. In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items.

5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt <b>the</b> <b>couple,</b> <b>and</b> especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better.

5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011.

According to <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E

Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between <b>the</b> <b>couple,</b> <b>and</b> the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E

Michael VIII was infuriated with the cowardliness of <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> refused to grant them an audience for days. In Tarnovo, the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter, which had devastating effect on the rebels. Despite the military successes, neither was the Mongol threat dealt with, nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines. As a result, Ivaylo's followers, disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace, began to abandon his cause. With diminished support, in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates, including Kasim beg, to seek aid from Nogai Khan.|$|E
