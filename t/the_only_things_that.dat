25|$|Still incognito, the Commander {{traveled}} to Denver where he {{sought out the}} undercover Crimson Guard agent Fred VII, a mechanical genius. Billy eventually awoke from the coma, with acute amnesia (and a new motorized prosthetic leg built by Fred). After an encounter with the Blind Master and Storm Shadow's cousin Jinx, Billy recovered his memory and immediately rejected his father, whereupon the Commander renounced the organization he had founded, declaring that his ambitions had cost him <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> truly mattered. Fred VII, in return, shot Cobra Commander in the back, apparently killing him.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, minor {{actions were}} {{fought in the}} fortifications {{surrounding}} Bucharest between the invading Germans and the Romanian reserves which had failed to arrive and {{the remnants of the}} defenders of the Sereth–Putna line, yet it was occupied by the Germans on 6 December 1916, which was the same day that southern Romania capitulated, as the monarchy had fled to Iași. Heavy rain and terrible roads were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> saved the remainder of the Romanian Army, which began to withdraw towards the Siret River and Russia, where the campaign drew to a close in January 1917. Romanian losses during the battle on the Argeș and the fighting that preceded it were very high, with about 300,000 being lost, around 150,000 of which were captured. In this same period, the Germans had suffered about 60,000 casualties.|$|E

500|$|Fegelein's {{politically}} motivated marriage to Gretl Braun, Eva Braun's sister, {{took place on}} 3 June 1944 in Salzburg. Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun {{as a way to}} advance his career. Hitler, Himmler and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony. A two-day celebration was then held at Hitler's and Bormann's Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagle's Nest. Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs. Hitler's secretaries, Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge, state Fegelein was popular socially, particularly with women. He could be funny, amusing and charming. After his marriage to Gretl, Eva was glad to have someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt, as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection. Thereafter, Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann. Fegelein [...] "never missed" [...] Bormann's drinking parties and told Junge that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> mattered were [...] "his career and a life full of fun." ...|$|E

Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual).

2500|$|Like most people, pirates [...] "were {{creatures of}} incentives." [...] Piracy allowed a crew {{to benefit from}} [...] "every penny of its ship's ill-gotten booty." [...] One's share of the plunder was {{directly}} proportionate to a crewman's job aboard the ship, and was outlined in the ship's articles. If a pirate were to take more than his share, hide in times of war, or was dishonest with the crew, he [...] "risked being deposited" [...] somewhere unpleasant and full of hardships. Also, ships were not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were able to be plundered. A select group of pirates also attacked a Sierra Leone fort and several fortresses used for the slave trade.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{residential}} segregation split communities {{between the}} black inner city and white suburbs. This phenomenon {{is due to}} white flight where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There {{are more than just}} geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene was Skilling's {{favorite}} book {{and served as}} the foundation of his managerial philosophy. Skilling held, by his own interpretation, a Darwinian view of what makes the world work. He believed that money and fear were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> motivated people. He set up the performance review system (PRC) in which employees were graded from 1 to 5, 5 being lowest. Fifteen percent of people had to be graded five, regardless of absolute performance. Those were given two weeks to try to find another job at Enron or be fired. The scheme {{came to be known as}} [...] "rank and yank". Skilling said [...] "The PRC process is the most important process we conduct as a company". (This process is similar to the grading system in place at Harvard Business School while Skilling was a student there. In each class, instructors were required to grade 15% of the students with either of the two lowest grades available – [...] "Low Pass" [...] or [...] "Fail".) ...|$|E
2500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, access to Little Sark was extremely difficult or, at best, unnerving. La Coupée was traversed by a narrow dirt track, and children are reputed to have had to crawl across it on their hands and knees to prevent being blown over the edge by the wind. According to a description in 1875, [...] "People have thrown themselves flat on their face, from terror and nervousness on reaching the Coupée; others have lost courage half way across, and have hidden themselves behind the heads of the rocks that crop up in the middle of the Coupée until some passer by came and led them along; others have been unable to get across without shutting their eyes and being led between two persons." [...] On 4 September 1802, Elie Guille of the Clos-à-Jaon was carrying sheaves of corn across La Coupée for the payment of tithes. He was blown over the East side and killed. After that the Seigneurs farmed out the collection of tithes in Little Sark to an individual in Little Sark who could settle the dues in cash. There were for a long time arguments between the inhabitants and the Seigneur over whose responsibility it was to maintain the path across La Coupée. In 1811 a landslip reduced the width of the path to no more than 3 feet. Finally in 1812 an act of agreement was signed between the parties to ensure every male inhabitant subject to the ordinary repairs of the road would give two days' corvée to the La Coupée road and in return the Seigneur would guarantee to provide all remaining expenses. Following another landslip in 1862 on the Little Sark side a retaining wall was constructed so as to provide a foundation for a roadway 8–10 feet wide. However the narrowness of the path and the vertiginous drop were not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> made many wary of crossing La Coupée, especially at night, as the locality was reputed to be haunted. Strange moaning sounds or unearthly shrieks have been reported; however, these have been explained away as being due to the actions of wave and tide in La Caverne des Lamentes in the bay. The black dog called the Tchico was also reputed to haunt La Coupée as it ran the roads of Sark. Sibyl Hathaway, Dame of Sark, recorded that some of the Islanders believed that the reason why her donkey would not cross La Coupée was because of sensitivity to the presence of the Tchico.|$|E
