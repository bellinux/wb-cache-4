Inside the Aurilite temple, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>group</b> left Plateros at 22:30 to trek {{back towards}} American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners.

5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe.

This was unexpected as the stability of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> 12 selenides tends to decrease down <b>the</b> <b>group</b> from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down <b>the</b> <b>group</b> for <b>the</b> <b>group</b> 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E
