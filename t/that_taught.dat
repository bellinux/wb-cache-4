5|$|The Mexican {{interior}} ministry banned the film {{because of a}} series of burglaries mimicking its heist scene. Rififi was banned in Finland in the late 1950s. In answer to critics who saw the film as an educational process <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> people how to commit burglary, Dassin claimed the film showed how difficult it was to actually carry out a crime.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{introduction}} to surveying began {{at an early}} age through school exercises <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where the young Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.|$|E
5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{occupies}} {{a special place}} in the history of Indian radio. In 1935, Aakashvani, the first private radio station in India, was started by Prof. M.V. Gopalaswamy in Mysore. The popular radio station was taken over by the local municipality and later by All India Radio (AIR) and moved to Bangalore in 1955. Later in 1957, AIR adopted the original name of the radio station, Aakashavani as its own. Some of the popular programs aired by AIR Bangalore included Nisarga Sampada and Sasya Sanjeevini which were programs <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> science through songs, plays and stories. These two programs became so popular that they were translated and broadcast in 18 different languages and the entire series was recorded on cassettes by the Government of Karnataka and distributed to thousands of schools across the state. Karnataka has witnessed a growth in FM radio channels, mainly in the cities of Bangalore, Mangalore and Mysore, which has become hugely popular.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5000|$|This {{idea was}} {{promoted}} by Cyprian in the 3rd century, before the Edict of Milan, when most Christians were persecuted and lived outside of society. Augustine of Hippo also discussed this topic in City of God, noting <b>that</b> some <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> the entire Catholic Church would be saved. At <b>that</b> time many <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> 1 Corinthians 12:12-14 which describes Christians as [...] "one body" [...] implied collective salvation. Augustine rejected the concept, maintaining {{that people who}} live immoral lives can never be saved, even if they partake of the Eucharist.|$|R

25|$|Women in {{polygamous}} relationships at {{the time}} described the experience as a great trial <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> them self-denial. Many were protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, {{it was not always}} accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process that brought them closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> her subordination to God and her family.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there are}} a number of schools <b>that</b> <b>taught</b> {{painting}} during India's history, there is great similarity among them to evoke charming, romantic scenes. The scenes may include moonlight or lanterns to set an amorous mood. Such was the case for 19th century artist, Chokha, who enjoyed making night paintings like Escapade at Night: A Nobleman Climbs a Rope to Visit his Lover. In that painting Chokha captures the tension of lover climbing several stories into a house with many people and a sleeping guard. Chokha also liked to capture twilight hunting scenes. He astutely conveyed the effects of lighting variation between twilight and the darkest night.|$|E
