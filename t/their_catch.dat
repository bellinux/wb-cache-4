5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{occasionally}} departed Bristol for Iceland {{as early}} as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke <b>their</b> <b>catch)</b> from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities. In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.|$|E

50|$|This bird {{will feed}} on rodents, small birds and insects. It also robs {{gulls and terns}} of <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b>|$|R
50|$|They were avid {{fisherman}} {{and members}} of the Santa Catalina Island Tuna Club. Both held records for <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Whitetip reef {{sharks are}} rarely {{aggressive}} towards humans, {{though they may}} investigate swimmers closely. However, spear fishers {{are at risk of}} being bitten by one attempting to steal <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b> This species is caught for food, though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported. The IUCN has assessed the whitetip reef shark as Near Threatened, noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of unregulated fishing activity across its range. The slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of <b>their</b> <b>catch,</b> using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> which it then snatches up.|$|E
25|$|The Nootka, Makah, Quilleute and Auinault {{tribes of}} Vancouver Island and {{the coast of}} Washington were also skilled whalers of the gray and {{humpback}} whales. Right whales were rare in <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Port Clinton Community and Sports Club {{was formed}} {{by a group of}} local men whose wives were tired of them cooking <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> of Blue Swimmer Crabs in the {{household}} kitchen.|$|R

25|$|In the Shetland Isles, Scotland, {{fishermen}} {{believed that}} as soon as a sea eagle appeared fish would rise to the surface, belly up; this led to some fishermen using eagle fat, smeared on their bait, to increase <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no legally adopted term in Russia for artisanal fisheries. Artisanal or {{subsistence}} fishing usually refers to fishing mainly with traditional gear, with production {{delivered to the}} market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as salmon, chars, whitefish, navaga, flounders and greenling fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. Subsistence fishing by indigenous groups is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for anadromous fish). Legally, they are bound to use <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> for local consumption only. They {{are not allowed to}} sell <b>their</b> <b>catch,</b> but in reality, this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|Hellyer {{trawlers}} {{stayed out}} at sea {{for weeks at a}} time, transferring <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> to a fleet of five fast steam cutters that commuted between the fishing grounds and the fish markets of eastern England. Viola was regularly at sea for more than 310 days a year.|$|E
50|$|It was Turks and Caicos salt that George Washington {{needed to}} {{preserve}} the food for his army during the American Revolutionary War and that the Canadian and American fishing fleets used to salt down <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{framework}} of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> would be quantified.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} the spill, the {{ecosystem}} began to recover, {{but it was still}} far from its initial state; the fishermen of Hungary claimed that <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> in 2002 were only at a fifth of their original levels.|$|R
25|$|In Vietnam, elegant coracles {{constructed}} with bamboo, are still used from many beaches, {{such as at}} Nha Trang, Phan Thiáº¿t and Mui Ne. The coracles are towed in a line behind a motor boat, like beads on a string, to their fishing ground. There the fisherman lay fishing nets in the sea before another tow returns them with <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leavitt {{arrived in}} the Canadian Arctic {{in the late nineteenth}} century as the New England and San Francisco-based whaling fleet pursued their targets into the frozen {{northern}} seas. The oil-bearing bones in the heads of bowhead whales were highly sought-after and brought large profits to the whalers. Captains of the whaling ships (first sail, and later steam-powered) would leave San Francisco in early summer, then whale in the Beaufort Sea for as long as the season would allow (generally eight or ten weeks) before new ice set in in September. Then they would go into winter quarters at Herschel Island, Alaska. By early the next summer, as soon as the ice broke, the whaling vessels would depart the Herschel with <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> from the previous year, which they would transport to San Francisco via the Bering Strait. In San Francisco, the vessels would sell <b>their</b> <b>catch,</b> refit their vessels, then depart again for the north, where they would repeat the exercise all over again.|$|E
25|$|The shore {{areas of}} Newfoundland were {{increasingly}} frequented by French fishermen for drying <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b> Although the British had intended that the French not erect any permanent structures or live on Newfoundland, {{the terms of}} the treaty were ambiguous. French settlements sprung up on the northern coast of Newfoundland, which {{came to be known as}} the French Shore, as well on the southern and western coasts.|$|E
50|$|They are omnivores {{like most}} Larus gulls, {{and they will}} {{scavenge}} on rubbish tips and elsewhere, as well as seeking suitable prey in fields or on the coast, or robbing smaller gulls and other seabirds of <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Medium {{to large}} seabirds with mainly grey or brown plumage, sharp claws and a hooked tip to the bill. They chase other seabirds {{to force them}} to drop <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b> There are about seven species worldwide, with four {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|R
50|$|During winter, {{thousands}} of migratory birds flock in to island. The fishermen use the airy and sunny land {{as an ideal}} place for drying <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> from the sea. Sometimes many of them also construct straw huts on the island as seasonal residences.|$|R
25|$|U.S. {{fisheries}} use most {{fishing gear}} types. Vessels are often configured {{so they can}} change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as lobster pots to bottom trawls to scallop dredges. The main techniques are purse seining and trawling. Some vessels freeze <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> at sea, such as factory trawlers, tuna boats, Alaskan crab pot vessels, and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land their catches near their homeports.|$|E
25|$|Swordfish {{charge at}} high speeds through forage fish schools, {{slashing}} with their swords to kill or stun prey. They then turn and return to consume <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b> Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes. Spinner sharks charge vertically through schools, spinning on their axis with their mouths open and snapping all around. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiralling runs often carries it into the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} crab-fishing months occur between October and January. The {{allocated}} {{time for a}} season continued to shrink â at one point a red crab season was only four days long. After 2005, each boat was given a quota based on <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> from previous years and how many crabs are available to catch. The fleet went from 251 boats down to 89. Currently the seasons last from two to four weeks.|$|E
50|$|Often tunny were to {{be found}} near {{commercial}} herring drifters tracking the migrating shoals of herring along the coast, or near steam trawlers hauling <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b> Actual angling was done from a small boat, sometimes a coble towed to the fishing grounds behind a large yacht.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Japan {{expressed}} [...] "grave concerns" [...] that Australian catch {{numbers were}} falsely counted. In response, Australia committed to implementing video monitoring to verify <b>their</b> <b>catches.</b> However, in 2013 Australia withdrew its commitment stating that such monitoring would impose an [...] "excessive regulatory and financial burden".|$|R
50|$|Fishing was an {{important}} business in Sark and permission was given to fish within 3 mi and for two boats to travel to Guernsey to sell <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> and bring back petrol for the boats. Once a week the boats would call into Herm and Jethou to deliver supplies.|$|R
25|$|The {{capture of}} {{undesirable}} species is a recognized problem with all fishing methods and unites environmentalists, {{who do not}} want to see fish killed needlessly, and fishermen, {{who do not want}} to waste their time sorting marketable fish from <b>their</b> <b>catch.</b> A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. Bycatch reduction grids or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others.|$|E
25|$|Despite the growth, {{the area}} was still {{isolated}} and access was restricted to a wagon on the bush track from Gosford or by a ferry from Wyong. The area was popular among fishermen and prior to 1908 the majority of boats that travelled to The Entrance used Tuggerah Jetty, the remains of which, still exists {{on the shore of}} Tuggerah Lake between the entrances to Wyong River and Ourimbah Creek. When Wyong River was dredged in 1908, the boats would take <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> into Wyong.|$|E
25|$|Heertje Jansz, {{master of}} the Hope, of Enkhuizen, wrote a day-by-day account of the season. The ships took two weeks to reach Jan Mayen, {{arriving}} early in June. On 15 June they met the two English ships, which Schrobop allowed to remain, on condition they gave half <b>their</b> <b>catch</b> to the Dutch. The ships from Dunkirk were given the same conditions. By late July the first ship had left with a full cargo of whale oil; the rest left early in August, several filled with oil.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{fishermen}} that operated from the fishing village of Xlendi lived in Fontana. Also, {{some other people}} used to go hunting in the adjacent Lunzjata Valley. Later in the nineteenth century, they began setting aside part of the proceeds from <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> to construct a church.|$|R
50|$|Migratory Birds in Nijhum Dwip: During winter, {{thousands}} of migratory birds flock in to island. The fishermen use the airy and sunny land {{as an ideal}} place for drying <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> from the sea. Sometimes many of them also construct straw huts on the island as seasonal residences.|$|R
5000|$|Fishery: Local {{fisherman}} {{were forced}} to sell to the military <b>their</b> <b>catches</b> at prices far below market rates. The military would in turn sell the fishes to local businesses {{at a much higher}} prices. Personnel of the Indonesian Navy might also waylay fishing vessels to extort payments from fishermen.|$|R
