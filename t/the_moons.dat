50|$|Around <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (Autour de la Lune, 1870), Jules Verne's {{sequel to}} From the Earth to <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> {{is a science}} fiction novel which {{continues}} the trip to <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> which was only partially described in the previous novel. It was later combined with From the Earth to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> to create A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and Around It. From the Earth to <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and Around <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> served as <b>the</b> basis for the film A Trip to <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|R

5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} {{enough that they}} could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. <b>The</b> <b>moons</b> that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{initially}} {{named his}} discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius.

5|$|Oberon {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula: a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Oberon and other Uranian moons compared to <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.

5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons {{to confine}} the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out.

5000|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, if {{the left}} side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is dark then the light part is growing, and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is {{referred}} to as [...] (moving toward a full <b>moon).</b> If <b>the</b> right side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is dark then the light part is shrinking, and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is referred to as waning (past full and moving toward a new <b>moon).</b> Assuming that <b>the</b> viewer is in the northern hemisphere, the right portion of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is <b>the</b> part that is always growing (i.e., if the right side is dark, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is growing darker; if the right side is lit, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is growing lighter).|$|R
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has {{adequate}} {{angular resolution}} {{to separate the}} light from <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> from that of Haumea.

5|$|The Inuit group {{includes}} five prograde outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distances from the planet (186–297 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclinations (45–50°) and their colors {{that they can be}} considered a group. <b>The</b> <b>moons</b> are Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq. The largest among them is Siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are {{devoid of}} known moons {{due to the}} Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause <b>the</b> <b>moons</b> to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites or ejection.

5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons {{are thought}} to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit.

5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus {{are thought to}} be {{relatively}} young, and not more than 600million years old.
