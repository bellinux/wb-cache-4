5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar can be used <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors.

The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|Fabian was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} to hit Bermuda since Hurricane Arlene in 1963. It was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. The hurricane's powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered Bermuda petrel, {{better known as the}} cahow, was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and also caused four people <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> along the United States' Atlantic coast. In all, Fabian caused around US in damage and eight deaths.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E

40|$|The theoretic {{part of the}} baccalaureate {{thesis is}} focused on {{providing}} first aid <b>to</b> <b>drowning</b> persons, on providing proper cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and {{on the possibility of}} using rescue and protective aids. This part explains principal causes of drowning, warns about places where drowning occurs most often, and indicates ways of prevention and safety. The purpose of the research part of the thesis was to determine whether the lay public has any theoretic knowledge of providing first aid <b>to</b> <b>drowning</b> persons. A quantitative method was used in the research part for data collection. The data was obtained using questionnaires, which were distributed to the lay public in the Uherské Hradiště region. The questionnaire was anonymous and included 14 questions. There was only one correct answer to every question. The questions were used to determine theoretic knowledge of first aid provision <b>to</b> <b>drowning</b> persons and theoretic knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The hypothesis presumed that the lay public had theoretic knowledge in providing first aid <b>to</b> <b>drowning</b> persons. However, the opposite followed from the defined criterion used to prove or disprove the hypothesis and from the quantitative investigation results, i. e. that the lay public did not have theoretic knowledge in providing first aid <b>to</b> <b>drowning</b> persons. Thus the hypothesis was disproved based on the research. The lay public showed insufficient knowledge particularly of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures. The research concluded that the lay public should be more interested in the procedures and novelties in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, {{as well as in the}} basics of first aid. Also, acquaintance with first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be more and better available to the lay public. A solution could be offered by compulsory first aid courses for all professions, provided by employers on a yearly basis at least...|$|R

He almost met his end before he had started; he was apprehended by the local communists in Mỹ Tho, who saw his French-style dress and mistook him for a colonial agent. They tied him up and chained him to a block of stone before throwing him into a river <b>to</b> <b>drown.</b> However, Thảo broke free of the weight and swam to safety.

She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused a man <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> after losing his footing {{along the beach}} near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E
