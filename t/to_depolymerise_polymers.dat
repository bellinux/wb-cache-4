Alginate is a linear, un-branched polysaccharide of (1 - 4) -linked -D-mannuronate (M) and its C- 5 epimer, -L-guluronate acid (G). These uronic acids {{are arranged}} in three different block types in the alginate polymer; poly-M, poly-G or poly-MG. Alginate lyases are enzymes that utilize a -elimination reaction <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> the alginate <b>polymer</b> resulting in cleavage of the (1 - 4) -O-glycosidic linkage between monomers {{and the formation of}} an unsaturated uronic acid at the new non-reducing terminus. Alginate lyases have been isolated {{from a wide range of}} sources including marine invertebrates and marine bacteria, which often produce more than one alginate lyase enzyme. Haliotis midae is the commercially important abalone species found along the South African coast. Over-fishing and poaching of this species has led to a depletion of the naturally occurring populations and closure of the recreational and commercial fisheries. Abalone farming was initiated and has rapidly increased in response to the increasing demand for this delicacy. However, there are many problems associated with abalone aquaculture, the most significant being disease and the slow growth rates of the animals. The use of probiotics in abalone aquaculture is a potential solution to both of these problems...|$|R
40|$|Lignin, {{the second}} most {{abundant}} polymer in nature, has a significant {{role to play in}} the move from petrochemical refinery to biorefinery. However, before that can occur an economically and environmentally sustainable method must be found <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> the recalcitrant <b>polymer</b> into useful monomers. Using steam exploded, hydrolysis lignin from sugar cane bagasse this project investigated the size changes seen in lignin in response to specific variables. Variables investigated are pH, time of UV light exposure, titanium dioxide photocatalyst type (P 25, PF 2 and Cyc 1) and concentration, as well as iron, manganese and hydrogen peroxide concentration. A high through-put, experimental design approach was developed in conjunction with a new aqueous (1 : 1 H 2 O:methanol) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) method using a short format (10 i. d. x 100 mm), methacrylate column (PL Rapide ™ Aqua L). High salt (0. 2 mol/L NaCl and 0. 2 mol/L KSCN, pH 7. 3) was used to minimise non-size based separation mechanisms, such as, hydrophobic and stationary phase interactions and aggregation of lignin. The resultant data was subjected to multiple regression analysis and models were constructed to quantitate the effect of each variable studied. Creating models represents a user friendly way of interpreting large amounts of data and can be used whether a traditional matrix or experimental design approach has been taken. Lignin depolymerisation chemistry is particularly suited to this approach as large data sets often result which are difficult to interpret. This work is the first known attempt to model size changes in lignin. Six models were constructed for each of four systems: a no-catalyst system and three containing titanium dioxide catalysts- P 25 (Degussa), PF 2 (Degussa) and Cyc 1 (Chengyin). Each of the six models applies to a different molecular weight range. The interaction between iron and hydrogen was found to be synergistic for PF 2 and the interaction between catalyst concentration and iron was found to be antagonistic for Cyc 1. For comparison between models the relative success of each model is expresse...|$|R
40|$|In nature, biofilms are {{the most}} common {{lifestyle}} of bacteria and are difficult to eradicate, partially due to the extracellular polymeric substances content of the slime in which biofilms are embedded, which act as a primary defence against disinfection. (Bacterio) phages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria and can represent an important strategy for biofilm control. These viruses have evolved specialized enzymes, called <b>depolymerises,</b> <b>to</b> degrade <b>polymers</b> present in the bacterial surface and slime (e. g. capsular and structural polysaccharides) to facilitate access to their hosts. We performed an in silico analysis of all available phage genomes infecting different bacteria and found 160 putative depolymerises with specialized activity (e. g. hyaluronidases, alginate and pectate lyases). This illustrates how well phages are equipped to degrade a diverse range of biofilm-associated polymers. We cloned and recombinantly expressed an Acinetobacter phage depolymerise and demonstrated its activity by the spot-on-lawn method. To further characterize the enzyme activity, the bacterial host genome was sequenced and a cluster (24. 6 kb) of genes responsible for the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis was identified. Using DNA recombination, mutations in either of the two transcribing strands were introduced to generate capsular polysaccharides deficient mutants. Results demonstrate that the depolymerise specifically degrades Acinetobacter capsular polysaccharides. Overall, in silico and experimental results suggest that phage represent a source of enzymes to degrade polymeric substances presence in bacterial slime, which can be further exploited for biofilm control...|$|R

The utility of the resulting bio-oils was therefore assessed by blending with a range of fuels. Guaiacol, a potential antioxidant, was formed over short reaction times and was found to be completely miscible with low-sulphur petrol (ULSP), diesel, aviation kerosene and rapeseed methyl ester.

The results of screening depolymerisation reactions in DMF and [emim][ABS] showed {{that all the}} copper–amine complexes catalysed lignin depolymerisation more efficiently in ionic liquids than in DMF. Among the seven types of ligands, copper complexes with two types of ligands (E) -N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline and (E) - 4 -methoxy-N-(pyridin- 2 -ylmethylene) aniline depolymerised the lignin more efficiently than the others. These two copper complexes with the N-based ligand were further studied to determine the most efficient conditions for the depolymerisation of the lignin. The most effective depolymerisation by conditions involved treatment at 180 °C for 12 h in [emim][ABS].

Current models suggest that poleward-moving kinetochores are attached <b>to</b> <b>depolymerising</b> K-fibres and anti-poleward-moving kinetochores to polymerising K-fibres. How the dynamics of individual microtubules within the K-fibre relate to poleward and anti-poleward movements is poorly understood. To investigate this, we developed a live-cell imaging assay combined with computational image analysis that allows eGFP-tagged EB 3 (also known as MAPRE 3) to be quantified at thousands of individual metaphase kinetochores as they undergo poleward and anti-poleward motion. Surprisingly, we found that K-fibres are incoherent, containing both polymerising and depolymerising microtubules – with a small polymerisation bias for anti-poleward-moving kinetochores. K-fibres also display bursts of EB 3 intensity, predominantly on anti-poleward-moving kinetochores, equivalent to more coherent polymerisation, and this was associated with more regular oscillations. The frequency of bursts and the polymerisation bias decreased upon loss of kinesin- 13, whereas loss of kinesin- 8 elevated polymerisation bias. Thus, kinetochores actively set the balance of microtubule polymerisation dynamics in the K-fibre while remaining largely robust to fluctuations in microtubule polymerisation...|$|R

However, so far the detailed molecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing microtubule tip remain elusive. Here we show that two distinct scenarios for the interactions of kinesin- 8 with the microtubule tip lead to qualitatively different microtubule dynamics including accurate length control as well as intermittent dynamics. We give a comprehensive analysis of the regimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary length depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the various proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective of whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length regulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates, and, in particular, limited to small polymerisation rates.

In order to get a better understanding of these effects, a range of enzymes with different in vitro modes of action were tested against cell wall analogues (bio-composite materials based on Acetobacter xylinus cellulose and xyloglucan). Tomato pericarp xyloglucan endo transglycosylase (tXET) and nasturtium seed xyloglucanase (nXGase) were produced heterologously in Pichia pastoris. Their action against the cell wall analogues was compared with that of a commercial preparation of Trichoderma endo-glucanase (EndoGase). Both 2 ̆ 7 hydrolytic 2 ̆ 7 enzymes (nXGase and EndoGase) were able <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> not only the cross-link xyloglucan fraction but also the surface-bound fraction. Consequent major changes in cellulose fibril architecture were observed. In mechanical terms, removal of xyloglucan cross-links from composites resulted in increased stiffness (at high strain) and decreased visco-elasticity with similar extensibility. On the other hand, true transglycosylase activity (tXET) did not affect the cellulose/xyloglucan ratio. No change in composite stiffness or extensibility resulted, but a significant increase in creep behaviour was observed in the presence of active tXET. These results provide direct in vitro evidence for the involvement of cell wall xyloglucan-specific enzymes in mechanical changes underlying plant cell wall re-modelling and growth processes.

Glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) glycocalyx covers the luminal aspect of the glomerular capillary wall and makes an important contribution to the glomerular barrier. ROS are known <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteoglycans, which are crucial for the barrier function of GEnC glycocalyx. The aim of this study is to investigate the direct effects of ROS on the structure and function of GEnC glycocalyx using conditionally immortalised human GEnC. ROS were generated by exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Biosynthesis and cleavage of GAG chains was analyzed by radiolabelling (S 35 and 3 H-glucosamine). GAG chains were quantified on GEnC surface and in the cell supernatant using liquid chromatography and immunofluorescence techniques. Barrier properties were estimated by measuring trans-endothelial passage of albumin. ROS caused a significant loss of WGA lectin and heparan sulphate staining from the surface of GEnC. This lead to an increase in trans-endothelial albumin passage. The latter could be inhibited by catalase and superoxide dismutase. The effect of ROS on GEnC was not mediated via the GAG biosynthetic pathway. Quantification of radiolabelled GAG fractions in the supernatant confirmed that ROS directly caused shedding of HS GAG.

The polymer characteristics of modified celluloses are to a high degree determined by the substituent distribution along the polymeric backbone.

Both these factors induce variation in substitution pattern and thus in the polymer behaviour. The available analytical techniques based on acid depolymerisation, are not sufficient to explain the variation in behaviour, thus an approach using selective cellulose degrading enzymes is attractive. Due to the enzymes different selectivity they will give rise to specific degradation pattern, which will reflect both the enzymes capability to cope with substituents and the polymer characteristics, i. e. how evenly the substituents are distributed.

Therefore, in humans, kinesin motor proteins {{have been identified as}} anti-cancer drug targets and small molecule inhibitors are now tested in clinical studies. Phylogenetic analyses have assigned five of the approximately fifty kinesin motor proteins coded by Trypanosoma brucei genome to the Kinesin- 13 family. Kinesins of this family have unusual biochemical properties because they do not transport cargo along microtubules but are able <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> microtubules at their ends, therefore contributing to the regulation of microtubule length. In other eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date, only between one and three Kinesin- 13 s are present. We have used immunolocalisation, RNAi-mediated protein depletion, biochemical in vitro assays and a mouse model of infection to study the single mitotic Kinesin- 13 in T. brucei. Subcellular localisation of all five T. brucei Kinesin- 13 s revealed distinct distributions, indicating that the expansion of this kinesin family in kinetoplastids is accompanied by functional diversification. Only a single kinesin (TbKif 13 - 1) has a nuclear localisation. Using active, recombinant TbKif 13 - 1 in in vitro assays we experimentally confirm the depolymerising properties of this kinesin. We analyse the biological function of TbKif 13 - 1 by RNAi-mediated protein depletion and show its central role in regulating spindle assembly during mitosis. Absence of the protein leads to abnormally long and bent mitotic spindles, causing chromosome mis-segregation and cell death.

In order to perform lignin degradation, enzymatic treatment could represent an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical methods. The main purpose of this PhD project was to develop an "enzymatic tool-box" for an efficient oxidation and degradation of lignin into aromatic monomers. Biochemical properties of available commercial and recombinant ligninolytic enzymes (laccase, Mn peroxidase and lignin peroxidase) were evaluated under identical experimental conditions, with the final goal to identify interesting biocatalysts for lignin degradation. The effect of pH, temperature, NaCl, DMSO and Tween- 80 on the enzymatic activity has been investigated. The activity of novel enzymes, such as the membrane-bound polyphenol oxidase from the marine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranea (MmPPOA) and a peroxidase produced by Nonomuraea gerenzanensis, was also evaluated. A new high-throughput colorimetric screening to assay the oxidation/degradation of lignin by different enzymes was developed: this method facilitates the identification of optimal conditions for a lignin treatment based on the combined use of various laccases and peroxidases.

A 5  wt% Ni supported on a MgAl hydrotalcite (a solid base catalyst employed widely for lipid transesterification to biodiesel [68, 69, 70]) was shown <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> a lignin model compound, 2 -phenoxy- 1 -phenethanol, and ball-milled lignin extracted from corn stover, into low molecular weight alkyl aromatics; interestingly, nickel nanoparticles present on the (likely external) hydrotalcite surface required no activation with H 2 prior to their catalytic application, suggesting that the active species was a mixed valence nickel oxide. Catalytic properties of nickel hydrotalcites are strongly influenced by the nature of interlayer anion. The presence of NO 3 − anions, or other basic anions, such as OH− and CO 3 2 −, in the interlayers conferred up to a three-fold activity enhancement in the depolymerisation of the model lignin compound 2 -phenoxy- 1 -phenethanol [71], wherein acetophenone (and phenol) were the principal products. Although the origin of this base promotion remains unclear, the depolymerisation mechanism may involve direct nitration of the phenolic. The same nitrate intercalated Ni hydrotalcite also proved effective for the depolymerization of enzymatically hydrolyzed lignin from corn stover, resulting in a large proportion of low molecular weight products, predominantly phenol, guaiacol, and syringol monomers, when performed in water, as compared with 4 -vinylphenol when conducted in 3 -methyl- 3 -pentanol at temperatures < 200  °C.|$|R

Still carboxylated styrene butadiene is the leading synthetic latex polymer used in EU- 27 for carpet backing, followed by styrene-acrylics and pure acrylics. This contrasts with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Turkey where styrene-acrylics dominate, followed by PVAc and redispersible powders [3]. In addition there has been a lot of research into developing alternative backing systems where the backing can easily be removed.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{following}} the inclusion of alginate high in mannuronic acid there is {{a reduction in the}} viscosity of soya melt during extrusion, this work attempts to identify the mechanism for this effect. The effect of water content and hydrocolloid inclusion on the denaturation behaviour and water binding properties of soya protein has been investigated, mainly by the use of differential scanning calorimetry. Of a range of parameters investigated, transition onset temperature and enthalpy, change in specific heat function and coopertivity of the transition all show a dependence on initial moisture content. These parameters are all changed if soya is heated {{in the presence of a}} high mannuronic acid alginate. With the exception of changes in enthalpy these effects are not seen to the same extent with other added hydrocolloids. These changes have been attributed to the production of water during heating. Measurements of freezable water and sorption isotherms suggest that alginate addition increases the water binding ability of soya isolate after denaturation. When heated at high temperatures only soya and gluten (out of 7 proteins tested) produced measurable quantities of additional water. In the presence of 2 % Manucol DM the formation of water was markedly increased in the soya and gluten samples but not in the other proteins. Production of increased amounts of water after alginate addition was demonstrated to be dependent on the quantity of mannuronic acid in the alginate. The dependence of this effect on water activity suggests that it is the result of browning or condensation reactions. Glutamic acid was implicated with the specific reaction between soya and alginate, though in heated soya both loss of lysine and serine were found. Differential rates of degradation were found between a high mannuronic acid alginate and a high guluronic acid alginate after heat treatment. The alginate high in mannuronic acid was shown <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> <b>to</b> a far greater extent. Various estimates for the molecular weight of the heat treated samples were obtained and no correlation could be found between increased reducing capability of the sample and extent of depolymerisation. Furthermore the production of volatiles that may be expected from sugar ring degradation were not found. Increased brown colour formation and water production and concomittant decreased glutamic acid content were found in soya samples extruded in the presence of 1 % Manucol DM.

METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either placebo or rhDNase 2. 5 mg twice daily for 10 days. Sputum samples were collected in sterile containers during screening and during treatment with the study drug. Pulmonary function and rheological analysis were the primary outcomes evaluated. Other parameters assessed were quantitative sputum bacteriology, sputum DNA concentration, and change in molecular mass of DNA polymers. RESULTS: The viscoelasticity of the sputum in untreated patients with cystic fibrosis was high and treatment with rhDNase reduced all the rheological parameters measured: dynamic storage modulus (a measure of elasticity), dynamic loss modulus (a measure of viscosity), and log complex modulus (a measure of mucus rigidity). The calculated cough clearance index was also improved following treatment with rhDNase. These rheological parameters showed a correlation with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) which was improved by a mean (SE) of 13. 3 (5. 6) % on day 10 of treatment with rhDNase compared with a change of 0. 2 (3. 1) % in the placebo group. There was no change in bacterial colony counts or sputum DNA concentrations following treatment with rhDNase, but a small decrease in high molecular weight DNA was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystic fibrosis treated with rhDNase show an improvement in rheological properties and pulmonary function, one of the mechanisms being a reduction in the proportion of high molecular weight DNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} new biosynthetic and {{biodegradable}} materials to save nonrenewable resources and reduce global pollution problems is an urgent task. Recently, materials like thermoplastic poly- 3 -hydroxyalkanoates (PHA), have been found synthesized by bacteria as storage materials. The major PHAs synthesized are poly-b-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), poly-b-hydroxyvalerate (PHV) and their copolymers. They are already commercially produced and used as BIOPOLTM (ICI, England). Their complete degradability by bacteria has already been shown. Today, oceans and estuaries serve as major landfills, and since fungi {{are an important part}} of the degrading microbiota, in order to prove their participation in the degradation process, a simple degradation test suitable for fungi and marine conditions had to be developed. Several solid media based on artificial sea water, differing in the content of non-alkanoate organics and supplemented with 0. 1 % PHA (or BIOPOLTM) as a main source of carbon have been tested. The testing principle consists of clearing the turbid medium in test tube or plates caused by suspended granules of PHA. All media tested supported the growth of fungi. For the discrete and transparent clearing of zones, a mineral medium with 0. 01 % peptone, 0. 01 % yeast extract, and 0. 1 % PHB or BIOPOLTM was finally chosen where the fine and evenly distributed turbidity is accomplished by a specific procedure. This method allows the investigation of degradability of PHA-based plastic materials as well as screening for fungal ability <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> pure PHA homopolymers. Using this medium, 32 strains of marine yeasts and 102 strains of marine mycelial fungi belonging to different systematic and ecological groups were tested for their ability to degrade PHAs. Only about 4 % of the strains were able to degrade BIOPOLTM and about 6 % depolymerised pure PHB homopolymer. This is in sharp contrast to the results of our previous experiments with 143 strains of terrestrial fungi which showed that 55 % are able to degrade BIOPOLTM...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} to the University of Bristol in partial fulfilment {{of the degree of}} Master of Science in Meat Science by Advanced Study and Research - Institute of Food Research, Bristol laboratory (Langford) Polyphosphates in small concentrations allow the use of lower concentrations of salt in the manufacture of meat products reducing their salty taste and the health risk from over-consumption of sodium. In their presence a better bind is achieved and the water present in the raw meat or takin up during processing is retained more completely after cooking. The aim of this thesis was to study the molecular mechanism by which polyphosphates funtion. Rabbit myofibrils and mince were used to investigate the effect of pyrophosphate on swelling and protein extraction in a range of NaCl concentrations from 0. 1 - 1. 0 M at pH 6. 0. 1 mM pyrophosphate had little effect on thee swelling of myofibrils in 0. 1 to 0. 4 M NaCl but, at higher NaCl concentrations it caused a marked inhibition of swelling. In the presence of 10 mM pyrophosphate swelling was higher than in NaCl alone in 0. 3 and 0. 4 M NaCl, but again at higher NaCl concentrations pyrophosphate caused a marked inhibition of swelling. Protein extration was higher at NaCl concentrations above 0. 2 M in the presence of 10 mM pyrophosphate. Phase-contrast light micrographs showed pyrophosphate to extract the A-band as the NaCl concentration rose to 0. 3 M NaCl and above, and in NaCl alone concentrations of 0. 4 M and above only images of a disordered myofibrillar structure were observed. The results of Bendall(1954) that phyrophosphate increases the water uptake of mince were confirmed. In mince washed to remove endogenous ions and sarcoplasmic proteins, 10 mM phyrophosphate produced more swelling and extraction of protein than NaCl alone were produced in the 0. 1 - 0. 3 M NaCl concentration range but, at higher concentrations it produced inhibition of swelling. However, swelling in washed mince was mince was less than in myofibrils under the same ionic conditions. The results are interpreted by supposing that phyrophosphate promotes the dissociation of actomyosin, changing the myofibrils from a rigor to a relaxed state allowing limited expansion of the filament lattice. In NaCl concentrations above 0. 3 M phyrophosphate is also thought to co-operate with salt <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> the thick filament allowing myosin to be extracted and causing a depression of swelling...|$|R
40|$|Impedance spectroscopic {{studies on}} {{modified}} phospho-vanadate glasses containing SO 42 - ions {{have been carried}} out over wide range of frequency. Modulated DSC studies suggest that the addition of alkali salt makes the glass less rigid and more fragile. The frequency dependent impedance data has been used to calculate d. c conductivity and activation energies. These values are comparable with the other ionic liquids. The conductivity and relaxation phenomenon was rationalized using universal a. c conductivity power law and modulus formalism. The activation energies for relaxation mechanism was also determined using imaginary parts of electrical modulus peaks which were close to those of the d. c conductivity implying the involvement of similar energy barriers in both the processes. Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) stretched exponent beta, is temperature insensitive and power law (s) exponent is temperature dependent. The enhanced conductivity in these glasses is attributed <b>to</b> the <b>depolymerised</b> structure in which migration of Na+ ions proceeds in an expanded network comprising SO 42 - ions in the interstitials. The effect of structure on activation energy is well supported by abinitio DFT computations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of a {{large number}} of gram negative bacteria (Xanthomonas, Erwinia and Pseudomonas) relies on their ability <b>to</b> secrete extracellular <b>depolymerising</b> enzymes, such as cellulases, xylanases, proteases and pectinases [63]. Extracellular enzymes directly or indirectly affect the bacterial population and symptoms in the host, and even determine whether or not the infection will be successful. Several researchers have studied the structure/secretion relationship of cellulase in Xanthomonas and Erwinia because of role of this high potency enzyme in pathogenicity/infection [64 – 66]. Although role of depolymerising enzymes in necrosis and pathogenicity is well documented, the studies on commercial production of cellulases from other plant pathogens including Xanthomonas are almost lacking. Thus, phytopathogens represent sources of promising enzymatic diversity to complement and improve existing cellulase cocktails from Trichoderma.|$|R
40|$|Lignin is {{the only}} plant biomass that {{contains}} aromatic groups in its structure and can provide {{a wide range of}} low molecular weight aromatic chemicals if its depolymerisation can be achieved successfully. Currently, lignin is mainly produced as a waste by-product by the paper and pulp industry and biorefineries. Therefore, the transformation of the phenolic-rich lignin into value added aromatic platform chemicals can be regarded of primary concern to improve the economic profitability of biorefining. Moreover, being a renewable resource, the consumption of fossil fuels will be reduced if lignin can be utilised efficiently. Between chemical degradation and enzymatic degradation, the latter could be a more sustainable method to break down lignin due to its enhanced substrate specificity and ability to preserve the aromatic ring structure compared with chemical processing. Therefore, laccase from Trametes versicolor (LTV), lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were studied to determine the scope <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> both water-soluble and insoluble lignins nder mild reaction conditions. The enzymatic activity and stability of all three enzymes was investigated and optimum assay conditions were achieved. LTV was found to be the most stable enzyme as it maintained 55 % of its activity at least for the first 6 h at 30 °C whereas LiP was deactivated after 2 h at 25 °C, and MnP was deactivated after 1 h at 28 °C. However, LTV stability decreased at higher temperatures during the oxidation of 2, 2 ’-azino-bis (3 - ethylbenthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid (ABTS). One of the non-phenolic lignin model compounds, veratryl alcohol, was oxidised by LTV in the presence of ABTS, thus confirming the published data. The enzymatic degradation of Organosolv lignin (OSL) by LTV resulted in the formation of 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (DBQ). The OSL degradation by LTV was not improved by ethanol addition as a co-solvent although ethanol could stabilise LTV at 40 % (v/v). LTV catalysed the degradation of Kraft lignin although it indicated little effect on lignosulphonates. Lastly, the effect of varying the concentrations of 92 ionic liquids (ILs) and their equivalent metal salts on LTV activity was investigated to find a suitable co-solvent to improve the poor mass transfer in OSL degradation. The study showed that 62 ILs were laccase compatible at an IL concentration of 6 % (w/v) and more than 50 % laccase activity was retained in 18 ionic liquids up to 10 % (w/v), and 80 % (v/v) of dioctyl sulfosuccinate quaternary ammonium salt, [N 4, 4, 4, 4][AOT]. However, there was a progressive loss of activity when the concentrations of the ILs increased. Further study on the enzymatic degradation of ILs-pre-treated OSL is currently ongoing in our research group so that the decomposition of water-insoluble lignin will be understood more comprehensively...|$|R
40|$|Lignin {{is a major}} {{component}} of lignocellulosic biomass and could be an important renewable feedstock in industry for the production of (aromatic) bulk and fine chemicals. To this end, the development of new catalytic processes is required; both <b>to</b> <b>depolymerise</b> the biopolymer into small aromatic building blocks, as well as to further convert these to valuable products. A major challenge in lignin depolymerisation is the recondensation of reactive fragments back to larger, more recalcitrant, fragments. In this thesis, this was circumvented by employing a tandem catalytic depolymerisation procedure. One catalyst, a water-stable Lewis acid, such as scandium triflate, was shown to be responsible for cleaving ether bonds between the lignin monomers, while a second rhodium-based catalyst further converted the liberated small fragments to stable end-products. The rhodium catalyst was shown to have two possible modes of action and the interplay between both catalyst components was shown to be crucial for determining the ultimate product selectivity. Consequently the desired product streams could be chosen: when using a weak Lewis acid, the major products of depolymerisation were 4 -(1 -propenyl) phenols, whereas when using strong Lewis acids, the major products were 4 -methylphenols. The selective oxidation of catechol was studied as a potential route for valorisation of small lignin-derived aromatics. Using an iron(III) complex with a tris(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine ligand as catalyst and molecular oxygen as the reagent, catechol could be readily and selectively converted to derivatives of cis,cis-muconic acid, under mild conditions (50 °C, atmospheric pressure of air). Further two-stage conversion by hydrogenation and transesterification, using commercially available supported catalysts, allowed the isolation of dimethyl adipate in 62 % yield. A systematic investigation of the reaction conditions furthermore allowed the activity of the oxidation step to be increased 35 -fold under optimal conditions (80 °C, 25 bar 5 % O 2 in N 2, 0. 1 mol% catalyst). The catalytic oxidative cleavage reaction was also demonstrated to work directly on catechols obtained from catalytic depolymerisation of candlenut lignin, although the yield of cleavage products found was lower in that case. In addition, the propyl substituent of the lignin-derived catechols drives isomerisation of the cis,cis-muconic acid, leading to significant formation of g-muconolactones instead. The mechanism of this unique and highly selective oxidative carbon-carbon cleavage reaction was investigated using a combined experimental and theoretical study. Based on the combined results, a mechanism is proposed where iron is able to act as a ‘redox’ buffer by taking on an intermediate spin state, enabling the spin-forbidden electron transfer from the catecholate moiety to oxygen. This leads to formation of a bridging peroxide intermediate, which undergoes facile homolytic splitting, leading to oxygen insertion into the aromatic catechol ring. The rate-determining step was found to be the formation of the bridging peroxide. Crucially, the experimentally observed effect of both substrate and ligand substitution was accurately reproduced by the computational study, lending credibility to the mechanism. Importantly, results on other ligand systems reported in literature can now also be understood using this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{more than}} 70 {{million tons of}} lignin are {{produced}} by the {{pulp and paper industry}} every year. However, the utilization of lignin as a source for chemical synthesis is still limited due to the complex and heterogeneous lignin structure. The {{purpose of this study was}} a selective photodegradation of industrially available kraft lignin in order to obtain appropriate fragments and building block chemicals for further utilization, e. g. polymerization. Thus, kraft lignin obtained from soft wood black liquor by acidification was dissolved in sodium hydroxide and irradiated at a wavelength of 254 nm with and without the presence of titanium dioxide in various concentrations. Analyses of the irradiated products via SEC showed decreasing molar masses and decreasing polydispersity indices over time. At the end of the irradiation period the lignin was <b>depolymerised</b> <b>to</b> form fragments as small as the lignin monomers.

40|$|Five {{technical}} lignins (three organosolv, Kraft {{and soda}} lignin) were <b>depolymerised</b> <b>to</b> produce monomeric biobased aromatics, particularly alkylphenols, {{by a new}} two-stage thermochemical approach consisting of dedicated pyrolysis followed by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the resulting pyrolysis oils. Pyrolysis yielded a mixture of guaiacols, catechols and, optionally, syringols in addition to alkylphenols. HDO with heterogeneous catalysts (Ru/C, CoMo/alumina, phosphided NiMO/C) effectively directed the product mixture towards alkylphenols by, among others, demethoxylation. Up to 15 wt% monomeric aromatics of which 11 wt% alkylphenols was obtained (on the lignin intake) with limited solid formation (< 3 wt% on lignin oil intake). For comparison, solid Kraft lignin was also directly hydrotreated for simultaneous depolymerisation and deoxygenation resulting in two times more alkylphenols. However, the alkylphenols concentration in the product oil is higher for the two-stage approach. Future research should compare direct hydrotreatment and the two-stage approach in more detail by techno-economic assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between microtubular dynamics, dismantling of pericentriolar components and induction of apoptosis was analysed after exposure of H 460 non-small lung cancer cells to anti-mitotic drugs. The microtubule destabilising agent, combretastatin-A 4 (CA- 4) led to microtubular array disorganization, arrest in mitosis and abnormal metaphases, {{accompanied by the}} presence of numerous centrosome-independent ‘‘star-like’’ structures containing tubulin and aggregates of pericentrosomal matrix components like c-tubulin, pericentrin and ninein, whereas the structural integrity of centrioles was not affected by treatment. On the contrary, in condition of prolonged exposure or high concentrations of CA- 4 such aggregates never formed. Treatment with 7. 5 nM CA- 4, which produced a high frequency ‘‘star-like’’ aggregates, was accompanied by mitotic catastrophe commitment characterized by translocation of the proapoptotic Bim protein to mitochondria activation of caspases- 3 / 9 and DNA fragmentation as a result of either prolonged metaphase arrest or attempt of cells to divide. Drug concentrations which fail to block cells at mitosis were also unable to activate apotosis. A detailed time-course analysis of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis indicated that after CA- 4 washouthe number of metaphases with ‘‘star-like’’ structures decreased as a function of time and arrested cells proceeded in anaphase. After 4 h, the multiple a- and c-tubulin aggregates coalesced into two well-defined spindles in a bipolar mitotic spindle organization. Overall, our findings suggest that the maintenance of microtubular integrity plays a relevant role in stabilising the pericentriolar matrix, whose dismantling can be associated with apoptosis after exposure <b>to</b> microtubule <b>depolymerising</b> agents...|$|R
