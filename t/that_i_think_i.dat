500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} successes {{as a solo}} artist since 1970, Dark Horse earned Harrison the worst {{critical}} notices of his career. [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] drew a favourable response during the 1974 tour, however, as reviewers commented on the energy with which the band performed the piece. In his feature article on the West Coast concerts, for Rolling Stone, Ben Fong-Torres described the song as a [...] "well-arranged, tension-and-release number", while the Pacific Sun called it [...] "a zingy and classically melodic instrumental... a touchstone of the Harrison style". Reviewing the second show of the tour, D.P. Bond of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: [...] "Harrison's opening instrumental piece was beautiful: the fullest, finest explosion of rock 'n' roll <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have ever heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nadal's playing {{style and}} {{personality}} can be summarised by Jimmy Connors," [...] He's {{built out of}} a mold <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> came from also, that you walk out there, you give everything you have {{from the very first}} point to the end no matter what the score. And you're willing to lay it all out on the line and you're not afraid to let the people see that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A nervous Bhansali, who had met {{the media}} after a long time, said he was very afraid of {{handling}} a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} shyly, [...] "not <b>that</b> altogether. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> meant <b>that</b> they would {{last as long}} as you might care to {{remember}} our acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> case, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall {{take the}} small {{ambulance}} to-day," [...] decided Ajo. [...] "With Dr. Kelsey {{and one of}} the sailors we shall manage very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very little}} at present, Charley. I shall tell your doctor to-night <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am well and <b>that</b> {{you are going}} to nurse me." ...|$|R
60|$|Burr. What {{noise is}} <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hear your cousin Trice's voice.|$|E
60|$|CYRIL. Well, after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{should like}} to hear {{the end of your}} article.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Change your dress, Venetia,' said Lady Annabel; 'lose no time {{in doing}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will send down to Spezzia at once,' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not all}} alike, surely; so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} your question. We have no one like your brother--I may {{go so far as}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a kittle point," [...] {{returned}} the other. [...] "There may be two {{words to say}} to <b>that.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will have heard <b>that</b> you are a man of your sword?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{heard of}} it. But {{it has made}} such a {{difference}} between him and me, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can meddle. Send for Lord Chiltern, and speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; now I hear such {{a dreadful}} {{crackling}} and crashing {{in the forest}} on every side <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall be really afraid,' said the youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, madam," [...] I replied, [...] "my {{materials}} are so ample <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, dear nurse, I've {{had enough}} of sleep. Indeed, I begin to feel so strong <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall very {{soon be able to}} undergo that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> case <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> won't {{come again}} till I'm better." [...] He took the coin and, without {{anything}} more than the elaborate bow with which he always took his leave, went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't you I hate," [...] {{he went on}} monotonously {{breathing}} at her. [...] "No, it isn't you. But if <b>I</b> saw <b>that</b> {{you loved}} <b>that</b> man <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could hate you too." ...|$|R
60|$|HE [humbly] Yes: <b>I</b> deserve <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>I</b> {{were going}} to the stake with you, I should still be so happy with you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hardly feel your danger more than my own.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Another thing,' said Amy, {{colouring}} a good deal; 'shall {{you mind}} my telling Mary? I behaved so oddly last night, {{and she was}} so kind to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ought.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{she said}} aloud. 'To get him here without letting {{him know that}} I have any other object than that of getting a useful man--that's the difficulty--and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can master.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire {{waved at}} Milt and conversed with Aunt Hatty {{in a high}} brisk voice: [...] "This is the nice boy I met on the road <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> told you about, Cousin Hatty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She said <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{would sit}} in her children's schoolroom I should do very well for a penwiper! When things have come to <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> need stand upon ceremony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] {{answered}} the man, with intense humility. [...] "I heard {{only a very}} little at the end, and that so imperfectly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can remember it--I really don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{was tired}} when I {{came in and}} the rest has done me good," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Tredgold, with much simplicity. [...] "Do you know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>I</b> work too hard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{time was}} up yesterday, but I find {{so much to}} {{interest}} me down here <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall stay on {{for a few more}} days, if my host remains as hospitable as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] exclaimed the woodman, {{holding out}} the hem of his tunic; [...] "but you will observe that my skin is brief and open. If you desire one like <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can assist you." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was time}} to speak out. 'No, Mr. Tillington,' I said, with decision. 'I will not let you know. One of my reasons for going is, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had better see no more of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, [...] "I am fond {{of having}} an {{extended}} view of any landscape which happens to please my fancy; but this one {{does not seem to}} possess <b>that</b> merit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr Melmotte. On {{matters such}} as <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can see my own way. I have been in fault in coming in to the Board without {{understanding}} what duties I should have to perform--.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, nothing,' said he, 'I {{was just}} amusing myself with {{counting}} the packs of wolves in the forest, {{but there are}} really {{so many of them}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should ever be done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know how, exactly. I regard Lindau as a {{political}} economist of an unusual type; but I shall not let him array me against the constituted authorities. Short of <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|McCOMAS. There {{can be no}} {{objection}} to <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> have the greatest hopes of a happy settlement. Good-bye for the present. (He goes out, meeting the waiter; who holds the door for him to pass through.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy {{you have}} been out of temper lately," [...] I said. [...] "You have not been your own kinder and better self. Is this the right {{interpretation}} of the change <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see in you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my pretty pair of cooing turtle-doves," [...] went on Sir John {{in a sort}} of shout, {{addressing}} {{himself to}} them, [...] "be so good as to stop <b>that,</b> or <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall wring both your necks, damn you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had ever heard it.|$|R
60|$|I {{ought to}} give you all my {{impressions}} of London, I suppose; but I've grown so used to the place <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have any now. I {{seem to have been}} here years and years.|$|R
