He has been trained to think that Galaxity is always right – even when he {{receives}} orders that go against his morals he will, reluctantly, follow them.

The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E

25|$|Christie {{has been}} purposefully vague about Poirot's origins, as he <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elderly <b>man</b> {{even in the}} early novels.

5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> one {{month and a}} woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of {{his life as a}} woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E

The game presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> integration of previous Maxis titles, presented in 3D, possibly including elements of SimEarth, SimLife, and SimCity.|$|R

25|$|All {{through his}} career, Wakley proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of {{aggressive}} personality, and his experiences had a sensational beginning. In August 1820 {{a gang of}} men (reputedly, the Thistlewood gang) that had some imagined grievance against him burnt down his house and severely wounded him in a murderous assault. The whole affair is obscure. The assault {{may have been a}} follow-up to the Cato Street conspiracy, whose supporters believed (wrongly) that the hangman was a surgeon. Wakley was indirectly accused by the insurance company, which had refused his claim, of setting fire to his house himself. He won his case against the company.|$|E

25|$|The loss of Bolingbroke's great speeches was regretted by William Pitt {{more than}} that of the missing books of Livy and Tacitus. By the early 20th century, the {{writings}} and career of Bolingbroke would make a weaker impression than they made on contemporaries. He was thought by the author in his biography in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English (1910) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of brilliant and versatile talents, but selfish, insincere and intriguing, defects of character which arguably led to his political ruin; and his writings were described as glittering, artificial and lacking philosophical merit. Philip Chesney Yorke, his biographer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th Edition, commented that his abilities were exercised upon ephemeral objects, and not inspired by lasting or universal ideas.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} that pit races {{against one another}} are likely to reflect Tolkien’s critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers {{for a moment the}} humanity of this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of color. Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director’s commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn’t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that’s driving them from their authority, These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien’s experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.|$|E
25|$|His schoolbooks proved Macropedius <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{of great}} humanist culture and {{follower}} of Erasmus. He {{knew all about}} the seven Free Arts and the Three Languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He was very familiar with classic Greek and Roman literature, with the Bible and with {{the writings of the}} Fathers of the Church as well. Many reprints of his textbooks in the Netherlands, in Germany, in France and in England prove that Macropedius’ activities were highly esteemed by his contemporaries and by the next generation of humanists as well. By writing his books and his teachings, Macropedius contributed very much to the successful humanist educational reform {{in the first part of}} the sixteenth century. He indefatigably promoted Greek, not only the reading of the New Testament but also the study of the works of the classic Greek authors.|$|E
25|$|For {{his defense}} of escaped slaves seized in Ohio under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, Chase was dubbed the Attorney General for Fugitive Slaves. His {{argument}} {{in the case of}} Jonesv. Van Zandt on the constitutionality of fugitive slave laws before the U.S.Supreme Court attracted particular attention. In this and similar cases, the court ruled against him, and the judgment against John Van Zandt was upheld. Chase contended that slavery was local, not national, and that it could exist only by virtue of positive state law. He argued that the federal government was not empowered by the Constitution to create slavery anywhere and that when a slave leaves the jurisdiction of a state where slavery is legal, he ceases to be a slave; he continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> and leaves behind the law that made him a slave.|$|E
