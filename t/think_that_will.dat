25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E

It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've {{got a lot of}} things lined up that we want to record, so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E

Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black, saying [...] "there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". The episode makes use of the Talking Heads song [...] "Life During Wartime", taken from their 1979 album Fear of Music.|$|E

[...] But Christ would not that thou shouldst count {{him as one}} <b>that</b> <b>will</b> falsify his word; for he saith of himself, [...] "I am the truth;" [...] {{therefore}} he would not that any that in truth are coming to him, should once <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>will</b> cast them out.|$|R

500|$|Kelly {{believes}} that there's now {{a chance to}} change a political environment he thinks is filled with far too much vitriol. He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric. In {{response to a question}} on February 4, regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said: [...] "I haven’t {{spent a lot of time}} following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby’s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it’s really really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen, so those are good things." ...|$|E

As a token of appreciation, his teammates bought him 100 bottles of wine, of which he said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> furnish me nicely into retirement!" [...] Alastair Cook, his vice-captain and opening partner, was named as his successor. Cook had previously captained England in test matches, {{as well as being}} the current ODI captain.|$|E

If Jesus Christ {{should allow}} those that indeed {{are coming to}} him, once to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>will</b> cast them out, he must allow them to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>will</b> be unfaithful to the trust and charge that his Father hath {{committed}} to him; which is to save, and not to lose anything of that which he hath given unto him to save (John 6:39). But the Father hath given him a charge to save the coming sinner; therefore it cannot be, that he should allow, that such an one should once <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>will</b> cast him out.|$|R

I took it as a compliment, the next thing you should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen when we finally release this album." ...|$|E

2500|$|At [...] below {{sea level}} and [...] below the {{mountains}} {{on either side of}} the scorching Jordan Valley, here for weeks at a time, the shade temperature rarely dropped below [...] and occasionally reached at the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead [...] was recorded. Coupled with the heat, the tremendous evaporation of the Dead Sea which keeps the still, heavy atmosphere moist, adds to the discomfort and produces a feeling of lassitude which is most depressing and difficult to overcome. In addition to these unpleasant conditions the valley swarms with snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, great black spiders, and men and animals were tormented by day and night by swarms of every sort of fly. Trooper R. W. Gregson 2663, described the Jordan Valley to his family, [...] "...it's a terrible place.
