40|$|Generally, {{international}} {{passenger transport}} {{is exempt from}} the value added tax, {{in the case of}} air transport. International road passenger transport is however liable to taxation. However, the Council Directive on Value Added Tax contains a number of variations in the frame of the taxation of international passenger transport both for the states that joined the Community after January 1, 1978 and also for countries that were members of the Community on January 1, 1978. The international passenger transport is therefore rather problematic field due to a number of exceptions for individual Member States. It is on the providers or recipients of transport services to inform correctly about the taxation of international road transport and to pay properly the tax. The aim of the article is to evaluate the possibilities of the taxation of international passenger transport in the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovak Republic, Germany and Poland and to determine how the taxation of international passenger transport affects the tax liability and price of travel services provided in this country. From the comparative analysis it is evident that the <b>tax</b> <b>paid</b> <b>abroad</b> {{should be included in the}} total price of the purchased service. Based on the comparative analysis there will be a proposal for the taxation of international passenger transport so that the tax collection in the monitored countries would be simplified. The proposal recommends to unify an approach during the taxation of international passenger transport for all Member States of the European Union in order to reduce administrative costs on the part of the governments and individual entities...|$|E

40|$|Optimal-tax theory {{forecasts}} {{that small}} open economies should not tax capital income. Yet, countries do tax capital income. Why the inconsistency? This paper shows {{that use of}} the double-taxation convention, whereby governments credit <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> <b>abroad</b> against domestic <b>taxes,</b> helps explain this inconsistency. In particular, capital income will be taxed if a dominant capital exporter acts as a Stackelberg leader when setting its tax policy. Due to the convention, other countries will then tax capital imports, making it attractive for the dominant capital exporter to tax capital income. Without a dominant capital exporter, however, the model still forecasts no capital-income taxes. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

Our nation 2 ̆ 7 s system for taxing international income today is largely a creature of the period 1918 - 1928, a time when the income tax was itself in childhood. From the inception of the income tax (1913 for individuals, 1909 for corporations) until 1918, foreign taxes were deducted like any other business expense. In 1918, the foreign tax credit (FTC) was enacted. This unilateral decision by the United States to allow <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> <b>abroad</b> to reduce U. S. tax liability dollar for dollar—taken principally to redress the unfairness of 2 ̆ 2 double taxation 2 ̆ 2 of foreign source income—was extraordinarily generous to those nations where U.

40|$|The {{integration}} of world capital markets carries {{important implications for}} the design and impact of tax policies. This paper evaluates research findings on international taxation, drawing attention to connections and inconsistencies between theoretical and empirical observations. Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) note that small open economies incur very high costs in attempting to tax the returns to local capital investment, since local factors {{bear the burden of}} such taxes in the form of productive inefficiencies. Richman (1963) argues that countries may simultaneously want to tax the worldwide capital income of domestic residents, implying that any <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> to foreign governments should be merely deductible from domestic taxable income. Governments do not adopt policies that are consistent with these forecasts. Corporate income is taxed at high rates by wealthy countries, and most countries either exempt foreign-source income of domestic multinationals from tax provide credits rather than deductions for <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> <b>abroad.</b> Furthermore, individual investors can use various methods to avoid domestic taxes on their foreign-source incomes, in the process also avoiding taxes on their domestic-source incomes. Individual and firm behavior also differs from that forecast by simple theories. Observed portfolios are not fully diversified worldwide. Foreign direct investment is common even when it faces tax penalties relative to other investment in host countries. While economic activity, and tax avoidance activity, is highly responsive to tax rates and tax structure, there are many aspects of tax-motivated behavior that are difficult to reconcile with simple microeconomic incentives. There are promising recent efforts to reconcile observations with theory. To the extent that multinational firms possess intangible capital on which they earn returns with foreign direct investment, even small countries may have a degree of market power, leading to fiscal externalities. Tax avoidance is pervasive, generating further fiscal externalities. These concepts are useful in explaining behavior, and observed tax policies, and they also suggest that international agreements have the potential to improve the efficiency of tax systems worldwide. ...|$|R

40|$|Corporate tax related {{empirical}} research often uses effective tax rates to investigate cross- sectional {{differences in the}} tax attributes of companies. Effective tax rates are often defined as (current or total) tax expense over financial accounting income before taxes, where the (current or total) tax expense is {{an estimate of the}} actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> This approximation of the actual tax payment by using tax expense is often used, as the actual tax payment and taxable income were or are proprietary information, thereby rendering it difficult if not impossible to use this information to calculate effective tax rates. Due to changes in financial accounting standards more information on the actual tax payment and taxable income is now generally available in US financial statements. This paper argues that the use of an effective tax rate measure utilizing tax expenses has some inherent dangers which are to a lesser extent the case in an effective tax rate using actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> Two inherent dangers of a tax expense based ETR measure are the quality of the tax expense measure as an estimation of the actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> and timing differences between tax expense and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid.</b> The differences between tax expenses and actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> ETRs are researched in an empirical study as well as other proposed ETR measures. Results from this empirical study indicate that in certain situations it is more appropriate to use an effective tax rate measure based on actual <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> rather than on tax expenses. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the Swedish CFC (Controlled foreign corporation) legislations compatibility with the EC law, freedom of establishment and towards those double taxation agreements that Sweden have signed with other states. The study is interesting and important for several reasons. There are two main ones. Fist of all; if the court in Luxemburg finds the CFC legislation not compatible with the freedom of establishment - the Swedish internal laws, in purpose of protecting tax avoidance by companies in tax havens, will suddenly be inoperative towards companies established inside the Union. Secondly; the same result will be a fact if the internal law is considered to be incompatible with the agreements that Sweden has signed with other states, in order to avoid double taxation. If the legislation is incompatible with the EC law, the problem is quite big, but anyway limited to the 25 countries that today constitute the Union. No quick or simple solution is to be found. If it is not compatible with the agreements, the problem is greater - since Sweden have 70 complete agreements - though, a problem simpler to solve. The purposes of the CFC legislation are to eliminate tax advantages of the shareholder when he transfers his earnings to a CFC corporation - or when he defers the taxation by postponing the dividend from the same corporation. Such postponement could otherwise be a fact, for all future. If the level of taxation, in the foreign corporation is lower than 15. 4 %, the incomes are considered to be a CFC income and are CFC taxed - if the owner holds 25 % control of the assets or votes of the corporation, directly or indirectly. The income is calculated according to Swedish rules for the same type of company and credit is given for <b>taxes</b> <b>paid</b> <b>abroad.</b> The Swedish exchange control was abolished in 1992. The control restrained the possibilities to establish enterprises abroad by prohibiting the export of securities or other means of payment without the consent of the bank of Sweden. The abolishment of exchange controls has provided opportunities for tax avoidance. To prevent such avoidance, many countries have introduced legislations that tax shareholders directly - even though the profits from the foreign controlled companies not yet have been distributed. Besides the restrains on foreign investments caused by the control, the CFC legislation was preceded by the less extensive “Luxemburg paragraph” - introduced in 1933. This paragraph has not much in common with today's legislation - the real means of preventing tax avoidance came with the CFC legislation 1990. The last decades have seen much more of harmful tax competition, and both the EU and the OECD have come up with strategies to tackle these problems. In order to prevent the problems, the organisations suggest the member states to introduce some form of CFC legislation. The first of July 2003 a new legislation came into effect, giving companies a right to bring back profits or earnings without taxation, if the companies are closely tied to each other or the possession of owning the company are due to dependence between them - when holding a kind of business related shares. Such rules were needed to avoid that some companies - or a combined groups of companies - would have to pay taxes three or four times for the same earnings. With the possibility of bringing profits and earnings back to Sweden tax free, a new possible problem occurred. According to the government, there was a risk that a company based in Sweden choose to have a loan of money in Sweden, only in order to transfer the money to a tax haven. The result would be that the cost would appear in Sweden while the earnings would appear in a low tax regime. Later, whenever it would be suitable, the earnings - or the profits from selling the foreign corporation - could be brought back to Sweden. In order to tackle such, and other, tax avoidance, Sweden introduced the new legislation for CFC companies, the first of January 2004. These rules are now the subject of analysis, in relation to the EC law, freedom of establishment, and the double taxation agreements, signed by Sweden. The study is made in Swedish, but with an English summary...|$|R
