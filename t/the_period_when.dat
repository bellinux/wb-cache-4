25|$|When {{discussing}} {{the history of}} rail transport in the Netherlands, one can roughly distinguish six eras, namely <b>the</b> <b>period</b> up to 1839, when the first plans were made for a railroad; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1840-1860, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> railroads experienced their early expansion; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1860-1890, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> government started to order {{the construction of new}} lines; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1890-1938, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> railroads were consolidated into two large railroads; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1938-1992, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Nederlandse Spoorwegen was granted a monopoly on rail transport; and finally <b>the</b> <b>period</b> from 1992 to the present, when the Nederlandse Spoorwegen lost its monopoly.|$|R

5|$|In China, {{rammed earth}} walls were {{built by the}} Longshan people in 2600–1900 BC, during <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> cities first {{appeared}} in the region. Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as Sikkim. The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of Carthage was built of rammed earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.|$|E
5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans.

5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston.

5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>when</b> adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
