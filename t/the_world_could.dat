Memorial services were held in both Trinidad and New York City, so that Beebe's friends in both parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> attend. Following Beebe's death, Jocelyn succeeded him {{as the director of}} the Department of Tropical Research, and continued to run the Simla station along with the rest of Beebe's former staff.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>could</b> only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E

25|$|The great {{influence}} of the 17th century was the French philosopher, René Descartes (1596–1650), whose Meditations (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century. Writing during the scientific revolution, Descartes proposed a mechanistic theory of the universe, the aim of which was to show that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience.|$|E
25|$|The broad {{availability}} of low-cost Internet connections {{starting in the}} mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined.

Unlike most other 4X games, Pax had much more complex solar systems, including moving planets, their moons, and a habitable temperature zone that varied depending on the star and the races preferences.|$|R

Its goal was to create a Jewish homeland in whatever possible territory in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be found for them, with speculations including Canada, Australia, Mesopotamia, Uganda and Cyrenaica.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he took a}} job as {{a teacher}} in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he {{continued}} to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if people could be taught to think with the reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be alleviated.|$|E
25|$|By {{reason of}} the very purity of His being, God is {{distinguished}} from all finite beings.

25|$|Self-sufficiency had {{traditionally}} been a powerful stimulus for exploring and developing the country's huge, yet widely dispersed, resource base. It remained {{a source of}} national pride that the Soviet Union, alone among the industrialized countries of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>could</b> claim the ability to satisfy almost all the requirements of its economy using its own natural resources. The abundance of fossil fuels supplied not just the Soviet Union's domestic needs. For many years, an ample surplus was exported to consumers in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where it earned most of the Soviet Union's convertible currency.|$|E
25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} was $32,285, and the median income for a family was $37,767. Males had a median income of $31,236 versus $25,183 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,838. About 17.2% of families and 20.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.1% of those under age 18, and 15.4% of those age 65 or over. In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the Memphis area as the poorest large metro area in the country. Dr. Jeff Wallace of the University of Memphis noted that the problem was related to decades of segregation in government and schools. He {{said that it was}} a low-cost job market, but other places in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> offer cheaper labor, and the workforce was undereducated for today's challenges.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 the Chief Scout of Switzerland, Walther von Bonstetten, visited Kandersteg {{on holiday}} {{and found an}} old empty chalet. It was built in 1908 to house the {{construction}} workers for the Lötschberg Tunnel. In 1913, when the tunnel was finished, the chalet was left unused by the railway company. Von Bonstetten felt that this location could be the permanent international meeting place that Robert Baden-Powell had in mind where Scouts from all over <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> meet. Von Bonstetten wrote to him {{to let him know}} what he had found. The response was positive and on 12 February 1923 the Scouts International Home Association was set up; on 12 April 1923 the chalet and adjacent land were bought for CHF 15,100, and the International Scout Centre came into existence. In 1930 Baden-Powell visited the site himself.|$|E

25|$|By November 2014, {{the game}} was {{entering}} {{the final stages of}} production. While Nintendo had decided not to create an official website at that point, Monolith Soft decided to create their own website for the game. While they initially thought Nintendo would object, they were allowed to go ahead with creating and maintaining the website. Monolith Soft also created an official Twitter account for the game alongside the new website. Xenoblade Chronicles X was published in Japan by Nintendo on April 29, 2015. The Japanese version came with standard and a hardware bundle featuring a version of the game with a reversible cover, black Wii U console and gamepad, and an artbook. Alongside the game's release, downloadable content (DLC) was made available for purchase, featuring four new characters with accompanying stories split between three quests, and optional data packs to speed loading times. The data packs were provided so that when flying Skells portions of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be loaded from storage to make for a smoother playing experience.|$|E
25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and condition... No horse in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>could</b> have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E
