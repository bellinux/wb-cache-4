5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prints</b> were {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|Boydell's Shakespeare project {{contained}} three parts: {{an illustrated}} edition of Shakespeare's plays; a folio of prints from the gallery (originally {{intended to be}} a folio of prints from the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> would hang.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate onto <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> substrate. <b>The</b> pad <b>printing</b> is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, on <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> product. <b>The</b> photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, consequently on the reproduction of <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate elements. For this purpose four pad printing plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form printing elements of desired depth...|$|R
5|$|The {{publisher}} {{yielded to}} Bauer for the 1912 edition; he was again illustrating his own book. Printing techniques {{had also been}} updated and the pictures could be printed in three colors: black, yellow and blue. With this technical improvement, <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> almost resembled Bauer's original paintings.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular and could be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. <b>The</b> <b>prints</b> were usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Ian Levine located another 65 episodes {{from the}} show's first six seasons (plus {{fourteen}} previously existing episodes), at the BBC Enterprises film vault at Villiers House in London. The episodes comprise 17 full serials, mostly from seasons 1 and 2. According to Levine, many of <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> were flagged to be junked that very day.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Merchant Ivory Productions, with {{assistance}} from the Academy Film Archive and Sony Pictures Classics, undertook a project to restore <b>the</b> <b>prints.</b> The restored prints, along with several other Ray films, were released in select US theatres. Pather Panchali is available in DVD in Region 2 (DVD region code) PAL and Region 1 NTSC formats. Artificial Eye Entertainment is the distributor of Region 2 while Columbia Tri-Star is the distributor of Region 1 format.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Ansel Adams {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his {{photographs}} of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E

40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} {{a printing}} plate elastically deformed during the reproduction process. <b>The</b> <b>printing</b> plate is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the plate enables <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other <b>printing</b> techniques. On <b>the</b> other hand, deformations of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and <b>the</b> substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process, <b>the</b> plate making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate, and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of screen ruling on <b>the</b> formation of <b>printing</b> elements and <b>the</b> adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate making process in order to achieve optimal quality of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in <b>the</b> processes of <b>printing</b> plate curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different screen ruling has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|R
5|$|While {{reviewing}} the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean {{was watching the}} night he was murdered had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated time of death was wrong. The forensic results about <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> in O'Dell’s room come back, {{and they are the}} fingerprints of Steve Botando (Richard Grieco). Steve Botando is investigated by Sheriff Lamb.|$|E
5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{was well}} acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who {{had been unable to}} make a living as writer and had {{eventually}} ended up at the Fleet Prison as a bankrupt. Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E

5|$|The press {{reported}} weekly on {{the building}} of Boydell's gallery, designed by George Dance the Younger, on a site in Pall Mall. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as Joshua Reynolds, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations {{had to be done}} by lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prints</b> and {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to {{the fragility of the}} paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match <b>the</b> <b>prints.</b> Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>print</b> had {{a clearly}} marked “W” on the recto, {{along with other}} writing that {{appeared}} to be the initials “H.B.”. After carefully studying <b>the</b> <b>print,</b> Schaaf speculated that the “W” might be the initial of Thomas Wedgwood and that <b>the</b> <b>print</b> possibly could have been produced as early as 1805. Based upon the uncertainty surrounding its authorship and age, Sotheby’s withdrew <b>the</b> <b>print</b> from <b>the</b> sale pending further research.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>print</b> is then floated {{face down}} in a bath of room-temperature water to allow the soluble gum, excess dichromate, and pigment to wash away. Several changes of water bath are {{necessary}} to clear <b>the</b> <b>print.</b> Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>print</b> is hung to dry. When all layers are complete and dry, a clearing bath of sodium metabisulfite is used to extract any remaining dichromate so <b>the</b> <b>print</b> will be archival.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>printing</b> {{process has}} been {{improved}} by ORNL since July 2014, bringing <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> time of 140 hours down to less than 45 hours in September. Since IMTS, ORNL has brought <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> time of <b>the</b> Strati to less than 24 hours and is continuing their research efforts with <b>the</b> hope of <b>printing</b> <b>the</b> car in less than 10 hours.|$|R
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in <b>the</b> <b>prints</b> from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal <b>the</b> <b>prints.</b> Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of <b>the</b> <b>prints,</b> a woman standing back from the window looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E
