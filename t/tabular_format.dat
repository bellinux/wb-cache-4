This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information {{can be sent to}} major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tabular</b> <b>formatting</b> {{determines the}} {{physical}} dimensions of tables according to size constraints. Many {{factors contribute to}} the complexity of the formatting process so we analyze the computational complexity of <b>tabular</b> <b>formatting</b> with respect to different restrictions. We also present an algorithm for <b>tabular</b> <b>formatting</b> that we have implemented in a prototype system. It supports automatic line breaking and size constraints expressed as linear equalities or inequalities. This algorithm determines in polynomial time the physical dimensions for many tables although it takes exponential-time in the worst case. Indeed, we have shown elsewhere that the formatting problem it solves is NP-complete. 1 Introduction When we design a table, we first decide on the logical structure by taking into account the readers' requirements and convenience. Then, we specify the topology to arrange the items in two dimensions and select a presentational style so that the logical structure of the table [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|ICD-11 invokes a more {{sophisticated}} architecture than historical versions, consistent with its generation as a digital resource. [...] The core content of the system, called the Foundation Component, is a semantic network of words and terms, where any given term can {{have more than one}} parent. [...] To address the requirement that statistical classifications exhibit mutual exclusiveness (so events are not counted more than once) and exhaustiveness (so there is a place to tally all events), ICD11 supports the serialization of the Foundation Component into an arbitrary number of linearizations, optimized for use cases. [...] The main linearization, presently called the Joint Linearization for Morbidity and Mortality Statistics, is the <b>tabular</b> <b>format</b> with which most traditional users will become familiar. However, other linearizations, for primary care, multiple sub-specialty derivatives, or applications such as clinical decision support are possible. [...] Finally, preliminary work in partnership with the IHTSDO is underway to ensure that the ICD-11 Foundation Component is semantically coherent through development of the Common Ontology, a subset of SNOMED CT which will anchor the Foundation Component to terms defined through description logic.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Common Prayer (BCP), {{originally}} The boke of {{the common}} praier and administracion of the sacramentes : and other rites and ceremonies of the Churche : after {{the use of the}} Churche of Englande, is the short title of a number of related prayer books used in the Anglican Communion, {{as well as by the}} Continuing Anglican, [...] "Anglican realignment" [...] and other Anglican Christian churches. The original book, published in 1549 in the reign of Edward VI, was a product of the English Reformation following the break with Rome. Prayer books, unlike books of prayers, contain the words of structured (or liturgical) services of worship. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. It contained Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, the Litany, and Holy Communion and also the occasional services in full: the orders for Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage, [...] "prayers to be said with the sick", and a funeral service. It also set out in full the [...] "propers" [...] (that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or, at times, daily throughout the Church's Year): the collects and the epistle and gospel readings for the Sunday Communion Service. Old Testament and New Testament readings for daily prayer were specified in <b>tabular</b> <b>format</b> as were the Psalms; and canticles, mostly biblical, that were provided to be said or sung between the readings [...]|$|E

In this paper, we propose a fast and simple semi-automatic tabular-to-RDF mapping approach.

Finally, we use efficient string and lexical matching approaches in a learning loop to ensure high performance with good precision. ...|$|R
