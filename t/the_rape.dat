5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> of the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> of the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The moon is also designated UranusI.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rapes</b> may {{be grouped}} in regions, most {{commonly}} two geographic divisions within Sussex. <b>The</b> <b>Rapes</b> of Arundel, Bramber and Chichester comprised Sussex's western division; <b>the</b> <b>Rapes</b> of Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey comprised Sussex's eastern division. These divisions {{formed the basis of}} the areas administered by East and West Sussex County Councils and the non-metropolitan counties of East Sussex and West Sussex that were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.|$|R

50|$|In {{cases of}} <b>rape,</b> <b>the</b> woman {{is not seen}} as a victim. Instead, it is {{considered}} that the namus of the whole family has been violated, and to restore it, an honor killing of <b>the</b> <b>raped</b> woman may happen (estimated 5,000 victims yearly and on the rise worldwide). <b>The</b> <b>raped</b> woman may also commit forced suicide. In Pakistan, acid is often thrown on the victim's face to disfigure her {{as an alternative to}} murder.|$|R

5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E

2500|$|A medical {{study of}} 68 Croatian and Bosniak victims of <b>rape</b> during <b>the</b> 1992–1995 war {{found that many}} {{suffered}} psychological problems as a result. None had any psychiatric history prior to <b>the</b> <b>rapes.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> 25 had suicidal thoughts, 58 suffered depression immediately after and 52 were still suffering from depression {{at the time of}} the study, one year later. Of the women 44 had been raped more than once and 21 of them had been raped daily throughout their captivity. Twenty-nine of them had become pregnant and seventeen had an abortion. The study reached the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> had [...] "deep immediate and long-term consequences on the mental-health" [...] of the women.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> is not known. [...] It is {{possible}} that <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> represent <b>the</b> shires of the ancient kingdom of Sussex, especially as in the 12th century they had sheriffs of their own. [...] According to John Morris the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>Rapes</b> of Lewes and Pevensey, which cuts {{through the middle of}} Lewes, probably pre-dates the founding of Lewes in the late 9th or early 10th century. If one boundary had existed so early then {{it is quite possible that}} other boundaries also existed. [...] Sussex's rapes may have been a similar division to the six or seven lathes of neighbouring Kent which were undoubtedly early administrative units.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> case the number of female tourists fell by 35% compared to the period the previous year according to an industry survey by ASSOCHAM. The Foreign Office of the UK modified its travel advice and advised women against travelling alone.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 18th century, between 1716 and 1719, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, author of <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> of the Lock, lived in Chiswick – in the {{building}} which is now the Mawson Arms {{at the corner of}} Mawson Lane. Another 18th-century resident was the actor Charles Holland, who was born in Chiswick in 1733.|$|E

Jacqui forgives him, and Gilly decides that he must leave the village. He confesses <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> to everyone in his life and says his goodbyes. Cheryl in particular is devastated by Gilly's abrupt departure and begs for him to stay, but he refuses. Jacqui comforts Cheryl as she sobs on the steps outside her flat, while Gilly and Rhys share one final look goodbye before he leaves the village forever.|$|E
50|$|Angela Davis {{contends that}} <b>the</b> {{systematic}} <b>rape</b> of female slaves {{is analogous to}} the medieval concept of droit du seigneur, believing that <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> were a deliberate effort by slaveholders to extinguish resistance in women and reduce them to the status of animals.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rapes</b> were {{traditional}} subdivisions of Sussex. <b>The</b> six <b>rapes</b> each {{consisted of}} a strip of territory from the northern border of the county to its southern coast, so the area involved was considerably larger {{than that of the}} normal Parliamentary borough.|$|R

5|$|In 1110, King Henry I took Cardigan {{from his}} {{appointee}} Owain ap Cadwgan, son of Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, ostensibly {{as punishment for}} a number of crimes including that of <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> and abduction of his cousin Nest, wife of Gerald de Windsor and ward of King Henry I. In turn Henry gave the Lordship of Cardigan (as the Normans called Ceredigion), including Cardigan Castle, to Gilbert fitz Richard, Earl of Clare, who imposed a string of castles through the lordship.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E
5|$|In Erdely's story, Jackie {{disclosed}} to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{the identity of}} her date to the fraternity party {{and said that he}} was the ringleader of <b>the</b> <b>rape.</b> Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E
50|$|The Local Government Act 1888 {{introduced}} administrative counties each {{governed by}} an elected county council. Sussex {{was divided into}} two administrative counties: With {{the exception of the}} county boroughs of Brighton, Hastings and from 1911, Eastbourne, East Sussex County Council administered <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> of Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings, while West Sussex County Council administered <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> of Chichester, Arundel and Bramber. Each county council was required to adopt a common seal.|$|R
5000|$|No {{physical}} {{evidence from the}} car was presented in the Simmons case to tie him to <b>the</b> alleged <b>rapes.</b> No {{physical evidence}} was presented to prove that <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> had occurred. <b>The</b> case was based on testimony by the Sanders' twins and LaBorde. Simmons' defense presented several alibi eyewitnesses who said that Simmons was with them at a local bar the night of <b>the</b> <b>rapes.</b> Knoll attacked <b>the</b> credibility of these witnesses {{in front of the}} jury, suggesting that prior minor crimes of the witnesses, such as littering, parking fines, and disturbing the peace, should affect their credibility.|$|R

5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency.

5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> {{of a woman}} by a bull in a re-creation of the myth of Pasiphaë.

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{definition}} of <b>rape</b> changed.

5000|$|At some {{stage in}} the Saxon period Sussex was divided into {{administrative}} areas which became known as 'Rapes'.
