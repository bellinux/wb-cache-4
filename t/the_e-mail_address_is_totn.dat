50|$|While {{the basic}} concept was effective, the Penet remailer had several {{vulnerabilities}} which threatened {{the anonymity of}} its users. Chief among them was the need to store a list of real <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> mapped to <b>the</b> corresponding anonymous <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> on <b>the</b> server. A potential attacker needed only to access that list to compromise the identities of all of Penet’s users.

50|$|Claims were {{initially}} made via an e-mail sent to news agencies {{by a group}} calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen (Urdu: دکن مجاہدین; {{also referred to as}} Mujahideen Hyderabad Deccan). The Internet connection from which <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> was originally sent was reportedly traced to Russia, and was considered, for this reason, likely to be bogus by some intelligence experts such as B Raman, who spoke to NewsX. Further analysis, however, determined that <b>the</b> Russian <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>was</b> registered to a computer user located in Pakistan, and routed through Lahore. India's RAW intelligence agency suggested that voice recognition software had been used to create <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> content. Analysis shows that the language of the manifesto corresponds to similar language used by a prior Indian Mujahideen manifesto issued after a New Delhi bombing in September 2008, thus raising the possibility that the authors may be linked. A factor weighing against this likelihood, however, is <b>the</b> language: <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> purportedly sent by the Deccan Mujahideen was written in Hindi with some Urdu words, and used a relatively mild tone, compared with previous Indian Mujahideen e-mails, which have been in English.|$|R

40|$|The wetting {{reactions}} between eutectic AuSn solder and Au foil {{have been}} studied. During the reflowing, Au foil dissolution {{occurred at the}} interface of AuSn/Au, which increases with temperature and time. The activation energy for Au dissolution in molten AuSn solder is determined to be 41. 7 kJ/mol. Au 5 Sn is the dominant interfacial compound layer formed at interface. The activation energy {{for the growth of}} interfacial Au 5 Sn phase layer is obtained to be 54. 3 kJ/mol over the temperature range 360 ℃ to 440 ℃. Wettability of the molten AuSn solder ball is a temperature-dependence process. At 390 ℃, AuSn solder balls exhibited best wettability among all reflowing cases (wetting angle is about 25 °). Kinetics of wetting was proposed to be controlled by the oxidation and Au dissolution rates on the wetting front of spreading molten AuSn solder. Below 390 ℃, the Au dissolution rate dominates the progression of the wetting front. On other hands, above 390 ℃, the oxidation rate exceeds Au dissolution rate, thus, wetting was rearded. <b>The</b> corresponding author's <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> chengyi@cc. ncu. edu. tw...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{electronic}} mail system in the 1970 s, a new opportunity for direct marketing using unsolicited electronic mail became apparent. In 1978, Gary Thuerk compiled a list of those on the Arpanet and then sent out a huge mailing publicising Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC—now Compaq) systems. The reaction from the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), who ran Arpanet, was very negative, and it was this negative reaction that ensured that {{it was a long time}} before unsolicited e-mail was used again (Templeton, 2003). As long as the U. S. government controlled a major part of the backbone, most forms of commercial activity were forbidden (Hayes, 2003). However, in 1993, the Internet Network Information Center was privatized, and with no central government controls, spam, as it is now called, came into wider use. The term spam was taken from the Monty Python Flying Circus (a UK comedy group) and their comedy skit that featured the ironic spam song sung in praise of spam (luncheon meat) —“spam, spam, spam, lovely spam”—and it came to mean mail that was unsolicited. Conversely, the term ham came to mean e-mail that was wanted. Brad Templeton, a UseNet pioneer and chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, has traced the first usage of the term spam back to MUDs (Multi User Dungeons), or real-time multi-person shared environment, and the MUD community. These groups introduced the term spam to the early chat rooms (Internet Relay Chats). The first major UseNet (the world’s largest online conferencing system) spam sent in January 1994 and was a religious posting: “Global alert for all: Jesus is coming soon. ” The term spam was more broadly popularised in April 1994, when two lawyers, Canter and Siegel from Arizona, posted a message that advertized their information and legal services for immigrants applying for the U. S. Green Card scheme. The message was posted to every newsgroup on UseNet, and after this incident, the term spam became synonymous with junk or unsolicited e-mail. Spam spread quickly among the UseNet groups who were easy targets for spammers simply because <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of members <b>were</b> widely available (Templeton, 2003) ...|$|R
