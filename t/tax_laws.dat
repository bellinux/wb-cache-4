Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and <b>tax</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|E

5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the <b>tax</b> <b>laws</b> permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E

On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income <b>tax,</b> <b>laws</b> to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E

40|$|International {{taxation}} {{has taken}} {{a central role in}} the ongoing political and economic crisis. There is a growing consensus in society that there is a need to change the current rules and norms of international taxation, since the changes in society are not properly reflected in the body of <b>law</b> called 'international <b>tax</b> law'. The starting point of this study is therefore that international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> is struggling with legitimacy problems in a society that is changing very quickly. The objective of this study is to improve the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> In this respect, it focuses on two separate 'tracks': the legal framework of international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> and the contribution of social-scientific knowledge to the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> The first part of the study concerns a research of the development of international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> in the period following the Second World War. This includes an analysis of the changing characteristics of international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> and the development of the dominant norms of international taxation. The second part of the study considers the possibilities to improve the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> In this respect, the study considers both the work of the German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas, and the possibilities and limitations of the contribution of social-scientific knowledge to the contribution of the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> The latter element is, for example, relevant in order to evaluate the domination of capital import neutrality and capital export neutrality as ‘sources’ of the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> in the history of this field of law. Finally, the third part of the study does recommendations to improve the legitimacy of international <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> on the basis of the findings of the first parts of the study.

40|$|The thesis {{tries to}} provide {{an answer to the}} problem of tax avoidance. For this purpose a reinterpretation of taxes as {{practices}} of mutual recognition is defended. The conception of taxation and <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> defended in the thesis contrast sharply to the merely instrumental or functional conceptions of taxation and <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> that dominates today’s common understanding of taxation and <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> The thesis lays out the basis for a new general theory of <b>tax</b> <b>law,</b> but does not develop in detail each of the elements of such a theory. The thesis first lays out the problem by analysing different definitions of tax avoidance, tax evasion, and tax planning, as well as their shortcomings. From that discussion, it emerges that the ways in which tax avoidance has been conceptualised are not only unclear but they also fail to produce any relevant insight into the problem of tax avoidance. The thesis then relates those shortcomings to what it calls the classical paradigm of <b>tax</b> <b>law,</b> which leads, in turn, to the contemporary general theory of <b>tax</b> <b>law.</b> A combination of these conceptions – of the substance (function) and form of <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> – explains that the structure of <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> is based on a conception of the obligation to pay taxes in which there is space for tax avoidance. The thesis argues that, in doing so, the purpose of <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> is defeated. Recent alternatives to the contemporary general theory are also analysed and critically evaluated. The second part of the thesis develops the positive aspect of the argument, in three connected moves. First, an argument is provided to prove that both liberal egalitarian and luck egalitarian theories of justice are not able to offer an answer to tax avoidance because they consider <b>taxes</b> and <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> to be mere instruments for redistribution. Second, a substantive reinterpretation of taxation as a practice with an internal good is presented, in which mutual recognition is defended as taxation’s internal good. Finally, an argument for the thesis that the best possible understanding of <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> requires us to interpret it as a teleological institution is provided. With this positive programme, the thesis aims at providing a superior alternative to the merely instrumental conception of taxation and <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> that derives from the classical paradigm presented at the outset. Its superiority is evidenced {{by the fact that the}} alternative provided can offer us the conceptual resources to understand the problem of tax avoidance and hence of what <b>tax</b> <b>law</b> is about...|$|R
