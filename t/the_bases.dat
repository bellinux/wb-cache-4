5|$|In 2016 {{the first}} stable semisynthetic {{organism}} was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). <b>The</b> <b>bases</b> survived cell division.|$|E
5|$|Interstitial cells, {{which are}} unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by {{transforming}} into the appropriate types. These are found between <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|Nerve cells. Sensory cells appear between or {{sometimes}} {{on top of}} the muscle cells, and communicate via synapses (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with motor nerve cells, which lie mostly between <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of the muscle cells.|$|E
50|$|The full model {{introduces}} the virtual terminal, B', so that <b>the</b> <b>base</b> spreading resistance, rbb, (the bulk resistance between <b>the</b> <b>base</b> contact and <b>the</b> active region of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> under <b>the</b> emitter) and rb'e (representing <b>the</b> <b>base</b> current {{required to make}} up for recombination of minority carriers in <b>the</b> <b>base</b> region) can be represented separately. Ce is the diffusion capacitance representing minority carrier storage in <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> <b>The</b> feedback components, rb'c and Cc, are introduced to represent the Early effect.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> of <b>the</b> Induan stage (which is also <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of <b>the</b> Lower Triassic series, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of <b>the</b> Triassic {{system and}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of <b>the</b> Mesozoic erathem) {{is defined as}} the place in the fossil record where Hindeodus parvus first appears.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} telephones have a handset speakerphone {{as well as}} a <b>base</b> speakerphone. <b>The</b> handset speakerphone allows {{hands free}} conversations away from <b>the</b> <b>base</b> unit. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> speakerphone is located in <b>the</b> <b>base</b> unit. <b>The</b> user must be at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> unit, but still gets the added benefits of having hands free conversations. Most base speakerphones have a secondary keypad for dialing calls on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> unit.|$|R
5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope with liquid food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump {{digestive}} enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the fangs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species the fangs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{responded in}} the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> Bonds came to bat with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a sacrifice fly and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5–3 for the Cubs.|$|E
5|$|The IISS, in its 2007 {{edition of}} the Military Balance, {{confirms}} <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> listed in Jane's and adds a fifth base at Boma, a coastal city near Matadi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Base</b> {{parallelogram}}: <b>The</b> <b>base</b> parallelogram {{is attached}} to two fixed pivot points {{at the far side}} of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> plate. <b>The</b> pivoting arms are supported at their midpoints by wheels which rest on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and this part remains in a plane parallel to <b>the</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{emissions}} {{limitations of}} Annex I Parties varies between different Parties. [...] Some Parties have emissions limitations reduce below <b>the</b> <b>base</b> year level, some have limitations at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> year level (i.e., no permitted increase above <b>the</b> <b>base</b> year level), {{while others have}} limitations above <b>the</b> <b>base</b> year level.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} rarangkéns or {{attachments}} for removing, modifying, or adding vowel or consonant sound to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> characters. 13 rarangkéns <b>based</b> on <b>the</b> position to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{can be categorized}} into three groups: (1) five rarangkéns above <b>the</b> <b>base</b> characters, (2) three rarangkéns below <b>the</b> <b>base</b> characters, and (3) five rarangkéns inline <b>the</b> <b>base</b> characters. In addition, there are glyphs for number characters, from zero to nine.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5|$|These guanine-rich {{sequences}} may stabilize chromosome ends {{by forming}} structures of stacked sets of four-base units, {{rather than the}} usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack {{on top of each}} other, to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ceciliae {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and Christopher Edmund Broome, a British mycologist, in 1854. It {{is placed in}} the genus Amanita and section Vaginatae. Section Vaginatae consists of mushrooms with special characteristics – such as the absence of a ring, and very few clamp connections at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of the basidia.|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} {{injection of}} carriers into <b>the</b> <b>base</b> allows <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{to have a}} higher doping level, resulting in lower resistance to access <b>the</b> <b>base</b> electrode. In <b>the</b> more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is primarily determined by the doping ratio between <b>the</b> emitter and <b>base,</b> which means <b>the</b> <b>base</b> must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in <b>the</b> <b>base</b> can improve figures of merit like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 March the Regional Forces {{defending}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> abandoned their positions and by afternoon <b>the</b> <b>base</b> was under attack by Vietcong who were held back by <b>the</b> <b>base</b> security forces. With more Vietcong gathering for renewed attacks <b>the</b> <b>base</b> commander contacted <b>the</b> 92nd Air Wing at Phan Rang AB for help. The Wing commander, Colonel Le Van Thao organised a flight of 40 A-37s and they carried out a night attack on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> perimeter successfully breaking up the attack. On {{the morning of}} 31 March, the 2nd Air Division evacuated <b>the</b> <b>base</b> taking 32 aircraft, but abandoning a further 50; the PAVN/Vietcong occupied <b>the</b> <b>base</b> that afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|In common usage in {{elementary}} geometry, cones {{are assumed to}} be right circular, where circular means that <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is a circle and right means that the axis passes through the centre of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> at right angles to its plane. If <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is right circular the intersection of a plane with this surface is a conic section. In general, however, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> may be any shape and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is bounded and therefore has finite area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of <b>the</b> <b>base).</b> Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the axis passes through the centre of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> non-perpendicularly.|$|R
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of basidia.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of their legs; {{both of these}} features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of protests {{regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> In July 1988 20,000 people made a human chain around <b>the</b> <b>base</b> to protest noisy night landings at <b>the</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
50|$|In an {{isosceles}} triangle that has exactly two equal sides, the equal sides are called {{legs and the}} third side is called <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> <b>The</b> angle included by the legs is called the vertex angle and the angles that have <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{as one of their}} sides are called <b>the</b> <b>base</b> angles. <b>The</b> vertex opposite <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is called <b>the</b> apex.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{reduplication}} {{can also}} involve copying the beginning or end of <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> In Quileute, <b>the</b> first consonant of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is copied and inserted {{after the first}} vowel of <b>the</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> and returns to home plate.|$|E
5|$|Born in Sylvan Lake, New York, {{he played}} {{organized}} baseball {{from the time}} that he was a child, from playing in the local sandlots to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls, New York. On July 7, , while running <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> he collided at home plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered a traumatic head injury, and later died from these injuries on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E
50|$|In {{the more}} {{realistic}} case of many products exchanged between many countries, {{terms of trade}} can be calculated using a Laspeyres index. In this case, a nation's terms of trade is {{the ratio of the}} Laspeyre price index of exports to the Laspeyre price index of imports. The Laspeyre export index is the current value of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period exports divided by <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period value of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period exports. Similarly, the Laspeyres import index is the current value of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period imports divided by <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period value of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> period imports.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Base</b> is a {{regional}} shopping centre located in Te Rapa, in the New Zealand city of Hamilton.

50|$|The 601st CSG {{assumed the}} new wing’s {{secondary}} mission of operating <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and of performing <b>the</b> <b>base</b> support functions {{except for the}} brief two-year period (1973-75) when <b>the</b> 7400th Air <b>Base</b> Group ran <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> until 1 June 1985.|$|R
5|$|Colón {{scored on}} a hit by Escobar. The Royals loaded <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> and Cain drove home three more runs with a double off of Bartolo Colón. Davis pitched a shutout inning for the Royals to {{complete}} the series and win the championship. He struck out Flores looking to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 30-year World Series title drought.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 1991 <b>Base</b> Realignment and Closure Commission {{recommended}} closing <b>the</b> <b>base</b> as {{its operating}} costs were too high; <b>the</b> <b>base</b> closed in 1993.|$|R
