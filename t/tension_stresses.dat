When this shell is at a low moisture content it will 'set' and resist shrinkage. The core of the wood is still at a higher moisture content. This core will then begin to dry and shrink. However, any shrinkage is resisted by the already 'set' shell. This leads to reversed stresses; compression stresses on the shell and <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> in the core. This results in unrelieved stress called case hardening. Case-hardened wood may warp considerably and dangerously when the stress is released by sawing.|$|E

Only a few studies are about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during <b>tensioning</b> process. The theoretical model of roll tensioning process was established by Szymani. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> [1]. The model of roll tensioning process was established by Nicoletti based on finite element method and the <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll tensioning of circular saw blades which allowed the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during multi-spot pressure tensioning process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during multi-spot pressure tensioning process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1903-05, {{the firm}} {{designed}} {{the first nine}} Packard Automotive Plant buildings using traditional wooden designs that had spans no longer than 14 ft. Packard produced over 700 automobiles a year by 1905, so an expansion to the factory facility was in order. The team decided to use reinforced concrete to build the new factory space. With Albert's younger brother Julius as the key architect and engineer, Building Number 10 was constructed with the Kahn bar and other reinforced concrete products. These were manufactured at the Trussed Concrete Steel Company (aka [...] "Truscon"), which provided 32 ft spans. This new technology for concrete changed the way American automobile factories were built. This building was built with uniquely designed steel beam reinforced concrete for reinforcement that used the Kahn bar with winged tabs on the steel bar edges that were bent back at 45 degrees to resist and counter <b>tension</b> <b>stresses.</b> This {{was the first time}} reinforced concrete was used for automobile factory construction in the United States. The new state of the art design concept featured larger open interior spaces than the old mill-framed wooden factory buildings. The building was 322 feet long by 60 feet wide (about 98 meters by 18 meters). This new factory concept of building with reinforced concrete lead to Albert Kahn Associates doing all the aviation factories for the government during World War I.|$|E

Hybrid composite cable contains three layers: carbon fiber composite cable (CFCC) core, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) and steel wire strands. CFCC core and steel wire strands take up <b>tension</b> <b>stresses,</b> acting in the cable during the exploitation. The functions of GFRP are distribution of transversal pressure of steel wire strands at the carbon fiber core, and taking up of <b>tension</b> <b>stresses.</b> Volume fractions {{of steel and}} carbon are determined basing on the assumption, that in an emergency, when the strain of carbon fiber exceeds the ultimate value and these fibers are disrupted, strands of steel wire must be able to take up <b>tension</b> <b>stresses,</b> acting in the cable.

30|$|For casing design process, {{there are}} three types of loads that the {{designer}} needs to consider: collapse, burst, and tension. Collapse and burst loading are often the dominating stresses at a depth closer to the bottom hole, {{so at this point}} in the well the casings should be selected according to collapse and burst resistance. With a decreasing depth, the effect of collapse also decreases while burst and <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> become more critical. As a consequence, the criteria for design of the casing at the middle portion of the well are tension and burst stresses. As for the casing near the surface, <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> would be the most important factor that should be considered (Bourgoyne et al. 1986).|$|E

The analysis indicates that geocell’s <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> is affected strongly by width, height, tension modulus, compression modulus of geocell and Poisson ratio, elastic modulus of foundation. Of these factors, geocell’s height is the great one. And meanwhile, {{the influence of the}} ratio of geocell’s tension to compression modulus to geocell’s <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> is researched. From the analysis, we find that the geocell’s <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> greatly changes with the change of the ratio.

30|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> {{distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This {{distribution of}} tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is not very ideal relatively. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

Mechanical computations are carried out with the finite element code CAST 3 M developed at the French Atomic Energy Agency (CEA). Heat gradient and water vapour pressure inside the concrete element are determined by using a thermo-hydrous model. Then, the mechanical stresses generated in the studied concrete element are calculated according to two behaviour assumptions: the linear isotropic elastic law and an elastoplastic model. Numerical simulations show that, during the heating cycles, <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> are developed in the central part and compression stresses at the surface of the cylindrical concrete element.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{different}} causes of cracks {{on the surface of}} asphalt pavements. The primary cause of cracking in asphalt layer is increasing <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> and related strains to the point when the tensile strength of the material is exceeded. Semi–circular shaped cracks occur {{at the edges of the}} excavations and pavements where there is poor local sub–layers, thin layer of asphalt and excessive traffic loads. Semi–circular shaped cracks are very common. However, they are often confused with the netlike cracks. The typical form occurs when the crack progresses to a certain point of contact to the outside edge of the pavement, whereas in the opposite direction (inside) of the track it provides adequate resistance against the occurrence of crack. Cracks spread in the direction of poor sub–base and are formed gradually one next to the other or independently. This paper presents semi–circular shaped cracks with a single, double or several free edge. Semi–circular shaped cracks propagated from top to bottom at the cross section. The analysis of numerical model shows that the line deflection and maximum tensile stresses on the toper surface are in a semi–circular, which indicates the formation of semi–circular shaped cracks. To determine the location of cracks it is necessary to look at the maximum <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> σij on the top surface of the model. The location of crack is somewhere in the area of maximum <b>tension</b> <b>stresses</b> and occur when the tensile strength of the material is exceeded...|$|E

30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of circular saw blade for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of circular saw blade [3 – 5]. However, circular saw blade can also obtain radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during roll <b>tensioning</b> process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin circular saw blade requires higher tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> and lower radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll tensioning process of thin circular saw blade.|$|R
