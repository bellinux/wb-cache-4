The presence of accounting ratios in annual reports would enhance the understandability and analytical concerns of the financial statements.

However, <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> accounting ratios in an annual report among listed companies in Bursa Malaysia were found to be relatively low in Malaysia.

To indicate the usefulness of accounting ratios to the investors, the volatility of share prices are measured (by means of standard deviation) which represent the level of trading activities took place during the announcement period. These volatilities of share prices are then analysed to find its correlation with the level of accounting ratios disclosed by the companies in their annual reports. Samples are collected from 50 companies listed in Bursa Malaysia during 2008 and 2009.

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} shed more light on how {{businesses}} {{have used the}} language of sustainability in their <b>disclosures.</b> <b>The</b> study employs interpretive textual analysis and takes {{a closer look at}} how the corporate talk of sustainability has developed in <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> three major Finnish companies during the period 1987 - 2005. In-depth understanding is sought by limiting <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> from four anchor points only. The findings indicate major changes in the ways the case corporations have used sustainability-related concepts over the two decades. Over time sustainability seems to have transformed from a possibly revolutionary concept into an evolutionary one, if not to one merely concerned with sustaining of the status quo. Moreover, whereas in <b>the</b> early <b>disclosures</b> <b>the</b> conceptualisation <b>of</b> sustainability appears to be rather polyphonic, in more recent years the companies use fairly similar rhetoric drawing on the discourse of weak sustainability. As a longitudinal study the paper makes a contribution to the still relatively limited body of research deconstructing corporate social and environmental disclosures from an interpretive standpoint. However, the study focuses only on <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> three case companies in one particular country, and thus the generalisation of the findings must be approached with caution. ...|$|R

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration before and after introduction of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2001, the changes in accounting standards FRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ in 2005 and FRS 124 ‘Related party disclosure’ in 2006 and the changes to the Bursa Malaysia Listing Rule. The study seeks to examine the effectiveness of these reforms in improving <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. The second objective is to fill the gaps in prior study by empirically testing the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration based on agency theory, legitimacy theory, signaling theory and proprietary costs. These theories are represented by several ownership variables, corporate governance variables and firm characteristics. Using an un-weighted disclosure index, this study scored <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration of 200 publicly listed Malaysian companies over the period of 2000 to 2008. The period captured the revolving nature of the Malaysian regulatory framework on <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. <b>The</b> <b>disclosure</b> index is based on prior studies and the regulatory framework. The dataset is in the form of a panel data and consisted of 1788 company-years. The study employed non-parametric tests and multivariate analysis to examine any significant changes in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration and the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that there were significant improvements in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration after the reforms. However, Malaysian companies appeared to take advantage of weaknesses in the reforms to fall back on the practice of disclosing minimum of the mandatory requirements. A significant number of Malaysian companies continued not to disclose on their individual executive directors’ remuneration. The inconsistencies between the mandatory Listing Rule and the voluntary MCCG made it easier for companies not to do so. These implied that the ‘hybrid’ approach adopted by the regulators in implementing in the reforms was not sufficient in ensuring comprehensive <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. Hypothesis tests on the determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration found that traditional dominance by family shareholders was significant and limit <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. Other agency players (regulators, foreign investors and creditors) roles appeared to be dwarfed by the presence of controlling family shareholders. However, government shareholdings alleviated to a certain extent, this dominance by significantly pushing for compliance with the reforms. Corporate governance mechanisms of independent directors and level of audit quality were shown to work differently in different disclosure environments in improving <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> executive directors’ remuneration. The findings also supported the notions of legitimacy theory and signaling theory that company size, industry differences and profitability were significantly associated with <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> This study also showed that contrary to expectations of proprietary costs, companies with higher growth were more likely to disclose the remuneration of individual executive directors.
