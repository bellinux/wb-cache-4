From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds drug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E

Its healthcare system is ranked {{higher than that of}} the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP. Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population.

40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} the rural-urban differences in expenditures of outpatient care, hospital inpatient care, {{hospital emergency room}} services, medications, and total services. Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The overall sample size for the study was 22, 772. Weighted frequencies, means, or percentages were estimated to illustrate the distribution of each variable. Five two-part utilization models were then fit to determine the likelihood of having nonzero expenses and to identify how residence in a rural versus urban area affected expenditures in our five expense categories. Quantile regressions were estimated to further explore relationships between residence and each quantile of nonzero expenditure. Results. The results of two-part model suggest that rural populations spent more on medications, while urban populations spent more on emergency care. However, no rural-urban difference was found in <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The results of quantile regressions suggest that the highest users (at the upper quantiles) of medication and total expenditure experienced the strongest positive effects of living in rural areas. Conclusions. <b>Total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{do not seem to}} vary significantly across urban and rural areas. However, rurality does have important effects on those who make the most use of outpatient care and prescription medications. Reviewing <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> for urban and rural populations is not enough.

40|$|This paper differs in {{two ways}} from {{previous}} comparative health system research. First, it focuses {{on the impact of}} pharmaceutical <b>expenditures</b> on <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> as trends in pharmaceutical expenditures have been blamed of being a major driver of national <b>health</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In addition to pharmaceutical expenditures, other variables of interest are income, public financing, public delivery, ageing and urbanization. Second, the analysis includes a thorough sensitivity analysis on the proposed model using four samples (with and without the US, and imputed and not imputed data) {{to address the issue of}} robustness. Based on a typology of health care systems, trends of relevant explanatory variables are described using OECD Health Data 2003 data. Unlike any other of the variables, pharmaceutical expenditures show contradicting trends when measured as per capita pharmaceutical expenditures and pharmaceutical share of <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Next, a regression analysis is performed on data from 1970 – 2000 for 19 OECD countries. Regression diagnostics indicated the absence of multicollinearity but the presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Based on the Hausman test, a fixed effect model was chosen. As in all previous empirical research, per capita GDP turned out to be the most influential explanatory variable. While public financing of health care was always three out of four samples significantly inversely related to <b>health</b> <b>expenditures,</b> public delivery as a NHS dummy was always significantly positively related to the dependent variable. Unlike previous research, ageing is consistently and significantly related to higher <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditures</b> and, so is urbanization.

Indonesia’s mental health legislation has the same issues mentioned above that Southeast Asia faces as a region. The legislation is far from what can be considered complete and fair, and the articles included are not well practised and reinforced. In 1966, Indonesia was well ahead of {{other countries in the}} region by having a mental health law separated from general health laws, providing potentials for expansion of the mental health system. However, the law was repealed in 1993 and integrated into general health laws. Mental health now only occupies four articles in the current health law. The articles are too general, causing difficulties to apply and implement. Article 26 states that almost anybody can request treatment and hospitalisation for persons with mental disorder, yet has no mention of the person's consent. By doing so, Article 26 creates an impression that mentally ill individuals are generally considered dangerous to the community because they need to be forced into treatment. This goes along with the negative stigmas associated with mental disorders mentioned above and elaborated later in this paper. Also, Article 27 states that the government will provide a presidential decree for regulations and management of mental health, yet nothing has been done.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Gradual <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> (THE) {{has become}} a major concern. It is not only the {{increased}} THE, but also its unequal growth in overall economy, found among the developing countries. If increased life expectancy is considered as a leverage for an individual’s investment in health services, it can be expected that as the life expectancy increases, tendency of health care investment will also experience a boost up. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore and identify the association of healthcare expenditure with the life expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries, especially that of Bangladesh. Methodology: Data were retrospectively collected from “Health Bulletin 2011 ” and “Sample Vital Registration System 2010 ” of Bangladesh considering the fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 2006. Using STATA, multivariable logistic regression was performed to find out the association of <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> with GDP and life expectancy. Results: A direct relationship between GDP and <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> was found through analysing the data. At the individual level, income had a direct influence on health spending. However, there was no significant relationship between <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> with increased life expectancy. Conclusion: The present study did not find any association between life expectancy and <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure.</b> However, our analysis found out that <b>total</b> <b>health</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more sensitive to gross domestic product rather than life expectancy.
