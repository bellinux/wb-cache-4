25|$|Dialogue {{journals}} {{have been}} studied {{by a number of}} researchers for their value in developing students' critical thinking by providing opportunities for students to practice self-reflective awareness and to critique classroom practices, teaching assignments, and social contexts, in both first and second language acquisition settings. Practice with critical thinking in exploring their own worlds and the worlds of others, with the words that they have at their disposal, results in students experiencing personal empowerment and expressing a personal voice—the unique expression of the self <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> hearing that particular person speak in their writing.|$|E
25|$|Selecting a {{different}} test usually identifies {{a different}} list of significant genes since each test operates under a {{specific set of}} assumptions, and places a different emphasis on certain features in the data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a sensible starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. Some tests consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine learning or Monte Carlo methods.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Colbert, portraying his {{character}} Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're {{not talking about}} truth, we're talking about something <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen." ...|$|E
500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow for Vulture {{scored the}} episode four stars out of five, saying {{it makes the}} season's stakes clear by being an origin story for both Ghost Rider and Morrow, and praising the series for {{focusing}} on those elements {{rather than trying to}} closely tie-in with Doctor Strange as it did in previous seasons. Meslow also said that Gabe Reyes was [...] "a welcome addition, successfully recognizing and calling out anything <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> bullshit." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick at ScreenCrush said the episode was easily the best of the season so far, though he was still [...] "on the fence as to whether Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the clearest sense of where Season 4 is going". Fitzpatrick noted that Lucy had [...] "inarguably [...] the weakest element" [...] of the season and was not surprised with the Morrow reveal, and questioned the series' stance on the morality of the Ghost Rider, feeling that it should have been made more clear. He added that the episode [...] "seemed to position itself a bit better with regard to coming episodes".|$|E

In April 2011, she {{appeared}} in a commercial for the American Red Cross asking people to pledge $10 to help those affected by the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. In the same year Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the first Annual Global Action Awards Gala for her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children in schools, and her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated: [...] "I want (kids) to do something they love. Not something <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a chore because someone tells them that's {{the right thing to}} do or what their parents want or what's important to people around them, but what's in their heart." [...] In December 2011, {{she appeared in}} a commercial for the charity J/P Haitian Relief Organization, and teamed up with her elder brother Trace Cyrus to design a limited edition T-shirt and hoodie for charity. All proceeds from the sale of these items went to her charity, Get Ur Good On, which supports education for under-privileged children. In the same month, she performed her song [...] "The Climb" [...] at the CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{journalist}} Peter Bradshaw {{felt that}} Contagion blended well {{together as a}} film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and [...] "the massive sense of loss" [...] of [...] "ordinary people". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the [...] "brilliant" [...] film was [...] "serious, precise, frightening," [...] and [...] "emotionally enveloping". Despite applauding Soderbergh for [...] "hopscotching" [...] tidily [...] "between the intimate and international", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and [...] "clinical" [...] disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson [...] "beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'." [...] "For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is," [...] professed The Atlantic writer. Described as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images {{of men and women}} isolated in the frame, in the blurred {{point of view of the}} dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an exhortation to look." [...] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the [...] "crisp" [...] and succinct narrative matched up to the [...] "beautifully composed" [...] visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the [...] "shrewd" [...] and [...] "unsensationalistic" [...] film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo [...] "weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the [...] "self-consciousness" [...] and [...] "experimentation" [...] of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).|$|E

Commenting on this change, an article in Wired says: [...] "the Palladinos had written the majority of the episodes up to that point, and their distinctive rhythms and obsessions were what defined Gilmore Girls.

Mitchell spoke to the Los Angeles Times in 2010 about Morgellons, saying, [...] "I have this weird, incurable disease <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> it's from outer space, but my health's the best it's been in a while." [...] She said at that time that she planned to leave the music industry to work toward giving more credibility to people diagnosed with Morgellons.|$|E
2500|$|Eudora Welty {{suggests}} that Eggleston sees {{the complexity and}} beauty of the mundane world: [...] "The extraordinary, compelling, honest, beautiful and unsparing photographs all {{have to do with}} the quality of our lives in the ongoing world: they succeed in showing us the grain of the present, like the cross-section of a tree.... They focus on the mundane world. But no subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!" [...] Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: [...] " [...] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger." [...] American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston's work, [...] "When you see a picture he’s taken, you’re stepping into some kind of jagged world <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> Eggleston World.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E
