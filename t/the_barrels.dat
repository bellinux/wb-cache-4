5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

50|$|The MG 3 has a quick-change, chrome-lined barrel {{with four}} {{right-hand}} grooves and a rifling twist rate of 1 in 305 mm (1:12 in). Alternatively, MG 3 barrels {{can also have}} polygonal rifling. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> is integrated with <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> breech. During sustained firing, {{there is a need}} for <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> to be changed and this is how they are swapped: The gun is cocked and <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> catch on <b>the</b> right of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> shroud is swung forward. Then, the breech end of <b>the</b> hot <b>barrel</b> swings out and can be removed by elevating or twisting the gun.

5|$|Documentation {{indicated}} that the missing uranium {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E

5000|$|A {{free-floating}} barrel is one {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and stock are designed to not touch at any point along <b>the</b> <b>barrel's</b> length. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> is attached to its receiver, which is attached to the stock, but <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> [...] "floats freely" [...] without any contact with other gun parts, other than the rifle's sights. This minimizes the variance in possible mechanical pressure distortions of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> alignment, and allows vibration to occur at the natural frequency consistently and uniform shot-by-shot.|$|R

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow {{on the rim of}} the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign of the superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone.

50|$|To load this weapon {{the hammer}} is cocked. As the hammer rotates on its axis pin, it acts upon the trigger, and the sear snaps into the cocking notch, holding the hammer. The hammer axis pin also {{supports}} the center arm of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> holding lever, which arm emerges and is raised high enough by its spring to press {{into a slot}} under <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> <b>The</b> rising thumbpiece on top of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> over <b>the</b> breech is then pushed forward. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> moves forward until its muzzle emerges from <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> housing, compressing <b>the</b> recoil spring. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> holding lever is snapped into the locking notch in the underside of <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> thereby holding it in forward position for charging {{as shown in the}} drawing from Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947, page 189.|$|R

50|$|The Hi-Power, {{like many}} other Browning designs, {{operates}} on the short-recoil principle, where <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and slide initially recoil together until <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is unlocked from the slide by a cam arrangement. Unlike Browning's earlier Colt M1911 pistol, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is not moved vertically by a toggling link, but instead by a hardened bar which crosses the frame under <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and contacts a slot under the chamber, at the rearmost part of <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> and slide recoil together for a short distance but, as the slot engages the bar, the chamber and the rear of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> are drawn downward and stopped. The downward movement of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> disengages it from the slide, which continues rearward, extracting the spent case from the chamber and ejecting it while also re-cocking the hammer. After the slide reaches the limit of its travel, the recoil spring brings it forward again, stripping a new round from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. This also pushes <b>the</b> chamber and <b>barrel</b> forward. <b>The</b> cam slot and bar move the chamber upward and the locking lugs on <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> re-engage those in the slide.|$|R

5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> from their path.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked {{to ensure that the}} breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> holding {{lever arm}} moves up by {{action of the}} trigger, and catches <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> in forward position. The {{magazine}} spring, pushing against the follower, forces the cartridges up to present the next cartridge for loading. As the trigger is released and moves forward it acts on the bottom arm of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> holding lever causing it to pivot and its forward upper arm to release <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> is then driven back by the recoil spring to load the next cartridge.|$|R
25|$|Mark I gun's recoil {{system was}} in two tubes above <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> {{and used a}} {{hydraulic}} buffer with a hydro-spring recuperator to return <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> to its firing position; Mark II gun had a hydro-pneumatic system below <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> motor <b>barrel,</b> <b>the</b> {{functions}} of <b>the</b> arbor and <b>barrel</b> were reversed from <b>the</b> going <b>barrel.</b> <b>The</b> mainspring was wound by <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> and turned <b>the</b> arbor {{to drive the}} wheel train. Thus if the mainspring broke, the destructive recoil of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> would be applied not to the wheel train but to the winding mechanism, which was robust enough to take it.|$|R
5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm {{tank gun}} began in 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm gun (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date, and the tank's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120mm gun. The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The gun, known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> to fracture and fatigue. Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall's gun produced under licence include Japan's Type 90 and South Korea's K1A1. The gun had made a huge turn in technological history.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} {{to recover the}} shipment that {{had been sent to}} France. Documentation was discovered that said that part of it had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant James I, {{who became}} King of England in 1603, was less {{tolerant}} of Catholicism than his followers had hoped. Catesby therefore planned {{to kill him}} by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament, the prelude to a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy Fawkes. Described latterly as a charismatic and influential man, {{as well as a}} religious zealot, over the following months he helped to bring a further eight conspirators into the plot, whose naissance was planned for 5November 1605. A letter sent anonymously to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, alerted the authorities, and {{on the eve of the}} planned explosion, during a search of Parliament, Fawkes was found guarding <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.|$|E
50|$|To {{check for}} a good paint-to-barrel match, remove <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> from <b>the</b> marker and insert a paintball into <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> If <b>the</b> paintball simply rolls through <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> then <b>the</b> paintball is too small for that <b>barrel.</b> If <b>the</b> paintball does not roll out, then attempt to blow the paintball out of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> using your mouth.

50|$|The {{evacuator}} is {{a simple}} passive device. It consists of a ring of holes drilled into <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> surrounded by a cylindrical pressure reservoir. As the shell moves down <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> during firing, it creates a high pressure {{in front of the}} projectile and the evacuator is filled with high pressure air, it reaches a point where the base of the shell passes the set of holes. The high-pressure is then released through these holes. As the shell continues down <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>the</b> pressure begins to drop, and then suddenly returns to near atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> towards <b>the</b> front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extracting fumes from <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The K100 uses a rare locking system, {{similar in}} some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Brügger & Thomet MP9 which employs a {{rotating}} barrel lock, which in the K100's case is cammed by a cross pin. When the pistol is fired <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is cammed clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical [...] "cut" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extension. Once <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and slide have moved back to the point where <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> has twisted about 45°, the slide is free to continue traveling back while <b>the</b> <b>barrel's</b> travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extension's square shoulders. On the K100, <b>the</b> Beretta's <b>barrel</b> extension cam cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols.|$|R
5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
5|$|Phan's {{men were}} well-trained and disciplined, and the {{military}} inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from Cao Thang, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of Thanh Hóa in the north, Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An in the centre and Quảng Bình in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north {{in the hope of}} coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with umbrella spokes, and the lack of rifling in <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> which curtailed range and accuracy.|$|E
5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage.|$|E
50|$|The {{floating}} chamber {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When field stripping the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and <b>the</b> floating chamber must be aligned vertically to remove <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> from <b>the</b> slide. Once <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is removed, <b>the</b> floating chamber can be rotated and separated from <b>the</b> main <b>barrel</b> for cleaning.
