5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural attractions, human involvement in the area is also responsible for making tourism {{a large part of}} the regional economy.

3000|$|Since {{nucleated}} islands {{acting as}} shadowing centers are essentially {{required for the}} formation of columnar structures in the initial period of the rotational GLAD, recently placing nano-sized <b>templates</b> on <b>the</b> bare substrate is proposed to replace the nucleated islands, in such a way both deposition period and deposition flux can be reduced significantly. Most importantly, by designing the geometry and the alignment of <b>the</b> <b>templates,</b> ordered arrays of columnar structures with pre-designed shapes can be fabricated under the intensified shadowing effect [12, 13]. Although the template-assisted rotational GLAD has been demonstrated to be one promising nanostructuring technique for the fabrication of 1 D nanostructures, our fundamental understanding of the deposition process, particularly the deposition-induced deformation of <b>the</b> <b>templates,</b> is still limited: will <b>the</b> <b>templates</b> deform during <b>the</b> deposition?

5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of <b>the</b> <b>template</b> strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads <b>the</b> <b>template</b> strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{considered}} to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. The eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game's de facto villain. The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. The ape kidnaps Mario's girlfriend, originally known as Lady, but later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that would provide <b>the</b> <b>template</b> for countless video games to come.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs.

While the game's elements had been present in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set <b>the</b> <b>template</b> for others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior {{changed the nature of}} video game development by making scenario writers far more important.|$|E
30|$|Hard {{templating}} is a conceptually {{straightforward and}} highly effective method to prepare hollow structures that mimic and/or complement the original shape of <b>the</b> <b>templates</b> [1, 2], which usually {{consists of the}} following steps: 1. Preparation of hard templates; 2. Functionalization/modification of template surface; 3. Coating <b>the</b> <b>templates</b> with <b>the</b> target shell material; and 4. Selective removal of <b>the</b> <b>templates</b> to obtain hollow structures. Silica particles and polymer latex colloids belong {{to the group of}} materials commonly employed as hard templates.|$|R

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in <b>the</b> <b>template</b> strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda is {{considered}} a spiritual forerunner of the modern role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it is often not {{considered part of the}} genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as <b>the</b> <b>template</b> for the action role-playing game genre. The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including Crystalis, Soul Blazer, Square's Seiken Densetsu series, Alundra, and Brave Fencer Musashi. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game.|$|E

In most of the above cases the minority treaties were only one of many articles of the aforementioned treaties.|$|E

In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise, and Gary Trousdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris Sanders, and Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, and many others.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that <b>the</b> <b>template</b> strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E

5|$|The rest of Constantine's 1928 {{tour was}} {{generally}} successful; {{only in the}} three Test matches, the first played by the West Indies, was he less effective. Although he took the West Indies' first wicket in Test cricket, dismissing Charlie Hallows, and finished with innings figures of four for 82, he took only one more wicket during {{the remainder of the}} series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52.40; with the bat, he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14.83. Even so, Jack Hobbs said that Constantine's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced, Constantine believed his captain, Karl Nunes, over-bowled him; the pair did not get along well. When the tour ended, Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first-class games than any other tourist. He was second in the team's batting averages with 1,381 runs at 34.52, and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22.95. It was the manner in which Constantine played which set him apart from the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time: his style, aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds. According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine, he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established <b>the</b> <b>template</b> for West Indian cricketers for years to come.|$|E
