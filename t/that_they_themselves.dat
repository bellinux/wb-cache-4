Sweet shops or mahal al hilaweyat, {{can be found in}} the souks of cities and major towns, they offer a wide range of sweets common with Palestinians, such as, kanafeh, baklawa and anise-flavored cookies. Family-run shops often serve at least one type of sweet <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> created. The city of Nablus in particular are world famous for their exquisite Arabic sweets, and have some of the oldest sweet shops in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> hold.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> have no natural predators. They are {{sometimes}} called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E

Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped {{and surrounded by}} bone matrix <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> produced.

25|$|Caregiver {{sensitivity}} {{has also}} {{been found to have}} a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children {{have been found to be}} more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy in a situation where someone else is distressed.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Planetarium hypothesis, it is {{theorized that}} our {{perceived}} reality is a simulation created by more intelligent beings. The creators of this hypothetical simulation may have purposely excluded life {{other than what}} has been found on Earth, or have simply not introduced it to humans in the simulation yet. It is also possible <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> are more intelligent humans, who also have not {{come in contact with}} alien lifeforms.|$|E
25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add to happiness. This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.|$|E

25|$|The {{delay in}} {{fertility}} becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak. Since fertility peaks {{at a certain}} age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women {{will be able to}} have children. The media has been an influence on women's fertility choices: popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> will also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E
25|$|Pro-Jewish {{reforms were}} often not {{executed}} by local magistrates in the fragmented sultanate, however, {{and even if}} they were they reignited animosity toward the Jewish population. Thus, for example, the sultan Sulaiman (1795–1822) decreed that the Jews of Fez might wear shoes; but so many Jews were killed in the streets of that city {{as a result of the}} edict <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> asked the sultan to repeal it. According to a statistical report of the AIU, for the years 1864–80 no less than 307 Jews were murdered in the city and district of Morocco, which crimes, although brought to the attention of the magistracy upon every occasion, remained unpunished.|$|E

25|$|Puddefoot's {{exploits}} {{made him}} much sought after and Falkirk, who had witnessed the player first-hand, {{won the battle}} for his transfer on 7 February 1922. The fee of £5,000 was a world football transfer record, and represented the only time a Scottish team has broken the record. So eager were the Falkirk supporters to land their man <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> raised money for the purchase by setting up a public conscription. Puddefoot himself earned a £390 fee for agreeing the transfer. His younger brother Len followed him to Falkirk {{at the start of}} the following season for a month's trial, but only made a single appearance.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 1945, Mildura was refitted, then in March {{assigned}} to Morotai. The ship's main roles were to patrol {{the vicinity of the}} island, and to shepherd convoys between Morotai and Biak. On 22 June, the ship was sent to Borneo to provide nighttime patrols of Tarakan Harbour's approaches. She was reassigned back to Morotai at the end of June. During the return voyage, the ship diverted after spotting a crashed PBY Catalina on Makheli Island. A group of natives reported that the aircrew had been rescued by another aircraft, but requested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> be evacuated because they had come {{to the attention of the}} Japanese. The six natives were transported to Morotai.|$|E
25|$|Biopiracy {{describes}} a practice in which indigenous knowledge of nature, originating with indigenous peoples, {{is used by}} others for profit, without permission from and {{with little or no}} compensation or recognition to the indigenous people themselves. For example, when bioprospectors draw on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge is not new, or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> had developed. Critics of this practice, such as Greenpeace, claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in biodiversity, and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.|$|E

25|$|In those days, {{the nation}} of the Northumbrians had violently {{expelled}} from the kingdom the rightful king of their nation, Osbryht by name, and had placed {{at the head of}} the kingdom a certain tyrant, named Alla. When the pagans came upon the kingdom, the dissension was allayed by divine counsel and the aid of the nobles. King Osbryht and Alla, having united their forces and formed an army, came to the city of York; on their approach the multitude of the shipmen immediately took flight. The Christians, perceiving their flight and terror, found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> were the stronger party. They fought upon each side with much ferocity, and both kings fell. The rest who escaped made peace with the Danes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{users of}} such systems {{generally}} pay to use vehicles <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> do not own, sharing systems differ from traditional for-profit bike rental businesses. The first bike sharing projects were largely initiated by local community organisations, either as charitable projects {{intended for the}} disadvantaged, or to promote bicycles as a non-polluting form of transport. In recent years, {{in an effort to}} reduce losses from theft and vandalism, many bike-sharing schemes now require a user to provide a monetary deposit or other security, or to become a paid subscriber. Most large-scale urban bike sharing programmes utilise numerous bike check-out stations, and operate much like public transit systems, catering to tourists and visitors as well as local residents. Some bike-sharing systems are completely free like Aarhus in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the story}} also take place in London, the capital of Britain. In this timeline, the British people are impoverished due to the German occupation; William Shakespeare and his works are more widely known and {{published}} in Germany than in Shakespeare's homeland, partly due to Britain's economic collapse. During the Second World War, much of London was destroyed by dive bombers and panzers as well as during the last-ditch resistance by Churchill and his supporters. Key British buildings including the Parliament building, Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral have been completely destroyed, with their only remaining legacy being photographs. Some {{areas of the city}} have been in ruins for over seventy years, due to harsh reparations imposed on the British by the Germans and partisan uprisings that would only be completely crushed by 1970. German city planners often visit Britain to see how their colleagues deal with building from the clean slate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>themselves</b> can never have.|$|E
