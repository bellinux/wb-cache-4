Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on <b>the</b> <b>detector.</b> The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E

5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by <b>the</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E

Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia.

Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>detector</b> contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted.

25|$|Not all {{gamma rays}} emitted by the source that pass through <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> {{will produce a}} count in the system.

In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.|$|E

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> {{should only be}} exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards <b>the</b> <b>detector,</b> ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source.

25|$|The {{energy of}} the gamma rays being {{detected}} {{is an important factor}} in the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>detector.</b> An efficiency curve can be obtained by plotting the efficiency at various energies.

High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors typically have higher sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency, like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for <b>the</b> <b>detector.</b> Absolute efficiency values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>detector</b> at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm).
