Unfortunately, Pollock was too ill to leave the hospital and succumbed to his illness the next evening on December 10, 1992. [...] "I've been thinking of death a lot, and I am amazed by its inevitability, frightened, as we all are, of the totally unknown, and yet feel a long sleep is somehow earned by <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on the edge." [...] The last known photograph of Jack Pollock was taken shortly before his passing in 1992 at the Kinsman Robinson Galleries (Norval Morrisseau's principal dealer since 1989) beside a Morrisseau painting. As Pollock himself had predicted in 1984, he is still mostly recognized for his association with Norval Morrisseau.|$|E

He then spent {{hundreds}} of hours at the place he named “Dream Street,” producing 12,891 photos, 47½ hours of recordings, three bankers’ boxes of notes, maps and e-mails” and ultimately a book. The 134-home, 40-acre subdivision is a microcosm of the new economy, a site where issues of race and gender, immigration and exploitation, hopes and dreams animate a classic California landscape. Susan Brenneman, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Dream Street “a classic tale, recast for Southern California: the American dream, tied to the almighty dollar and abundant cheap labor, dependent, equally, on self-deception and inextinguishable hope.” “For <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on one of California’s streets of dreams,” writes author D.J.

5000|$|An infamous anarcho-primitivist is Theodore Kaczynski, {{also known}} as the Unabomber who engaged in a {{nationwide}} mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern [...] "industrial-technological system". The manifesto begins thus: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.|$|E

These {{children}} are being trained for the ultimate purposes of deriving personal delight from the art and giving it to others. If the music they study gives them no pleasure, if they miss intimacy with the composer's idea—then {{it is so much}} wasted time. If you demand, as {{you have a right to}} demand, the right kind of music for them, you will get it. Publishers are in business to supply what you most need, but your needs must be known to them. Children have a good deal of latent romance and poetic insight, and music can bring this out and develop it with magical swiftness. By feeding every poetic tendency, often very personal and original, you will be building up, in each of them, a love for beauty which will never leave them. That would be great work, for what else is this life-quest in which we are all engaged? Do we get a fraction of the delight in living that we feel we are justly entitled to? <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on, bearing the inevitable blows of sorrow, can turn to music and other forms of Beauty and find in them the secret compensations of the Creator.

5000|$|The Michigan Civil Rights Commission later reiterated {{this belief}} in a 138-page report titled [...] "The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint". Its writers said of it, [...] "Policy makers, {{government}} leaders, and decision makers at many levels failed the residents of Flint," [...] said Agustin Arbulu, Director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. [...] "By not challenging their assumptions, by not asking themselves the tough questions about how policy and decisions play out in different communities, especially communities primarily made up of people of color, those decisions and actions - or in some cases, lack of action - led to the tragedy taking place in Flint." [...] "We strongly believe that the actions {{that led to the}} poisoning of Flint's water and the slow response resulted in the abridgement of civil rights for the people of Flint," [...] said Arthur Horwitz, co-chair of the Commission {{during the time of the}} investigation. [...] "We are not suggesting that those making decisions related to this crisis were racists, or meant to treat Flint any differently because it is a community of color. Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them. We hope this report is a step in that direction." [...] The Governor's office responded: [...] "Some findings of the report and the recommendations are similar to those of the (Flint Water Advisory Task Force and) the legislative panel and the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee," [...] said Gov. Rick Snyder spokeswoman Anna Heaton. [...] "The Governor takes the reporting of each of these panels very seriously, and appreciates the public input that was shared." [...] The findings were no surprise for State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich. [...] "The presence of racial bias in the Flint water crisis isn't much of a surprise to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> here, but the Michigan Civil Rights Commission's affirmation that the emergency manager law disproportionately hurts communities of color is an important reminder of just how bad the policy is. Now is the time to address this flawed law," [...] Ananich said. He went on to say, [...] "The people of Flint deserve the same level of safety, opportunity and justice that any other city in Michigan enjoys".|$|E

40|$|The {{lives of}} people with disabilities are disconcerting, as we do not sit well within the health system and yet are an {{integral}} part of that system. Our lives and our realities are shaped by the system and yet we know the experience of being an alien ‘other ’ within that system. The experiences {{of people with disabilities}} provide valuable insight into how to reform the health care system. Through addressing the values and attitudes that lead to not all people being treated as equal, a health care system can be built that is better able to meet the diverse needs of all who use it. A couple of years ago I was involved in convening a workshop of consumers with disabilities for the Safety and Quality Council’s work shaping an Open Disclosure standard. That workshop of people with a diverse range of disabilities identified one overwhelming reality—just about every admission to hospital constitutes an adverse event for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> with disability.

If those effects are as positive as the fundraising literature of such agencies tends to suggest, then there would be a very strong case for saying that we should give to them.
