50|$|A battery’s ability <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>charge</b> is {{dependent}} on its energy density and power density. It is important that charge can remain stored and that a maximum amount of charge can be stored within a battery. Cycling and volume expansion are also important considerations as well. While other many types of batteries exist, current battery technology is based on lithium-ion intercalation technology for its high power and energy densities, long cycle life and no memory effects. These characteristics have led lithium-ion batteries to be preferred over other battery types. To improve a battery technology, cycling ability and energy and power density must be maximized and volume expansion must be minimized.|$|E

30|$|Depending on {{different}} storage principles, supercapacitors {{can be divided}} into two categories: double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (or redox supercapacitors). The former relies on electrostatic charge storage at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, which are usually composed of carbon based materials. The latter class of supercapacitors is based on a fast and reversible redox reaction <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>charge</b> and is mostly prominent in transition metal oxides and conducting polymers [1, 5, 6]. To date, RuO 2 {{is believed to be the}} most outstanding material for high electrochemical performance. However, its high cost and toxicity restrict its large-scale industrial applications [7, 8]. Therefore, the exploration of inexpensive and eco-friendly transition metal oxides to replace RuO 2 for electrochemical energy storage applications is a topic of great debate.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a method <b>to</b> manipulate <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> density and polarity in anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) for silicon solar cell passivation. The method {{involves the use}} of a pulse current source to anodise aluminium layers instead of the typically used constant current/voltage source, with the test structures experiencing positive and negative cycles periodically. By tuning the positive cycle percentage, it is demonstrated that the effective <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> can be manipulated in a range from - 5. 2 × 1011 to 2. 5 × 1012 q/cm 2 when the AAO is formed over a thin silicon dioxide layer. Photoconductance decay measurements on symmetrical n-type test structures with ∼ 150 Ω/□ boron-diffused surfaces were used to estimate the recombination current density associated with the diffused surface (Jop+), which was then correlated <b>to</b> the <b>stored</b> <b>charge.</b> As the effective <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> changed from positive towards negative values, the Jop+ was reduced from 210 fA/cm 2 to 100 fA/cm 2.

Using carbide-derived carbon, we generated pores with average sizes from 0. 6 to 2. 25 nanometer and studied double-layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte. The results challenge the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are incapable of contributing to charge storage...|$|E
