5|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} a media tour of part of the set and an invitation-only screening sponsored by the publisher of MacGrath's book. The Carpet from Bagdad was released on 3 May 1915 to mostly positive reviews. Many praised the <b>tinted</b> desert scenes and realistic Middle East imagery, although some felt the scenery overshadowed the characters. The film is now mostly lost, although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.|$|E
5|$|De Stem des Bloeds (The Voice of Blood), {{also known}} as Njai Siti, is a 1930 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). It was {{directed}} by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows {{a man and his}} mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was <b>tinted</b> different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.|$|E

5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand <b>tinted.</b> Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably <b>tinted</b> with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{photocatalyst}} <b>TiNT</b> itself, {{performance of}} immobilized <b>TiNT</b> was relatively lower. This might happen because of fewer contact between <b>TiNT</b> catalyst and phenol pollutant for the immobilized catalyst case, compared to catalyst in slurry condition. On the performance test, immobilized <b>TiNT</b> were only {{concentrated on the}} top part of test solution, due to floating ability of pumice. On the other hand, for the performance test of <b>TiNT,</b> the condition was slurry, where contact frequency between catalyst and pollutant was relatively high.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears <b>tinted</b> glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement.

The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is <b>tinted</b> in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.|$|E
30|$|<b>TiNTs</b> were {{synthesised}} by hydrothermal treatment. The {{details of}} the synthesis method of <b>TiNTs</b> are described elsewhere [30]. A thin PDA layer was created {{onto the surface of}} <b>TiNTs</b> by oxidative polymerisation of dopamine-hydrochloride. This procedure involves mixing of 800  ml of <b>TiNT</b> suspension (2  mg/ml) with 1.6  g of dopamine-hydrochloride dissolved in 5  g of TRIS buffer adjusted to pH[*]=[*] 8.5. The PDA coating on <b>TiNTs</b> was carried out for 3.5  h at 25  °C. After coating, the pH was adjusted to 6.4 using 35 wt.% HCl. The suspension was purified using dialysis tubing cellulose membrane and the resulting PDA-functionalised <b>TiNTs</b> (PDA-TiNTs) were isolated using freeze drying.|$|R

5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly <b>tinted</b> in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand <b>tinted</b> version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|In an August 3, 1973, {{memo to the}} Atari {{engineering}} department, co-founder Nolan Bushnell {{laid out}} plans {{for the company to}} create a prototype 20-player version of Gotcha in time for a trade show later that year, though no such game was ever made. Instead, released {{at the same time as}} Gotcha and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a <b>tinted</b> color overlay, and a true multi-color version of Gotcha with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E

30|$|Compared to the FE-SEM {{image of}} <b>TiNT</b> (Fig.  1 b), the immobilized <b>TiNT</b> (Fig.  6 c–f) {{apparently}} has shorter and wider tube, with diameter of 40 – 70  nm. The increase in size (diameter) of <b>TiNT</b> might happen {{due to the}} sintering effect [32, 39] occured on the second calcination experienced by the immobilized <b>TiNT</b> on pumice. Sintering effect {{could be described as}} a phenomenon where the anatase crystallites fused together, forming a relatively larger structure [32]. Before the immobilization step, <b>TiNT</b> had firstly calcined at high temperature to get the crystalline form of titania. On this step, the formation of crystallite phase occurred without accompanied by the sintering process, hence <b>TiNT</b> produced was thin and separated perfectly. Therefore, the tube diameter would also become larger because the tube should adapt to the growth of the anatase crystallite. Qamar et al. [32] get similar phenomenon for <b>TiNT</b> which is calcined at rather high temperature (700  °C).|$|R
5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having <b>tinted</b> leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, <b>tinted</b> with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were <b>tinted</b> blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E
40|$|Among those {{individuals}} who habitually wear precision <b>tints,</b> reading speed can vary {{as a function of}} the chromaticity of the illuminating light. The reading speed decreases as the chromaticity departs from optimum, whether in saturation or in hue. When the distance in the CIE 1976 UCS diagram between the chromaticity of the illuminating light and that optimal for reading exceeds about 0. 08, the colour has little residual benefit. We attempt to answer two questions numerically: (1) how is reading speed affected by the variation in the colour provided by the <b>tint</b> under different lighting conditions? (2) how many different <b>tints</b> does an ophthalmic <b>tinting</b> system need to be able to provide? Analysis of 1000 recent prescriptions suggests that, for most, the variation in colour with illumination is sufficient to reduce, but not eliminate, the beneficial effects of the <b>tints.</b> The number of trial <b>tints</b> required by an ophthalmic <b>tinting</b> system is a power function of the degree of efficacy desired, and for an average efficacy> 95 % of optimum, the number of trial <b>tints</b> needs to exceed 1000. In practice this requirement can readily be achieved by combining trial lenses and by appropriate dyeing techniques...|$|R
50|$|Monochromatic {{colors are}} all the colors (<b>tints,</b> tones, and shades) of a single hue.
