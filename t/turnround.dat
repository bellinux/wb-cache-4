In 1875, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, landed at the pier and the opportunity was taken to rename the harbour facility Prince's Pier. The station itself was renamed at the same time. In 1894 the station was relocated {{a little to the}} north-west, closer to the steamer berths, and providing more lavish facilities, and with six italianate towers.|$|R
40|$|Meeting {{the demand}} for faster <b>turnrounds</b> and shorter print runs goes beyond making the {{printing}} press easier {{to set up and}} change. There is little point in producing plates and then sheets from a press if the post press area does not change to keep abreast of developments in prepress and the print room. The greatest impact is going to come from JDF, the end to end production data format which is finding wide spread acceptance in print areas. To date finishing equipment manufacturers are not as well represented within the CIP 4 organisation as prepress and press vendors, but the major manufacturers are members. All are working to the goal of complete connectivity. The idea of JDF is that if the format of a print product like a magazine is known during the creation phases, the information can be used to preset machinery {{that is going to be}} used to produce it, so avoiding input errors and saving manufacturing time. A second aspect to JDF is that information about performance and progress is gathered and can be retrieved from a central point or made available to a customer. Production scheduling and costing becomes more accurate and customer relationships are deepened. However JDF to its fullest extent is not yet in use in connecting the finishing area to the rest of the printing plant. Around the world different companies are testing the idea of JDF to connect saddle stitchers, guillotines and binders with frantic work underway to be able to show results soon. </p...|$|R

He came on as a substitute after an hour, with Newport 2-0 up, and converted a penalty in the 86th minute. In stoppage time, the <b>turnround</b> was complete when he scored twice more, in the 94th and 96th minutes, to seal a 3-2 win. He was Kidderminster's top scorer for 2011-12, with 15 goals from 43 Conference matches, and turned down the offer of a new contract.|$|E

5000|$|Hoverlloyd {{commenced}} operations from Ramsgate Harbour to Calais Harbour on 6 April 1966 using small, passenger only SR.N6 hovercraft. When {{the much}} larger SR.N4 craft, capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 254 passengers, were delivered in 1969, Hoverlloyd moved operations to a purpose built ‘hoverport’ in Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate. A similar facility was provided east of Calais harbour and was shared with Seaspeed (who operated into Dover on the UK side of the English Channel). Crossing ('flight') times were as low as 22 minutes. [...] Hovercraft operations were prone to disruption and cancellation during bad weather, although this was eased over time by various modifications to the craft, a typical problem being damage to the rubber 'skirt'. Also, the hovercraft had an unmatched <b>turnround</b> time, {{with the ability to}} disembark/embark cars {{at both ends of the}} craft, whilst simultaneously dealing with foot passengers from two main exits on the port and starboard cabins.|$|E
5000|$|The Arab League {{meeting in}} Cairo {{yesterday}} was unprecedented in its overture to Israel, offering to meet Israeli representatives {{to clarify the}} peace initiative that the League re-endorsed at its meeting in Riyadh on March 28. The two events underscore the complete reversal of the paradigm that for so long has defined the Israeli-Arab conflict.... The Israeli response to this tectonic change in Arab psychology and politics was worse than rejection: it was complete indifference, as if this 180-degree <b>turnround</b> in Arab thinking had no meaning for Israel and its future in the region. Ehud Olmert, prime minister, and his government have reflexively rejected every Arab peace offer, whether from Saudi Arabia, Syria, the Arab League or Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Ariel Sharons and Mr Olmerts policies these past seven years have shaped a new paradigm in which Israel is the rejectionist party. The Three Nos of Khartoum {{have been replaced by}} the Three Nos of Jerusalem: no negotiations with Syria, no acceptance of the Arab initiative and, above all, no peace talks with the Palestinians.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 5 October 1863 by the Kent Coast Railway (KCR). The KCR was {{operated}} by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which absorbed the KCR on 1 July 1871, and the station was renamed Birchington-on-Sea by the LCDR in October 1878. From the start of 1899, the LCDR's services were {{operated by the}} newly formed South Eastern and Chatham Railway, which the LCDR co-owned with the South Eastern Railway (SER). At the start of 1923, the LCDR amalgamated with other railways (including the SER) to form the Southern Railway. A small goods yard was situated on the Up London bound side of the station which closed in the 1970s and operated by the signalbox located midway on the down platform closed {{about the same time}} during a resignalling programme. The wire and rod cutout can still be seen within the brick face of the down platform. The 2007 Budget plan of Network Rail allows for the removal of the remaining manual <b>turnround</b> and it is believed short residual siding occasionally used for storing tamping track maintenance units, 'tampers'.A junction existed {{to the west of the}} station to serve RAF Manston until the 1930s operated from a Ground Frame Birchington B located some 440 yd upside of the station - a plan of which can be seen in the RAF Manston Museum.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{specimen}} <b>turnround</b> time audit, directly controlled by laboratory staff, {{was applied to}} a bacteriology service to assess service efficiency and identify delays and other deficiencies, so that resources could be optimised.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} current {{performance}} of the clinical biochemistry service provided to general practitioners, with particular attention to result <b>turnround</b> times, and to identify and improvements required. METHODS: Postal questionnaire survey of general practitioners in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets who used the clinical biochemistry laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. A flow analysis study of <b>turnround</b> times for general practitioner samples was also performed. RESULTS: Responses to the questionnaire showed that although 82 % of general practitioners thought the current quality of service provided was better than fair, the actual <b>turnround</b> times achieved were longer than the acceptable times required. There was also a strong demand (> 66 % of responders) for additional information-such as highlighting of abnormal results-to be provided with results. There was wide variability between practitioners {{in their use of}} the laboratory (from none to > 800 requests per year), with no apparent correlation to practice size. Of the repertoire of tests requested, a surprisingly high percentage (14. 3 %) were for thyroid function. Flow analysis of <b>turnround</b> times for thyroid function tests showed that problems lay not with the time taken for analysis (only 7. 8 % of the total <b>turnround</b> time) but with the pre- and postanalytical phases, that is, the sample collection and results delivery service. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the proportion of health care delivered in the primary care sector will inevitably increase the requirement for pathology services. Improvements in the specimen collection and results delivery service to general practitioners are needed to meet their expectations. It remains to be determined whether increased investment in these aspects of laboratory service would result in improved patient care in the primary sector...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{institute}} {{recommendations from}} a laboratory <b>turnround</b> time study; to evaluate audit methods; and to quantify improvements achieved. METHODS [...] Changes to result report distribution and specimen delivery {{were affected by}} posting results directly from the laboratory followed {{by the introduction of}} a twice daily courier service. Improvements were evaluated by repeating the <b>turnround</b> time audit described in an earlier report. Pre-, peri- and post-analytical <b>turnround</b> times were compared before and after changes had been instituted. RESULTS [...] Directly posting general practitioner (GP) results increased the percentage of reports which reached their destination within one and two days after they were generated from 13 to 29 % and from 68 to 82 %, respectively. Pre- and postanalytical times were superimposable before and after posting was started. Corresponding improvements to the satellite hospital service were from 25 to 78 % and from 60 to 82 %, respectively. The courier service shortened the median total <b>turnround</b> time from 50 to nine hours for GPs and from 69 to 18 hours for the satellite hospital. Fifty three per cent of GP reports and 21 % of satellite hospital reports arrived on the same day as the sample was taken: 99 % and 94 %, respectively, had arrived by the next day. The number of analytically "old" samples which arrived the day after they had been taken, thus invalidating many results, fell from 25 to 3 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] These audits of laboratory <b>turnround</b> time have been used to present a valid case for changes to laboratory transport and to quantify the improvements achieved. They produce consistent and repeatable results, which may also be used to monitor future performance, to assess further changes and to establish the cost-effectiveness of resources used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This is a talk on {{interaction}} of the techniques of positivity and abstract convexity in functional analysis and the extremal problems of convex geometry. Alexandr Danilovich Alexandrov became the first and foremost Russian geome-ter of the twentieth century. He contributed to mathematics under the slogan: “Retreat to Euclid, ” remarking that “the pathos of contemporary mathematics is the return to Ancient Greece. ” Hermann Minkowski revolutionized the theory of numbers {{with the aid of}} the synthetic geometry of convex surfaces. The ideas and techniques of the geometry of numbers comprised the fundamentals of functional analysis which was created by Banach. The pioneering studies of Alexandrov con-tinued the efforts of Minkowski and enriched geometry with the methods of measure theory and functional analysis. Alexandrov accomplished the <b>turnround</b> to the an-cient synthetic geometry in a much deeper and subtler sense than it is generally acknowledged today. Geometry in the large reduces in no way to overcoming the lo-cal restrictions of differential geometry which bases upon the infinitesimal method...|$|E
40|$|Histopathology audit schemes have {{concentrated}} on the accuracy of diagnosis or the standard of technical work. The most appropriate measure of specimen report time for histopathology was assessed. The simplest method is to calculate the mean or median number of days from receipt of specimens to issue of report, but this takes no account of clinical practice. An alternative approach is to compare the laboratory's performance with the clinicians' requirements. Clinicians were invited to complete a questionnaire specifying the reporting times they required subdivided by tissue type, clinical suspicion of malignancy, and bed occupancy of the patient. The questionnaire showed that there were distinct differences in clinicians' requirements. The <b>turnround</b> time for each category of specimen was calculated and expressed in three ways. The traditional method of quoting a median value showed very few differences among the categories. A comparison of the department's performance with the clinicians' requirements, using an arbitrary cut-off point of satisfying at least 80 % of the clinicians' most stringent requirements or an achievement index, however, provided useful information for refining laboratory priorities...|$|E

40|$|With Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) as {{a generic}} concept of working {{together}} of all airport partners, the main aim of this research project was to increase {{the understanding of the}} Influences on the Target Off-Block Time (TOBT) Prediction Accuracy during A-CDM. Predicting the TOBT accurately is important, because all airport partners use it as a reference time for the departure of the flights after the aircraft turn-round. Understanding such influencing factors is therefore not only required for finding measures to counteract inaccurate TOBT predictions, but also for establishing a more efficient A-CDM turn-round process. The research method chosen comprises a number of steps. Firstly, within the framework of a Cognitive Work Analysis, the sub-processes as well as the information requirements during turn-round were analysed. Secondly, a survey approach aimed at finding and describing situations during turn-round that are critical for TOBT adherence was pursued. The problems identified here were then investigated in field observations at different airlines’ operation control rooms. Based on the findings from these previous steps, small-scale human-in-the-loop experiments were designed aimed at testing hypotheses about data/information availability that influence TOBT predictability. A turn-round monitoring tool was developed for the experiments. As a result of this project, the critical chain of turn-round events and the decisions necessary during all stages of the turn-round were identified. It was concluded that information required but not shared among participants can result in TOBT inaccuracy swings. In addition, TOBT predictability was shown to depend on the location of the TOBT turn-round controller who assigns the TOBT: More reliable TOBT predictions were observed when the turn-round controller was physically present at the aircraft. During the experiments, TOBT prediction could be improved by eight minutes, if available information was cooperatively shared ten minutes prior turn-round start between air crews and turn-round controller; TOBT prediction could be improved by 15 minutes, if additional information was provided by ramp agents five minutes after <b>turnround</b> start.
