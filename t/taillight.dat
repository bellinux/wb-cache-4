5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken <b>taillight</b> but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
25|$|A new egg-crate grille and <b>taillight</b> trim {{highlighted}} the 1972 Electra 225s. The trouble-prone ventilation system used in 1971 {{was replaced by}} a new system using vents in the doorjambs instead of the trunk-mounted vents of 1971.|$|E
25|$|US {{standards}} {{specify the}} height of the driver’s eye is defined as 1080mm (3.5ft) above the pavement, and {{the height of}} the object the driver needs to see as 600mm (2.0ft), which is equivalent to the <b>taillight</b> height of most passenger cars.|$|E
5000|$|Fluted <b>taillights</b> {{continuing}} the design pioneered on the W116, {{a design that}} helped maximise visibility of <b>taillights</b> from behind the car even when extremely dirty ...|$|R
50|$|The rear tail-lights are {{different}} than any the <b>taillights</b> of any other Bentley vehicle. The <b>taillights</b> are red-coloured glass and are in an oval shape, they protrude {{from the rear of}} the car and are full-LED <b>taillights,</b> and their shape is almost exactly the same shape as seen in the Speed Six's wide dual tailpipes.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1993 model year, the Crown Victoria {{was given}} a chrome front grille and a [...] strip between the <b>taillights.</b> Another minor restyle {{followed}} suit in 1995, with a new grille and <b>taillights.</b> To accommodate {{the design of the}} 1995's new <b>taillights,</b> the rear license plate was moved from the bumper to the trunk's lid.|$|R
25|$|A revised grille {{with fewer}} {{vertical}} bars and revised <b>taillight</b> lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included {{the addition of}} GM's High Energy electronic ignition and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.|$|E
25|$|In all markets {{the charge}} port is located behind {{a door in}} the left <b>taillight.</b> During charging, the charge port pulses green. The {{frequency}} at which the charge port's light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid green.|$|E
25|$|Only minor detail changes {{including}} grille and <b>taillight</b> revisions {{were made}} to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to , matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.|$|E
50|$|The {{metallic}} maroon Banshee III {{made its}} public debut in 1974. It had four slit style <b>taillights,</b> but these became twenty “high-tech, round-hole” <b>taillights</b> {{when it was}} updated in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{marker lights}} or {{blackout}} <b>taillights</b> are typically {{housed in the}} same unit as the vehicles <b>taillights,</b> and are the main tool in keeping the proper following distance in nighttime convoy driving.|$|R
5000|$|At the rear, ribbed {{rectangular}} <b>taillights</b> were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed {{marker lights}} of similar height were mounted at {{the trailing edge of}} each fender side. The deck lid had {{a slightly higher}} lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the <b>taillights</b> while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the <b>taillights.</b> Station wagons saw vertical wraparound <b>taillights</b> replacing the previous [...] "hooded" [...] units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.|$|R
25|$|The '68 Electra 225 got {{a revised}} grille and <b>taillight</b> trim along with {{concealed}} windshield wipers. Inside, {{there was a}} revised instrument panel with a square speedometer and other instruments, plus a new steering wheel. Shoulder seat-belts were standard for both the driver and front passenger. Base and Custom models were still offered, with the Limited trim option available on the Electra 225 Custom hardtop sedan.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamically, Shelby added a carbon-fiber {{up front}} diffuser, which is complemented {{in the rear}} by a larger carbon-fiber spoiler hanging off the trunk lid. Below the wing there’s more carbon fiber used in the new rear diffuser, <b>taillight</b> panel, and rocker panels with side-skirt aero blades {{just in front of}} the rear wheels. The {{composite}} is also in place for the mirror covers. Finally, there’s the requisite Super Snake racing stripes and external badging.|$|E
25|$|Only a minor {{facelift}} with revised grille and <b>taillight</b> trim {{marked the}} 1970 Electra 225. The big news {{was under the}} hood, where a new 370-horsepower 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and high compression engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the design}} {{changes on the}} Valiant models, the Duster also {{received}} a new hood, grille, front fenders, bumpers, and <b>taillights</b> for 1973. The <b>taillights</b> on previous years mounted from the inside and had a flush appearance. Starting in 1973, the <b>taillights</b> were mounted from the outside and were trimmed in chrome. These remained unchanged through 1976. The Dodge version, the Demon, was rebranded [...] "Dart Sport" [...] in response to church groups opposition to the word, [...] "Demon." ...|$|R
2500|$|All overall {{dimensions}} of the 1971 Toronado were larger than previous models with wheelbase increased from 119 to , only [...] less than the full-sized Delta 88. Also, the subframe design of first-generation Toronados {{was replaced by a}} separate body-on-frame similar to full-sized Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The front torsion bar suspension was retained, but the multi-leaf springs in the rear were replaced by coil springs. In addition, the Toronado introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted <b>taillights</b> above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Riviera. These <b>taillights</b> mirrored brake and turn functions of the normal <b>taillights,</b> but not the nighttime <b>taillights.</b> A rear-wheel ABS became optional.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes to}} headlights, bumpers and <b>taillights.</b>|$|R
25|$|Only {{minor changes}} {{including}} new grille and rear <b>taillight</b> patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre {{aside from the}} top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 Grand Prix {{received}} only minor appearance revisions from the 1965 edition {{including a new}} more rounded split grille and new <b>taillight</b> trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either Morrokide or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a notchback bench seat with center armrest was a no-cost option.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 models {{received}} a revised grille and <b>taillight</b> trim and six-window styling on four-door models. The dashboard, radio and climate control graphics were revised; the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year {{along with its}} full-size B-body counterparts including the Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick LeSabre, and Pontiac Grand Ville. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.|$|E

50|$|At {{the rear}} {{there was less}} change, {{although}} the car received restyled <b>taillights.</b> Set in heavy chromed housings, they were mounted to the carryover quarter panels and imparted a Dodge familial appearance to the rear, as one of Dodge's styling hallmarks of the time was round <b>taillights.</b>|$|R

25|$|The SS {{was now a}} trim option {{limited to}} the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black <b>taillight</b> bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
25|$|Up front, all 1958 Oldsmobiles {{received}} one of General Motors' heavily styled front fascias and quad-headlights. Streaking {{back from the}} edge of the headlights was a broad belt consisting of two strips of chrome on regular 88s, three strips on Super 88s, and three strips (top and bottom thin, inside thick) on 98s that ended in a point at mid-body. The bottom of the rear fender featured a thick stamping of a half tube that pointed forward, atop which was a chrome assembly of four horizontal chrome speed-lines that terminated into a vertical bar. The tail of the car featured massive vertical chrome <b>taillight</b> housings. Two chrome stars were fitted to the trunklid.|$|E
25|$|Z29 - Spyder {{equipment}} package : BR70-13C steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires (with {{option for}} raised white lettering), sport suspension, black {{front and rear}} bumper rub strips, black headlights frames, black windshield, belt, side and rear window moldings (not available with black exterior), black painted body sill (also not available with black exterior), black door and center pillar louvers, black painted <b>taillight</b> frames, body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems on front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel (horn button insert), black sport mirrors (LH remote, RH manual), rear spoiler and body stripes with Spyder lettering outlined in accent body colour, Spyder hood decal, black painted Rally II wheels with bright trim rings and center caps.|$|E
50|$|For 1961, the Meteor was a {{full-sized}} model, differentiated {{from the}} Monterey through its trim and <b>taillights.</b> Meteor 600 <b>taillights</b> were oblong, while the Meteor 800 and upmarket Monterey used six circular tail lights, three on each side. Meteor 600s, available only as two- and four-door sedans, featured chrome spears from the <b>taillights</b> {{to the front}} wheels. Meteor 800s, available in two- and four-door sedan and hardtop body styles, featured the spear and three chrome bars on the front fenders, chrome fender fin trim, rocker panel trim and back-up lights.|$|R
50|$|All overall {{dimensions}} of the 1971 Toronado were larger than previous models with wheelbase increased from 119 to 122 in, only 2 in less than the full-sized Delta 88. Also, the subframe design of first-generation Toronados {{was replaced by a}} separate body-on-frame similar to full-sized Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The front torsion bar suspension was retained, but the multi-leaf springs in the rear were replaced by coil springs. In addition, the Toronado introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted <b>taillights</b> above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Riviera.

25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. <b>Taillight</b> and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.|$|E
25|$|Three {{models of}} the 1930s were the Peugeot 202, Peugeot 302, and Peugeot 402. These cars had curvaceous bodies, with {{headlights}} behind sloping grille bars, evidently inspired by the Chrysler Airflow. The 2.1-liter 402 entered production in 1935 and was produced {{until the end of}} 1941, despite France's occupation by the Nazis. For 1936, the new Airflow-inspired 302 (which ran until 1938) and a 402-based large model, designed by Andrean, featured a vertical fin and bumper, with the first high-mounted <b>taillight.</b> The entry-level 202 was built in series from 1938 to 1942, and about 20 more examples were built from existing stocks of supplies in February 1945. The 202 lifted Peugeot's sales in 1939 to 52,796, just behind Citroën. Regular production began again in mid-1946, and lasted into 1949.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 Nova was {{basically}} a carryover from 1969. The side marker and <b>taillight</b> lenses for the 1970 Nova were wider and positioned slightly differently. This was the final year for the SS396 (actually, a 402 cubic in. engine now). All other engines were carried over including the seldom-ordered four-cylinder which was in its final year. The car finally became simply the Chevrolet Nova this year {{after two years of}} transitional nameplates (Chevy II Nova in 1968 and Chevrolet Chevy Nova in 1969). Out of 254,242 Novas sold for 1970, 19,558 were the SS 350 or SS 396 version. Approximately 177 Central Office Production Order (COPO) Novas were ordered, with 175 converted by Yenko Chevrolet. The other two were sold in Canada. The Nova was used in Trans-Am racing this year.|$|E
