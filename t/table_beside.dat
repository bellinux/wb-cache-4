5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
25|$|The café {{was very}} small, with the tables very close together, and was {{particularly}} busy that day, with many people {{waiting for the}} next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia, who were at a <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his scalp and knocking him to the floor. He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with no incident, {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E
5000|$|In Estonian, {{the ending}} -l {{is added to}} the genitive case, e.g. laud (table) - laual (on the <b>table).</b> <b>Besides</b> the meaning [...] "on", this case is also used to {{indicate}} ownership. For example, [...] "mehel on auto" [...] means [...] "the man owns a car".|$|R
60|$|After {{waiting a}} few minutes, {{the company of}} {{passengers}} took their seats at the <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> the plates for the guests, there was a row of dishes extending {{up and down the}} middle of the table, containing apples, pears, oranges, nuts, raisins, little cakes, and bon-bons of various kinds. There were also in this row two vases containing flowers.|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} data were analysed using descriptive, inferential and econometric tools. The descriptive statistics which {{were used for}} analysing {{data for this study}} include mean, standard deviation, percentages and <b>tables.</b> <b>Besides,</b> t test and chi-square test were used to test whether there is a statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (invaded and non-invaded households) in terms of continuous and categorical variables, respectively.|$|R
500|$|After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at Menton on the French Riviera, Kruger {{moved back}} to Hilversum, then {{returned}} to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he {{spent the rest of}} his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. [...] "He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past", he wrote in his final letter, addressed {{to the people of the}} Transvaal. [...] "Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again." [...] After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E

[...] John replied with various rebuffs including 'don't bother, don't bother'.|$|E
2500|$|The Darnley Portrait {{features}} a crown and sceptre on a <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> the queen, {{and was the}} first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as props (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits. [...] Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of red lake pigments, which has also altered the coloring of her dress.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that in the early}} times of the republic they were used as a mnemonic tool and a framework by the decemviri in the drafting of the XII <b>Tables.</b> <b>Besides</b> they acted as an intermediary stage between the mores and the XII Tables, answering the requirements of a society that was no longer satisfied with the revelations of the Pontifex Maximus.|$|R

But cuisine is eclectic here, and rice and beans sit on southern <b>tables</b> <b>beside</b> Italian and German dishes, thanks to the South's many European immigrants. Colonial coffee is the elaborate 5PM tea, with breads, pies, and German kuchen, popular among the Germans in the South.|$|R

In a ballad recited by a woman, it is told that [...] "His was the wizard hand that toil'd / At midnight's witching hour / That gather'd the sheep from the coming storm", and all he required were [...] "scattered sheafs" [...] and [...] "cream-bowl" [...] left on the meal <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> herding animals as just mentioned, reaping and threshing may {{be added to the}} list of chores he performs.|$|R
30|$|The {{third and}} final step, {{describing}} visions, brings the vision or visions into life: a manuscript is created for each vision, based on the vision paths sketched in the futures <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> written reporting, useful approaches to describe and explain a vision include visual illustrations, time lines, short stories and mind maps. Six relevant themes {{in the context of}} transport systems to be covered are 1) society as whole, 2) energy system, 3) transport system, 4) transport system technologies and services, 5) transport safety and security and 6) transport and environment.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{data from}} the four minor {{irrigation}} censuses conducted by the Ministry of Water Resources between 1986 - 87 and 2006 - 07, this paper points out that India's groundwater sector has slowed down since 2000 - 01, most markedly in eastern India. It examines {{the reasons for this}} and also looks into how farmers have been responding to lowered groundwater <b>tables.</b> <b>Besides</b> identifying some factors that have not changed since the mid- 1980 s, it emphasises that there are wide regional variations in the country's groundwater economy and management strategies need to be crafted accordingly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{definition}} of question classification based on question focus. Multi-focus questions {{are defined as}} questions containing multiple foci. It {{would be better to}} present their answers in a <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> defining the focus degree, relations between question foci are also discussed. A multi-focus question can be decomposed into several subquestions. The characteristics of the subquestions determine the representation of the final answers. Several simulation experiments have been carried out to verify the importance of focus analysis for multi-focus questions in a QA system.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a Web-based distributed system called TREESTORE, intended for storing compressed XML documents in a relational database. The use of a database is fully portable, requiring minimal changes to application code to substitute one database management system for another. In TREESTORE, compressed XML documents are shredded into a fixed number of relational <b>tables.</b> <b>Besides</b> the storage capability, TREESTORE provides online querying of compressed XML documents without requiring full decompression. Therefore, it is a useful component of any Web application as it combines space-efficient, database-portable access to persistent storage with online querying...|$|R

30|$|A {{backup system}} is not {{provided}} within this system. Regular backup operation on database {{is supposed to be}} provided by the administrator separately. The advantage is that this system stores all necessary information such as synchronization tables and multimedia objects within the same database as particular Moodle database, thereby making it easier for the administrator to focus upon database backup instead of additional file system backup. In the case that Master LMS crashed, the Slave will consider as a new course has been in place. In order to avoid such condition, backup procedure should be taking care of synchronization <b>tables</b> <b>beside</b> of the current Moodle database.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} featsel, {{a framework}} for benchmarking of feature selection algorithms and cost functions. This framework allows the user {{to deal with the}} search space as a Boolean lattice and has its core coded in C++ for computational efficiency purposes. Moreover, featsel includes Perl scripts to add new algorithms and/or cost functions, generate random instances, plot graphs and organize results into <b>tables.</b> <b>Besides,</b> this framework already comes with dozens of algorithms and cost functions for benchmarking experiments. We also provide illustrative examples, in which featsel outperforms the popular Weka workbench in feature selection procedures on data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository...|$|R
