5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands Olympic {{delegation}} included five athletes, competing only in athletics, swimming, and weightlifting. Among {{them were}} freestyle swimmer Giordan Harris, the lone returning Olympian from London 2012, and weightlifter Mathlynn Sasser (women's 58 kg), {{who led the}} contingent as <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands flag bearer in the opening ceremony. <b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands made their Olympic debut in weightlifting and had one of their largest Olympic delegations, matching their size in 2008. The delegation, however, failed to win their first-ever Olympic medal.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategic}} importance of <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls</b> had {{been recognized as}} early as 1921 in Plan Orange, an American interwar plan for a possible conflict with Japan. <b>The</b> <b>Marshalls</b> were a key step in the island-hopping march to the Japanese mainland.|$|R

50|$|George <b>Marshall</b> {{fought in}} <b>the</b> Civil War. He was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, {{returned}} home, and paid {{someone else to}} fight on in his place. During the War on January 8, 1865, eleven Union soldiers broke into Lansdowne to rob <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls.</b> They did not get much because the butler, Robert, had hidden <b>the</b> <b>Marshall's</b> silver under <b>the</b> floor of the mansion. In frustration the soldiers took {{a few pieces of}} <b>the</b> <b>Marshall's</b> fine china and smashed it along the road as they left.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands created its National Olympic Committee in 2001 {{and gained}} International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{recognition}} at their February 9, 2006 meeting.

50|$|With the new year, 1953, Patapsco resumed {{gasoline}} {{shuttle service}} to Midway and <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls.</b> On 6 August she sailed west again, {{this time to}} the Philippines, whence she carried aviation gasoline to Saigon, returning to Pearl Harbor 7 December.

5|$|Marshall Islands {{president}} Amata Kabua declared nine islands as disaster areas. United States president George H. W. Bush also declared <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands {{a disaster}} area on December16. Despite being an independent nation, <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands were eligible {{to the same}} funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a U.S. state or territory. The United States provided a loan of $508,245 (1994USD) for emergency assistance and to train locals to mitigate future events. After the storm, workers near Majuro planted seeds to regrow the damaged crops.|$|E

50|$|Germany annexed <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls</b> in 1885 {{but did not}} put {{government}} officials on the islands until 1906, leaving island affairs {{to a group of}} powerful German trading companies. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Japan took over after World War I. They colonised <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls</b> extensively, developing and fortifying large bases on many of the islands.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|No {{deaths were}} {{reported}} in association with Ekeka. The storm passed through <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands without causing significant impact. When Ekeka hit the island of Chuuk, winds of 20mph (32km/h) were reported.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands National Olympic Committee gained International Olympic Committee {{recognition}} in 2006 during the IOC's meeting on February 9, 2006. The admittance of <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands, along with Montenegro (who participated as Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Summer Olympics) and Tuvalu the following year, brought {{the total number}} of nations competing in the 2008 Olympics to 205.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshalls,</b> by contrast, were a {{much easier}} landing. The Americans used {{the lessons learned}} at Tarawa by outnumbering the enemy {{defenders}} nearly 6 to 1 with heavier firepower (including use of armor-piercing shells) after the islands took nearly a month of heavy air and naval bombardment. In <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls,</b> <b>the</b> Americans lost 611 men, suffered 2,341 wounded, and 260 missing, while the Japanese lost over 11,000 men and had 358 captured.|$|R
50|$|During {{the night}} Cha-Ka steals the lighter and limps {{off to find}} his fellow Pakuni. <b>The</b> <b>Marshalls</b> {{secretly}} follow him, but are threatened by the two elder Pakuni, Ta and Sa.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands are a Micronesian island nation, {{located in}} the western Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia. As of 2016 the nation had a {{population}} of approximately 53,000. The islands were under Spain's influence until their annexation by Germany in 1885. Japan occupied the Islands during World War I and formally annexed {{them as part of}} its postwar South Pacific Mandate. <b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands were placed under United States control in 1944. The islands granted independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's third {{consecutive}} {{appearance at the}} Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshall</b> Islands were {{represented}} by one male and one female athlete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in swimming: Giordan Harris and Ann-Marie Hepler. This {{was the first}} Olympic appearance for both Harris and Hepler.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marshalls</b> {{consist of}} 29 atolls and five {{isolated}} islands, which form two parallel groups—the [...] "Ratak" [...] (sunrise) chain and the [...] "Ralik" [...] (sunset) chain. <b>The</b> <b>Marshalls</b> share maritime boundaries with Micronesia and Kiribati. Two-thirds of the nation's population lives in Majuro and Ebeye. The outer islands are sparsely populated {{due to lack}} of employment opportunities and economic development.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} Solomon Islands and New Guinea to the Allies in 1943, the Japanese command decided that <b>the</b> Gilbert and <b>Marshall</b> Islands were expendable. They {{preferred}} fighting a decisive battle closer to home. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls</b> were reinforced {{at the end}} of 1943 to make their capture more costly for the Americans. By January 1944, the regional commander in Truk, Admiral Masashi Kobayashi, had 28,000 troops to defend <b>the</b> <b>Marshalls,</b> although he had very few aircraft.|$|R
