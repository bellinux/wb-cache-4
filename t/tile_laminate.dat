Lorberbaum held a number of leadership positions, eventually serving as Vice President of Operations from 1986 to 1994. [...] In 1994, Aladdin merged with Mohawk Industries, which had gone public in 1992, creating one of the largest flooring manufacturers in the United States - and his father became Mohawk’s largest shareholder. Jeffrey and Alan Lorberbaum then joined Mohawk's Board of Directors. In 1995, Lorberbaum became president of Mohawk; and, in 2001, he became CEO. Since then he has grown the company to $5.8 billion in revenues (2012) partly through acquisitions that expanded the scope of the company into hard surface flooring (ceramic <b>tile,</b> <b>laminate,</b> hard wood) and provided access to new geographies.In 2002, Lorberbaum orchestrated the $1.8 billion purchase of Dal-Tile of Dallas making Mohawk the world’s largest tile-maker. In 2005, Mohawk purchased Unilin, a Belgium-based maker of laminate flooring and MDF board (a composite used in do-it-yourself furniture) for $2.6 billion.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and useful {{evidence}} types found at the crime scene. Blood can indicate the number of suspects involved, the weapon used, the series of events, and can be used to generate DNA profiles. However, in some circumstances it can be difficult to identify blood on various substrates. Additionally other substances (such as paint and foodstuff) can be mistaken for blood. Current presumptive and confirmatory tests for blood used in forensic science (such as Luminol and Crystalline tests) have certain disadvantages including false positives and invasive testing. Raman spectroscopy is a method of non-invasive, confirmatory testing for blood and (with the recent development of handheld spectrometers) confirmation of blood at the crime scene is now possible The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of ageing and substrate variation on the Raman spectrum of Equine blood. The main focus will be on the possible effects on the main peak intensities corresponding to blood. This paper will also discuss the reliability of Raman spectroscopy to identify blood in conditions to those similar to the crime scene environment. Through analysis of spectra collected using Raman spectroscopy it was possible to demonstrate that the main peaks corresponding to blood undergo changes in intensity over time. The general change was an increase in intensity over time which did not correspond to the expectations of the study. However, decreases in intensity were seen at peaks 1587 cm- 1 and 1640 cm- 1 over time which did correspond to the expectations of the study and did correspond to haemoglobin degradation. Additionally, using Raman spectroscopy it was possible to demonstrate that the main peaks corresponding to blood undergo peak intensity fluctuations across various substrates. Initially, peak intensities varied greatly with each other and then decreased over time. The most significant decrease in intensity was seen at peaks 1587 cm- 1 and 1640 cm- 1 which correspond to haemoglobin degradation. Bought Equine (horse) blood was deposited on 6 substrates used for analysis: crystalline silicon (standard), a condom, brown leather, a ceramic <b>tile,</b> <b>laminate</b> flooring and blue denim. These substrates were chosen to represent similar substrates which blood may come into contact with at the crime scene. 3 droplets on each substrate were then analysed via Raman spectroscopy over a period of three months at time periods of: ≤ 1 hr, 2 hrs, 5 hrs, 24 hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month (28 days), 2 months (56 days) and 3 months (84 days). This research combines both ageing and substrate studies where previous research has only analysed the two separately. This research will also provide evidence for the use of Raman spectroscopy in a forensic context, specifically, when analysing blood at different stages of ageing and on different substrates...|$|E

40|$|Ballistic {{penetration}} {{experiments have}} been performed on ceramic <b>tiles</b> <b>laminated</b> with thin layers of polymer in between. The experiment involves shooting a cylindrical rod made of a tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) against an unconfined ceramic/polymer laminated structure that is backed by a 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy cylindrical-block, at a velocity ranging between 1000 to 1200 m/s. The residual depth of penetration in the aluminum block {{is used as a}} measure of the resistance offered by the laminated ceramic/polymer structure to ballistic penetration. Penetration resistance of the laminated ceramic/polymer structures is compared to that of monolithic ceramic structures of the same total thickness. Experimental results demonstrate that penetration resistance of an unconfined ceramic structure can be improved significantly by <b>laminating</b> ceramic <b>tiles</b> with thin polymer layers in between. This enhanced performance of the laminated structure is attributed to a reduced wave propagation (and damage) velocity in the laminated ceramic/polymer structure and also to the crack arresting feature of the polymer layer...|$|R

Additionally, immunolabeling can be used to (re) develop fingermarks. To be of interest in the forensic field, the applicability of immunolabeling should be highly diverse. Therefore, in this study we investigated the applicability of one such method: immunolabeling of fingermarks left on non-porous (aluminum foil, stainless steel keys, plastic sheets, different colored garbage bags, sandwich bags, Ziploc bags), semi-porous (<b>tiles,</b> <b>laminated</b> chipboard), and porous surfaces (thermal and copy paper). Successful immunolabeling of specific components in fingermarks was possible on all surfaces tested, except for laminated chipboards and copy paper. Additionally, high quality images could be obtained from the immunolabeled fingermarks. Surprisingly, fingermarks left on thermal paper showed improved visibility when developed with the immunolabeling method. In conclusion, one intrinsically similar immunolabeling method can visualize fingermarks left on non-porous, semi-porous and porous surface...|$|R

The first step in the process is the flooring, which is built in sections, each attached to a permanent chassis with its own wheels and secured for transport upon the home’s completion. Depending {{on the size of the}} house and the floorplan’s layout, there may be two, three or even four sections. The flooring sections have heating, electrical and plumbing connections pre-installed before they are finished with <b>laminate,</b> <b>tile</b> or hardwood. Next, the walls are constructed on a flat level surface with insulation and interior Sheetrock before being lifted by crane into position and secured to the floor sections. The interior ceilings and roof struts are next, vapor sealed and secured to each section’s wall frame before being shingled. Then, the exterior siding is added, along with the installation of doors and windows. Finally, interior finishing, such as sealing the drywall, is completed, along with fixture installation and finishing the electrical and plumbing connections. The exposed portions of each section, where they will eventually be joined together, are wrapped in plastic to protect them for transport.|$|R

Previous work has extensively investigated fingermark and blood enhancement techniques and a sequence developed to maximise evidence recovery; however, there is limited research as {{to the effect of}} these techniques on the subsequent detection of body fluids such as semen. In this study, seven fingermark and blood enhancement techniques (e. g. powder suspension, cyanoacrylate fuming and acid violet 17) were employed followed by the subsequent detection of semen/spermatozoa.
