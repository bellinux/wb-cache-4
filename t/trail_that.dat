5|$|Northwest of Reed City, US10 {{meets the}} US131 freeway before curving around {{the north side}} of town. The highway passes to the south of Nartron Field near the {{intersection}} with Bus. US10. The highway crosses the White Pine Trail State Park, a rail <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> runs north through the area. US10 continues east around {{the north side of}} town and runs parallel to the Pere Marquette State Trail, an east–west rail <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> follows the Ludington Division of the Pere Marquette Railway. The highway intersects the business loop {{on the east side of}} town and exits Reed City. US10 continues east and northeasterly though rural fields in Osceola County. The highway passes to the north of Evart Municipal Airport and enters the city of Evart. It runs along 7th Street through downtown before and crossing the Muskegon River and exiting the city. The trunkline runs parallel to the rail trail through rural country side to north of the small community of Sears before turning to the southeast.

5|$|Part of CR112 was {{originally}} {{part of an}} old Indian <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> went from Johnstown to Hamilton County via Bleecker. At some point, part of the trail {{in the vicinity of}} Bleecker was converted into a plank road that served several locations and churches north of Bleecker. Meanwhile, NY309 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a connector highway between the city of Gloversville and the hamlet of Bleecker.|$|E
5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} {{had to use}} an incline railway car to access {{the house at the}} top where people could dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway.|$|E

5|$|A {{neighborhood}} variously called East Hackensack or New Hackensack {{was established}} along a ridge {{on the east}} bank of the Hackensack River, site of a Native American <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> followed the river's path along what is now River Road, with the earliest known buildings constructed dating {{back as far as}} 1704.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward {{migration}} into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. As a result, there was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the telegraph had resulted in a <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> could be followed for interstate travel, {{but it was a}} haphazard route which only the more adventurous motorists would take. Many travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services; they would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism. In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see the road as important enough for its involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} K-383 {{southwest}} of Almena {{was part of}} the Rock Island Highway, an auto <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> paralleled the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad northeast from Colby to Norton and then east along the northern tier of the state to St. Joseph, Missouri. When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926, the Rock Island Highway, which had become integrated into the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway, was designated US-36. The portion of K-383 north of the US-36 split was K-22. By 1927, all of the highway along the K-383 corridor followed section lines, with a great number of right-angle turns, except for a small section south of Almena. US-36 and K-22 were graded throughout Norton County but were unimproved dirt roads in Decatur, Phillips, and Sheridan counties.|$|E

5|$|US131 and its {{predecessors}} bears several memorial designations {{in addition to}} the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.|$|E

For the next four years Igloo White and Commando Hunt would be interlinked in the anti-infiltration effort.|$|E
5|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The French-Indian Trail ran through southeastern Michigan between Toledo, Monroe and Detroit. The Saginaw Trail ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it {{connected with the}} original Mackinaw <b>Trail</b> <b>that</b> ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, {{an extension of the}} Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.|$|E
