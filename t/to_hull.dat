5|$|Wilberforce's staunchly Church of England {{mother and}} grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist {{influences}} {{and at his}} leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken {{to be separated from}} his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life, but as his religious fervour diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended balls and played cards.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City for £200,000 (at {{the time a}} Hull record). This move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the money they {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, and lost his job in the summer following a run of just one win in twelve games.|$|E

In 1897, she moved into the {{settlement}} house and lived there until 1924. At that time, she lived in the home of Mary Rozet Smith, where she remained until around 1934. Smith returned <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> House as a resident until she retired in 1936, and was succeeded by her sister, Gertrude. For health reasons, at that time, Smith moved to Midland, Michigan, where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30, 1942 in Midland. She was buried in Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The two Football League {{clubs are}} Bristol City and Bristol Roversthe former {{being the only}} club from the city {{to play in the}} {{precursor}} to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Bristol Manor Farm, Hengrove Athletic and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then sank to the bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.|$|E
5|$|With eight {{confirmed}} aerial victories {{during the}} war, including five over Norway, Hull was the RAF's first Gladiator ace {{and the most}} successful RAF pilot of the Norwegian Campaign. He was buried among fellow fighter pilots at Tangmere, and a monument to his memory was erected near his birthplace in Southern Rhodesia. This remained until 2004, when the plaque was transported to England and donated to the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum. Other memorials <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> were built in Bodø in 1977 and Purley, where his aircraft crashed, in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In Hull {{the bridge}} over the NER main line at Hessle Road was removed in 1962 and the {{elevated}} H&BR dock branch section became connected <b>to</b> the <b>Hull</b> <b>to</b> Selby Line at Hessle Road junction {{as part of a}} scheme {{to reduce the number of}} level crossings in Hull by routing all rail traffic <b>to</b> east <b>Hull</b> via the elevated Hull and Barnsley Line.|$|R
5000|$|After {{just one}} season in Qatar, Football League Championship side Hull City signed Okocha on a free {{transfer}} in 2007, after the player had {{been linked to}} Real Salt Lake and Sydney FC. It was a move he made saying that [...] "God {{had told him to}} do so". He however was not able to contribute greatly <b>to</b> <b>Hull's</b> promotion campaign due to fitness and constant injury problems, playing only 18 games and scoring no goals. Hull still succeeded in winning promotion to the Premier League, {{for the first time in}} their 104-year history. At the end of the season, after changing his mind on a proposed retirement due <b>to</b> <b>Hull's</b> promotion, he was released by the club, which ultimately sent him into retirement.|$|R

5|$|Donaldson was a trainee with Hull's youth {{system when}} scoring from close range on his first-team debut in Hull's Football League Trophy 3–1 away defeat to Port Vale on 22 October 2002, having {{replaced}} Gary Alexander as a 60th-minute substitute. He was sent out on loan to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Harrogate Town in November 2002, and {{scored in the}} 68th minute of his debut, a 3–1 away win over Gateshead on 12 November. He stayed with Harrogate for three months, in that time scoring 5 goals in 10 appearances before returning <b>to</b> <b>Hull.</b> He made his Football League debut for Hull on 8 February 2003, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Damien Delaney in a 1–0 defeat at home to Lincoln City. Two days later, he signed a two-year professional contract with Hull. He made one further appearance in the 2002–03 season, as a 69th-minute substitute in a 1–0 away win against Boston United.|$|E
5|$|England {{international}} goalkeeper Jerry Dawson missed three games, two {{because of}} an injury sustained in the opening match. Centre forward Bert Freeman, who had become the first ever Burnley player to score 100league goals, and held the club record for most goals in a season, played only four matches. His final appearance for Burnley came in the FA Cup Third Round defeat <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City. Several players made bit-part contributions to the campaign; Tom Brophy and Bob McGrory each made just three first-team appearances and Frank Birchenough, George Douglas, Jack Lane, Len Moorwood and Bill Taylor played in two matches or fewer. George Richardson and John Pearson, both new signings in the 1920–21 season, failed to make a first-team appearance for Burnley during the campaign. Thomas Jackson was a squad member until January 1921, {{but he did not}} play any games for Burnley in the 1920–21 campaign.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} career with local side Leeds United in 1984, before he moved on <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City for £200,000 in 1989. Two years later he {{transferred}} to Port Vale for a fee of £300,000. He spent three years with Vale, before he was sold on to Plymouth Argyle for the same price. During his time at Vale Park he was selected in the PFA's Second Division team {{of the season in}} 1992–93, before he won promotion out of the division in 1993–94; he also won the TNT Tournament in 1992 and the Football League Trophy in 1993 with the club. However at Plymouth he failed to find success, and was instead transferred to Burnley for £200,000 after just twelve months. In 1997, he signed with Bury for £50,000, before he returned to Burnley as a free transfer signing the following year. In 2000, he joined York City, before he retired later in the year.|$|E

5000|$|A chainplate is a {{metal plate}} used to fasten a shroud or stay <b>to</b> the <b>hull</b> of a sailboat.

5|$|He {{remained}} at the club as a player but was rarely selected for the team, and in January 2005, he went on loan <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City, where he was reunited once again with Peter Taylor. He made ten appearances for Hull, who gained promotion to the Football League Championship (the new name for what had been previously been called the First Division), while Gillingham were relegated from the same division. He returned to the Gillingham team {{at the start of}} the 2005–06 season and made a further 17 appearances, the final one in a 3–0 home win against Port Vale on 10 December 2005. At forty years and four months of age, he was the oldest player ever to represent the club. He rounded out his Gillingham career by returning to Priestfield Stadium for a testimonial match in July 2006. He is widely regarded as a club legend by Gillingham fans, who in 2005 voted him the team's best ever player in a local radio poll, and he was also named Gillingham's greatest ever player by the Professional Footballers' Association in November 2007.|$|E
5|$|He {{trained with}} newly formed League One club Milton Keynes Dons (MK Dons) and joined them on 24 September. Pacquette made his debut in a 4–2 victory over Hartlepool United and scored his first goal in his {{following}} match, a 3–0 victory over Brentford in the Football League Trophy. After making seven appearances for MK Dons, {{he was released}} in November, and subsequently signed for Southern League Division One East club Fisher Athletic later that month. He left the club to sign for Brentford in League One on non-contract terms on 26 November. He played for Brentford in a 2–0 defeat <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City. He left the club by mutual consent and signed for Conference National club Farnborough Town on 7 December. His debut came in a 1–1 draw with Canvey Island and his first goal came in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe.|$|E
5|$|Howarth {{continued}} to be {{kept out of the}} team in 2003–04, only making his first appearance after Achterberg was injured during the warm-up away to Swindon on 3 March 2004. Tranmere lost 2–0, although his performance was positive, making a number of good saves. However, Achterberg was declared fit for the following match against Millwall on 7 March 2004, and Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench. He did not play another match for Tranmere that season. Howarth's first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 20th-minute substitute after Achterberg was injured away <b>to</b> <b>Hull</b> City on 18 December 2004. After conceding a goal scored by Ian Ashbee in the 34th minute, Howarth was injured in a challenge with Stuart Elliott, and was substituted at half-time. He was available for Tranmere's next match against Barnsley on 26 December 2004, and with Achterberg ruled out for the Christmas period with a knee injury, he started in a 1–1 home draw. This meant Howarth had a run of nine consecutive matches in goal for Tranmere, with an appearance against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy Northern semi-final on 25 January 2005 being his last before Achterberg returned against Luton on 29 January. He failed to play again that season, and was released by Tranmere on 24 May 2005.|$|E
