5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
25|$|Gifts to {{the school}} by Judge Harris, at times when they were most needed, {{established}} an institution that has shed abroad the light of religion and education and has given to the State of Georgia {{and to the world}} a priceless heritage of education and refinement nowhere exceeded. From the halls of Young Harris College, scores of youths have gone forth blessing his name, and <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> brought honor to their state and country.|$|E
25|$|Stephen and Suzanne Roper, {{who live}} only 100 {{yards from the}} park, say that <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> been made a misery by {{the noise of the}} screams as well as {{fireworks}} displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge Mr Justice Hickinbottom later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.|$|E

25|$|On the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he'll live {{but they}} both know she is {{helpless}} to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company ("End Duet"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place ("Transformation") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle doesn't recognize {{him for the first}} time, she looks into his eyes and sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two of them sing of how <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom ("Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|The {{rights of}} {{livestock}} and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, {{even if they}} have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of their own kind or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Donen {{teamed up}} with Kelly for their third and final directorial collaboration. The musical It's Always Fair Weather was {{produced}} by Freed, written by Comden and Green and had music by André Previn. It starred Kelly, Dan Dailey, Cyd Charisse, Michael Kidd, and Dolores Gray. Originally envisioned as a sequel to On the Town, Kelly, Dailey and Kidd play three ex-GIs who reunite 10 years after World War II and discover that none of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> turned out quite how they had expected. Kelly had approached Donen with this project as their next collaboration and at first Donen was reluctant to accept due to his own success. Their friendship deteriorated during production and Donen noted, [...] "the atmosphere from day one was very tense and nobody was speaking to anybody." [...] He has {{been quoted as saying}} it was a [...] "one hundred percent nightmare" [...] which was a [...] "struggle from beginning to end" [...] and MGM did not allow the co-directors to shoot on location in New York. It's Always Fair Weather was a moderately profitable film, but not as successful as the pairs previous two films. It was Donen's last film with Kelly or Freed. After the film's completion he fulfilled his MGM contract agreement by working with other studios. His last project for MGM was completing the final four days of shooting on Kismet in July 1955 for director Vincent Minnelli, who had other commitments.|$|E
60|$|Several {{minutes more}} passed--minutes {{that seemed like}} hours to the boys, whose hearts thumped as never before. Both felt that a crisis in <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> arrived.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{that they}} cared nothing. Both felt already {{the shadow of}} death {{hovering}} over them. The supreme moment of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> come, and had found them side by side.|$|R
50|$|He is {{nowadays}} overshadowed, {{even as a}} writer, by {{the very}} much more famous British statesman of the same name, with whom he was acquainted, but not related. <b>Their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> some interesting parallels.|$|R
2500|$|Sarah Hall reports, [...] "ECT {{has been}} dogged by {{conflict}} between psychiatrists who swear by it, and some {{patients and families}} of patients who say that <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> been ruined by it. It is controversial in some European countries such as the Netherlands and Italy, where its use is severely restricted".|$|E
2500|$|Brown University {{computer}} scientist Michael Littman {{has argued that}} successful execution of the Internet of things requires consideration of the interface's usability {{as well as the}} technology itself. These interfaces need to be not only more user-friendly but also better integrated: [...] "If users need to learn different interfaces for their vacuums, their locks, their sprinklers, their lights, and their coffeemakers, it's tough to say that <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> been made any easier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly grudging was sportswriter John Feinstein, who stated on the {{syndicated}} sports talk show The Jim Rome Show in May 2007 [...] "I think they're guilty of everything but rape" [...] and [...] "I really don’t {{want to hear}} that they’re victims and martyrs, and that <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> been ruined." [...] Feinstein, who in March 2006 had demanded the revocation of the scholarships of every Duke men's lacrosse team member, and who (against the findings of the Coleman report) continued to describe the team as [...] "out-of-control", added [...] "I don't think I've been proven wrong." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{blew out}} the second candle, burning behind the closed curtains. I drew back, with Mr. Bruff and Betteredge, into the {{farthest}} corner by the bed. I signed to them to be silent, as if <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> depended on it.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{exposure}} of Patalkot's herbal remedies and plants to the outside world, the eco-balance of the valley is in question. The system of the valley that encompasses several villages and <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>has</b> been self-sustained {{over a long period}} of time.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his days}} in big band/swing music: [...] "It's really so long ago, one {{ought to be able}} to invoke a statute of limitations. I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> never forgotten it. So I get calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who ask me about this period of my life as though it were the present. But I've moved on to other things." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, 2011, Justice Paul G. Feinman of the New York State Supreme Court {{dismissed}} Brown's case, {{writing that}} the firefighter was [...] "an individual {{with a strong}} interest in preservation of the building", but added that he lacked any special legal standing regarding its fate. Adam Leitman Bailey, the lawyer who represented the Islamic center's developer pro bono, called the decision [...] "a victory for America" [...] and said, [...] "Despite the tempest of religious hatred, the judge flexed our Constitution's muscles enforcing the very bedrock of our democracy." [...] Jack Lester, a lawyer for Brown, said, [...] "We believe the brave men and women who risked <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> standing to preserve the monuments and historic buildings at ground zero." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luke Kleintank as Finn Abernathy (seasons 7–9): Finn is the {{youngest}} intern to date and has a messy background which includes a stay at the Juvenile Detention Center. He is from North Carolina and has a thick southern accent, which leads Hodgins to call him [...] "Opie". Finn, in turn, calls Hodgins, who is from a very wealthy family, [...] "Thurston". He and Hodgins go into business together to originally recreate and later sell hot sauce that Abernathy's grandmother made before she died. He and Cam's daughter {{fall in love and}} begin dating, initially behind her mother's back. She later breaks up with him after moving away to college, realizing that the distance and new developments in <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> caused them to drift apart.|$|E
50|$|In May 2009, BBC {{television}} broadcast Tourettes: I Swear I Can't Help It, {{a follow-up to}} the 1989 and 2002 documentaries, that caught up with both John (at 37) and a 15-year-old Greg, to see how <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> changed in seven years.|$|R
25|$|Two {{years to}} the day after the fire, band members Jack Russell and Mark Kendall, along with Great White’s attorney, Ed McPherson, {{appeared}} on Larry King Live with three survivors of the fire and the father of Ty Longley, to discuss how <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> changed since the incident.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has never}} {{come to you and}} me," [...] said the squire, with the {{slightest}} possible smile on his dry cheeks.

2500|$|Eccentric {{documentary}} filmmaker Declan Desmond {{offers an}} inside look at his work chronicling some of Springfield's finest for his documentary. Titled Growing Up Springfield, his film follows the lives of several Springfield residents, returning to them after eight-year intervals to examine how <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> changed. Clips from the film show a young Homer dreaming of growing up to live in a mansion, have a pinball machine with [...] "infinity quarters," [...] and eight pairs of peanut-butter-and-jelly pajamas. Sixteen years later, Homer is working as a manure salesman, infomercial question-asker, and open-casket caricaturist, but dreaming of being a rock star. In an interview with him and Marge, he says they plan to have no children. [...] After the next eight-year interval, Homer has given up on his dreams of fame and fortune to support his growing family. However, when Declan Desmond returns in the present day, he discovers that Homer has become extraordinarily wealthy, and the family is living in a mansion.|$|E

5000|$|An {{interesting}} non-critical response {{occurred on}} the campus of the South Carolina Collegiate Institute, when [...] "influenced by a recently published short story, a group of Carolina schoolmates planned a five-year reunion from which those who had married would not only be barred, but be compelled to submit written descriptions of what <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> become 'as wives or widows' and to lay bare [...] "the secrets of their prison houses." ...|$|R

That project - The Russian Chronicles: Ten Years Later - ran for eleven weeks on the Washingtonpost.com website.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. But I am {{not sorry}} we have come, all things considered,' she replied.

6000|$|... "I can't do it, Tedham," [...] I returned. [...] "It {{would be}} of no use. Besides, I don't like the errand. I'm not sure that I have any {{business}} to interfere.

6000|$|We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to understand that the phrase [...] "close similarity" [...] is no exaggeration, and to realise the value of the evidence I am about to adduce. Here are thirty-five cases of twins who were [...] "closely alike" [...] in body and mind when they were young, and who have been reared exactly alike up to their early manhood and womanhood. Since then the conditions of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>have</b> changed; what change of Nurture has produced the most variation? ...|$|E

60|$|She knew {{so little}} about him. <b>Their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>had</b> been spent apart.

60|$|And so {{the matter}} was settled: settled with much propriety and satisfaction; and both the lady and gentleman would have thought, had they ever thought about the matter at all, that this, the sweetest moment of <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> <b>had</b> been graced by all the poetry by which such moments ought to be hallowed.|$|R
60|$|It {{was also}} the habit of Captain McPherson and his man, James McGregor, to indulge daily in similar {{exercise}} {{at about the same}} hour, but, owing probably to <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>having</b> been spent chiefly on the sea, they were wont to ramble up a neighbouring glen in preference to sauntering on the shore.|$|R
