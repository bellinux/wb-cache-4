5|$|In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights of fourteen Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Malliswari, to release their digitally remastered versions in colour. Though the digitally remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful, Goldstone Technologies {{decided not to}} remaster the remaining fourteen films including Malliswari, saying {{that most of the}} producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them. Goldstone said furthermore that {{there were a number of}} legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something on their own.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not allow it due to a limited supply. Meanwhile, Jack tries to think of {{creative}} ways {{to spend time with}} his girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), as she works seven days a week.

This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E

5|$|In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights of 14Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pathala Bhairavi, to release their digitally re-mastered versions in colour. After {{the success of}} the digitised and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010, its makers announced that Pathala Bhairavi would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Pathala Bhairavi, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something on their own.|$|E
5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E

Because its impact was equally profound in Western Europe as in the United States, it helped unify Western countries against the Communist bloc.

25|$|Charlie and Itchy live in San Francisco as {{guardian}} angels. In each episode, {{they are}} given an assignment by Anabelle but, while they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the right thing, they become {{caught up in the}} middle of awkward situations. Charlie’s callous enemy Carface and his sidekick, Killer (from the first film), also appeared in the series, as did Charlie’s friends: the dog Sasha, the dog-angel Anabelle, and the human kid David. Finally, the series also featured two new characters named Bess, a pure bred award winning show dog and Itchy's love interest, and Belladonna, Anabelle's demonic cousin. The series makes several changes to the second film. For example, Charlie and Sasha were shown as being a couple at the end of the second film, however, in the series, they seem to have never had a first date together; also, Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, but he is alive in the series, although it is explained later in the series why he is on Earth instead of being in Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Females {{have their}} first {{ovulation}} at 13–14 {{months of age}} and have 20- to 26-day intervals between estrous cycles until they are fertilized. Males from traditional territories and leks have different courtship strategies. Males of traditional territories will herd females and keep them in their territories. Lek males <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, but usually fail. They {{have to rely on}} advertising themselves. Kob courtship may last as short as two minutes, and copulation may only last a few seconds. At leks, a female may mate up to 20 times with {{at least one of the}} central males in a day. After an eight-month gestation period and giving birth, estrus may commence 21–64 days later. For their first month, calves hide in dense vegetation. Mother and calf can identify each other by their noses. As they get older, calves gather into crèches. When they are three to four months old, the young enter the females' herds and stay with mothers until six to seven months, by which time they are weaned. When they mature, males join bachelors groups.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{incursion}} of Tarik, who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of Ifriqiya, Musa bin Nusayr, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar {{the following year}} and carried out a massive operation of conquest {{that would lead to}} the capture of Mérida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of Lugo and Gijón. In the latter city he placed a small Berber detachment under a governor, Munuza, whose mission was to consolidate Muslim control over Asturias. As guarantee of the submission of the region, some nobles – some argue that Pelayo was among them, had to surrender hostages from Asturias to Cordoba. The legend says that his sister was asked for, and a marriage alliance sought with the local Berber leader. Later on, Munuza would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same at another mountain post in the Pyrenees, where he rebelled against his Cordoban Arab superiors. The Berbers had been converted to Islam barely a generation earlier, and were considered second rank to Arabs and Syrians.|$|E
