25|$|The sonnet is a {{confession}} of the poets committed sins and promiscuity, which quickly escalates to his confession of love <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> With Shakespeare's heavy use of double meanings to words have scholars perplexed {{as to whether}} the sonnet is about Shakespeare's career as an actor or {{a confession}} of love <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> The sonnet is written in traditional Shakespearean sonnet form consisting of 14 lines with Iambic Pentameter and ending with a couplet.|$|E
25|$|The poet {{confesses to}} profligate and dishonest behaviour, but these faults have revitalised him. He {{will no longer}} look {{elsewhere}} but devote himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> who he hopes will welcome him back.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 32 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is a member of}} the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The writer is {{reflecting}} on a future in which the young man will probably outlive him. The writer takes a melancholy tone, telling the young man to remember the writer not because of the strength of the sonnets, but because the love that has been shown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> far surpasses any love shown by another poet.|$|E

500|$|Still {{eager to}} be {{initiated}} into a Pagan Witchcraft, or Wiccan, tradition, Buczsynki began contacting various covens requesting initiation, including the Gardnerian Wiccan coven run in Louisville, Kentucky by Fran and Gerry Fisher and the Algard Wiccan coven that had been founded by Mary Nesnick; the former refused due to the long-distance {{between them and the}} young man, while the latter declined due to Buczynski's homosexuality. He then approached Gwen Thompson (1928–1986), matriarch of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (NECTW), asking for initiation, although declined to inform her of his sexual orientation. Thompson took a liking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> and welcomed him into her coven, where he proceeded to adopt the craft name of [...] "Hermes". They developed a strong friendship, much to Slater's dismay, and Buczynski soon rose to a second degree position, adopting an adapted craft name of [...] "Hermes Dionysos" [...] and becoming High Priest of Thompson's coven. Thompson ultimately became attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> and repeatedly asked him to have sex with her, to which he refused. Their friendship broke down, and he was expelled from her North Haven coven.|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} of Lamb's release were {{that he must}} spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80sqkm; 0.31sqmi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate {{proved to be an}} industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including The Mask of Sanity by Hervey M. Cleckley, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. [...] "He wanted that kind of life," [...] Barker later told the Globe and Mail. [...] "He really seemed to need the esprit de corps of an army organisation." [...] When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the Yom Kippur War, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought State of Israel Bonds and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home. He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|As the sonnet {{is coming}} to an end, the poet expresses his devotion. He {{explains}} how he is done trying to find new affections. Radley and Redding explain that the [...] "no end" [...] he speaks of is his undying devotion. He no longer wants to go through these trials. He explains how he is done trying to find new affections. He realizes {{over the course of his}} quest that he ends up back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> which is where he originally began on his quest. The use of [...] "on newer proof" [...] is used as a description of the poet's trials he went through to come up with this conclusion of full devotion. He continues to express <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> that he is [...] "confined" [...] to him, promising him to never stray away from the young man when temptations arise. The use of the word confine suggests that the poet is fully devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> He is only [...] "limited" [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The sonnets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> express overwhelming, obsessional love. The {{main issue}} of debate {{has always been}} whether it {{remained}} platonic or became physical. The first 17 poems, traditionally called the procreation sonnets, are addressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing {{it to the next}} generation. Other sonnets express the speaker's love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's mistress; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are allegorical treatments of Greek epigrams referring to the [...] "little love-god" [...] Cupid.|$|E
2500|$|In Sonnet 13, for {{the first}} time, Shakespeare refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> as [...] "you" [...] instead of his usual address of [...] "thou", which he used in sonnets 1-12. This is more formal as thou, like the French [...] "tu" [...] is used for intimates [...] {{and the use of}} [...] "you" [...] here is {{therefore}} at odds with the personal intensity toward this figure of youth [...] Its use could signify potential loss.|$|E

2500|$|Cohen is {{mentioned}} in the Nirvana song [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] from the band's 1993 release, In Utero. Kurt Cobain wrote, [...] "Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld/So I can sigh eternally." [...] Cohen, after Cobain's suicide, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> I {{see a lot of people}} at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him." [...] He is also {{mentioned in the}} lyrics of songs by Mercury Rev and Marillion.|$|E
2500|$|As {{expressed}} in Sonnet 104, {{the figure of}} youth to whom the sonnets are directed towards is hinted {{to be someone who}} has had of at least three years. In attempts to match Shakespeare's references of time and known relationships, of who this figure of youth (and also W.H) [...] may be is William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who Shakespeare may have dedicated his First Folio. While the connection seems strong, it is only speculation. Sonnet 13 shows the increasing amount of love that the speaker holds for the man and is more intimate than the previous sonnets. It is also the first of Shakespeare's sonnets where he refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> as [...] "Love" [...] and [...] "My dear love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Murray Krieger {{offers a}} {{different}} view of the contract theory seen within Sonnet 87. In his analysis, he focuses his attention {{on the use of the}} word [...] "dear" [...] within the first line. He notes that the reader's initial deduction of the word [...] "dear" [...] implies the idea of affection. But this initial impression of the word on the reader is immediately confronted by the word [...] "estimate", which essentially uncovers the reality of the speaker's lowly position <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Kreiger furthermore notes that the legal and financial terms strongly imply the poet's bitterness towards his position: [...] "at having love's world of troth reduced to the niggardly world of truth, the world of faith to the world of fact".|$|E
2500|$|Ronald Levao {{agrees with}} Thomas M. Greene's {{understanding}} that the Speaker replaces [...] "superficial pomp, external loyalty, and possibly the [...] "art" [...] of poetry itself" [...] with [...] "pure simplicity and single-minded, quasi-religious devotion" [...] {{in order to receive}} [...] "mutual render". He does disagree with Greene's summation of the informer from line 13. Levao sees the informer as some unnamed person who has broken the mood of Sonnet 125 by bringing forth accusations against the Speaker. This changes the meaning of the sonnet for Levao. He sees it as [...] "not a defiance of Time or court gossip nor even a reproach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> for spurning the proffered mutuality, but the poet's final attempt to revive his commitment".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} debated by many critics and {{scholars}} {{whether or not}} sonnet 110 was written about Shakespeare's career in the theater or if the sonnet is a confession of love to a young man. The lines in the sonnet {{could be related to}} the stage but scholars Virginia L. Radley and David C. Redding disagree stating that sonnet 110 is, [...] "addressed to an old friend of the poet's." [...] Sonnet 110 can be interpreted as a confession of love and the mistakes the poet made when he decided to leave his original love. The poet confesses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> his infidelities and regrets in order to receive pity from the young man for what the poet did was wrong but should be forgiven since he claimed the young man is the best person he will ever love.|$|E

60|$|The voyage was a {{pleasant}} one, and was, for the times, quick, occupying only five months. But <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> longing for home after so long an absence, it seemed tedious in the extreme.|$|R
2500|$|Sonnet 32 {{is highly}} {{dependent}} upon {{the relationship between the}} subject and speaker of the sonnet. [...] The speaker of the sonnet reflects upon [...] "his own mortality" [...] in comparing himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> whom he loves, whether romantically or in friendship it is unclear. [...] The speaker refers to himself as the [...] "deceased lover" [...] which is significant as it highlights the age difference between the two men, a perpetual theme throughout Sonnet 32 as well {{as the rest of the}} handsome youth sonnets. [...] After accepting, his eventual death, the speaker takes on a [...] "self-deprecating" [...] tone referring to his poetry as [...] "poor rude lines" [...] (4) and beseeching the youth to remember him after his death. [...] This emphasis on his failure in poetry is imperative as it frames the rest of the sonnet and the speaker's request for the young man to remember him [...] "for his love" [...] (14).|$|E
2500|$|The couplet {{brings the}} sonnet {{together}} in a happy light. Throughout the sonnet we're learning about the poet's dark confessions to finding his ideal love and realizing the only love that he needs the most is of the young mans. Jane Roessner notices how the line [...] "then give me welcome, next my heaven the best" [...] is [...] "the poet's need of pity from the young man and how his long confession important for {{its effect on the}} young man, calculated to move him to a certain response." [...] Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to embrace him. The phrase in line 13 [...] "next my heaven the best" [...] is the poet confessing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> that his love is like his heaven. He is the closest thing to the divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, [...] "your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person." [...] The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.|$|E
2500|$|They {{eventually}} {{arrived at}} a building on Canal Street and proceeded to an office of the second floor where Lewis [...] "bought" [...] a ticket from a young man. While there, Lewis showed Ramsden his valise and showed him the various tools of his trade, mainly muslin and paint goods, before discovering a pack of cards {{at the bottom of}} the bag. He then demonstrated a card trick which he claimed had cost him $400 in a Bowery saloon the day before. Showing him how to play three-card monte, the man who had sold Lewis the ticket encouraged Ramsden to play a hand. When Ramsden refused to bet however, the man attempted to provoke him claiming he had no money to bet with. He then asked Lewis to leave and, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> he showed him a roll of bank notes from the Bank of England worth ₤50. At this point, Lewis grabbed the roll and ran out of the building. When the astonished Ramsden had recovered, he went outside to find Lewis but he had long since escaped. Similarly, he returned to the office to find the room had been emptied.|$|E
