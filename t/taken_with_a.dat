5|$|Vasari {{suggests}} that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess. Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500florins, yet its exactness may be <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grain of salt.|$|E
5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E

5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} Florentine , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E

The first X-ray picture (<b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.|$|E

25|$|An {{accurate}} and comprehensive {{history of the}} revolution has proven difficult to compile {{for a number of}} reasons. There are no contemporary accounts, and most sources were written more than a century after the revolution. Because most historical sources were written under Abbasid rule, the description of the Umayyads must be <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grain of salt; such sources describe the Umayyads, at best, as merely placeholders between the Rashidun and Abbasid Caliphates.|$|E
25|$|Photography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made {{photographs}} or {{had them}} made by {{his friends and}} assistants. These pictures were mostly <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> specific model of Polaroid camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took {{an enormous amount of}} photographs of Factory visitors, friends.|$|E

25|$|Bowie {{collaborated with}} English pop artist Derek Boshier {{on the cover}} design. The {{original}} gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer Brian Duffy as an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Polaroid SX-70 type camera. The inside of the gatefold included pictures of Che Guevara's corpse, Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation of Christ and Bowie being readied for the cover photo. These images were not reproduced in the Rykodisc CD reissue in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The photos, <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheap Instamatic camera, {{show what}} appears to be a male ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} perched on the trunks of two trees in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos– taken from a distance– are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|E
25|$|Oral Isotretinoin is best absorbed when <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high-fat meal, {{because it}} has a high level of lipophilicity. The {{efficacy}} of isotretinoin doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to Isotretinoin's molecular relationship to Vitamin A, it should not be taken with Vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. Accutane also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed ('mini-pill') progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol ('OrthoNovum 7/7/7'), St. John's Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids.|$|E

25|$|From {{after the}} conquest of the land under Joshua until the {{formation}} of the first Kingdom of Israel, the Tribe of Reuben was a part of a loose confederation of Israelite tribes. No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as Judges (see the Book of Judges). In this period, according to the ancient Song of Deborah, Reuben declined {{to take part in the}} war against Sisera, the people instead idly resting among their flocks as if it were a time of peace, though the decision to do so was <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy heart.|$|E
25|$|In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, {{ostensibly to}} find an American {{publisher}} for Atget's photographs. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, {{she went back to}} Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. Her first photographs of the city were <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hand-held Kurt-Bentzin camera, but soon she acquired a Century Universal camera which produced 8 x 10inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed New York City with the diligence and attention to detail she had so admired in Eugène Atget. Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|Rome's second Emperor died at {{the port}} town of Misenum on 16 March AD 37, {{at the age of}} 78 years, having reigned for 23 years. Suetonius writes that the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard Naevius Sutorius Macro smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession. According to Suetonius, he was known for his cruelty and debauchery through his {{perversion}} on the island of Capri where he forced young boys and girls into orgies. On one account when one of the boys complained, Tiberius had his legs broken. Suetonius' claims, however, have to be <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> degree of skepticism, due to bitterness from the reign of previous emperors that usually accompanies the coming of a new leader.|$|E
