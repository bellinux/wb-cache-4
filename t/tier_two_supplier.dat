40|$|This article {{illustrates}} {{the integration of}} discrete event simulation into the capacity planning process of a <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> automobile <b>supplier.</b> In this application, the capacity planning process is able to generate a feasible schedule for the 30 % of the product line which generates 80 % of the business. The schedule is “feasible ” based {{on the ability to}} produce sufficient inventory to cover customer demand. The capacity planning process was unable to develop a schedule for the production of the remaining 70 % of the product line or take into account shortages in customer supplied materials used in the production process. Simulation is used to validate the capacity planning process as well as generate a feasible schedule for the remaining products during the planning period as well as: evaluating the plan for customer supplied materials; identifying potential areas for improvement in the production process and determining material storage requirements for the facilities planner...|$|R
30|$|The inter-firm {{relationships}} in SCNs are generally modelled using undirected links. However, {{the links between}} nodes in a SCN can include a direction, depending on the specific type of relationship being modelled. The inter-firm {{relationships in}} a SCN can be broadly categorised into three classes, namely; (1) material flows, (2) financial flows, and (3) information exchanges. Material flows are usually unidirectional from suppliers to retailers, while financial flows are unidirectional in the opposite direction. Both material and financial flows mostly occur vertically, across the functional tiers of a SCN (however, in some cases, two firms within the same <b>tier,</b> such as <b>two</b> <b>suppliers,</b> could also exchange material and finances) (Lazzarini et al., 2001). In contrast, information exchanges are bidirectional (i.e. undirected) and includes both vertical and horizontal connections (i.e. between firms across tiers and between firms within the same tier). Therefore, the same SCN can include different topologies based on the specific type of relationship denoted by the links in the model. For instance, unlike material and financial flows, SCN topology for information exchanges can exhibit shorter path lengths and high clustering due to relatively larger number of horizontal connections (Hearnshaw and Wilson, 2013).|$|R

50|$|Tier two is {{designed}} to provide interventions to support students who are not responding to tier one prevention strategies. Therefore, <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> approaches offer more support than tier one interventions. Because fewer students require <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> services, students are at risk for engaging in more serious, problematic behaviors. Within <b>tier</b> <b>two,</b> simple functional behavioral assessment (FBA) are used to identify students' functioning to support individualized interventions and strategies. Students' individualized interventions are referred to as behavioral intervention plan (BIP). These two approaches are used to promote positive social interactions.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a teacher-implemented <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> behavior intervention and differential effects based on function of student problem behavior. The participants were 36 public elementary school students who were nominated for additional behavior support beyond universal School-wide Positive Behavior Support. The intervention provided was Check-In/Check-Out, a <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> intervention using direct behavior ratings to increase structure and feedback to the student’s environment. Before and after implementation of the intervention, the authors assessed the students’ function of behavior, levels of problem behavior, prosocial behavior, and rate of behavioral incidents. A multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant effects for all students in prosocial behavior and behavioral incidents, but not problem behavior. An analysis of interaction effects indicated statistically significant differences in response to intervention based on function of problem behavior. Results are discussed in terms of considering function of problem behavior in selecting <b>tier</b> <b>two</b> interventions and implementing a three tier response to intervention model...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the role of}} {{capacity}} on the efficiency of a two-tier supply chain with <b>two</b> <b>suppliers</b> (leaders, first <b>tier)</b> and one retailer (follower, second tier). The suppliers compete via pricing (Bertrand competition) and, {{as one would expect}} in practice, are faced with production capacity. We consider a model with differentiated substitutable products where the suppliers are symmetric differing only by their production capacity. We characterize the prices, production amounts and profits in three cases: (1) the suppliers compete in a decentralized Nash equilibrium game, (2) the suppliers “cooperate” to optimize the total suppliers’ profit, and (3) the <b>two</b> <b>tiers</b> of the supply chain are centrally coordinated. We show that in a decentralized setting, the supplier with a lower capacity may benefit from restricting her capacity even when additional capacity is available at no cost. We also show that the loss of total profit due to decentralization cannot exceed 25  % of the centralized chain profits. Nevertheless, the loss of total profit is not a monotonic function of the “degree of asymmetry” of the suppliers’ capacities. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the supplier profit loss at equilibrium (compared with the cooperation setting) that depends on the “market power” of the suppliers as well as their market size. We show that there is less supplier profit loss as the asymmetry (in terms of their capacities) increases between the <b>two</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The worst case arises when the <b>two</b> <b>suppliers</b> are completely symmetric.
