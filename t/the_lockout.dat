5|$|In May 2008, {{the owners}} decided {{to opt out}} of the 1993 arrangement, per the {{agreement}} with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin <b>the</b> <b>lockout</b> with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated <b>the</b> <b>lockout</b> the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of <b>the</b> <b>lockout.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>lockout,</b> players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.|$|E

5|$|The Senators, {{like the}} other NHL teams, did not play during <b>the</b> <b>lockout.</b> Most players chose to play in Europe, {{although}} some, including Jason Spezza, played for the Senators' farm team, the Binghamton Senators. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>lockout,</b> the Senators had acquired free agent goaltender Dominik Hasek. He did not play for any teams during the season, instead practicing with Binghamton. Daniel Alfredsson {{had a very good}} season in Sweden with Frölunda HC, winning the Swedish championship.|$|E
5|$|As {{both sides}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the NBA {{canceled}} the preseason and all games through December. On November 14, the players dissolved the union, allowing them to file antitrust lawsuits against the league. On November 26, both sides reached a tentative agreement to end <b>the</b> <b>lockout.</b> The new CBA calls for a revenue split of 49-to-51.2% and a flexible salary cap structure with harsher luxury tax. After the tentative deal was reached, owners allowed players to have voluntary workouts at team sites starting December 1. After the deal was ratified on December 8, training camps, trades and free agency began the next day. During <b>the</b> <b>lockout,</b> some players signed contracts to play in other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, with most of them having the option to return upon the lockout's conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>lockout</b> also affected the economy due largely to NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.|$|E

5|$|The 1998–99 season, {{which began}} on February 5, 1999, was {{shortened}} to 50 games per team, {{as opposed to}} the normal 82. As a result of the 204-day lockout, 464 regular-season games were lost. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>lockout,</b> the NBA's popularity was affected by the second retirement of Michael Jordan, who had been largely responsible for an increase in fan interest during his career. The average attendance during the shortened season was 16,738 fans per game, down 2.2percent from the 1997–98 average of 17,117 spectators per contest. Ticket sales fell nearly twopercent further in the opening months of 1999–00, and remained under 17,000 per game for the following three seasons. The league also saw television ratings drop for three consecutive seasons after <b>the</b> <b>lockout.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{received}} a tepid response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the work stoppage. Quickly ratified by the owners and players, the deal was signed later in January, ending <b>the</b> <b>lockout</b> after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In the months after <b>the</b> <b>lockout,</b> television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E
