5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red. Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E

5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E

5|$|The {{exploration}} of Jupiter {{has been conducted}} via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began {{with the arrival of}} Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accepted. There exist geographic forms of {{short-finned pilot whale}}s off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|E
5|$|To Ann's surprise, Chris (Rob Lowe) {{has also}} been {{admitted}} to the hospital with the flu. The <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dating and, although Ann really likes Chris, she fears he is too perfect. However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann feel less intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses have agreed to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party.

Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E
5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time.

Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past.

Up to this point the <b>two</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recounting individual tales to each other.
