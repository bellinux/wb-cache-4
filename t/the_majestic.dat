5|$|Sixteen light fleet {{carriers}} were ordered, and {{all were}} laid down as what became the Colossus class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> class. The improvements from the Colossus class to <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> class included heavier displacement, armament, catapult, aircraft lifts and aircraft capacity. Construction on the ships was suspended {{at the end of}} World War II, as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Majestic</b> {{class of}} nine pre-dreadnought battleships were {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the mid-1890s under the Spencer Programme, named after the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Poyntz Spencer. With nine units commissioned, they were the largest class of battleships in history {{in terms of the}} number of member ships. The nine ships, , , , , , , , , and , were built between 1894 and 1898 as part of a {{programme}} to strengthen the Royal Navy versus its two traditional rivals, France and Russia. This continued the naval re-armament initiatives begun by the Naval Defence Act 1889.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>majestic</b> yet fairly traditional compositions {{by the two}} Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use of sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being irritated by Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. Other music used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an electronically altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E

2500|$|To save weight the Canopus class carried less armour than <b>the</b> <b>Majestics,</b> but {{a change}} from Harvey armour in <b>the</b> <b>Majestics</b> to Krupp armour in the Canopus class meant that the {{protective}} capability of the armour was maintained. [...] Part of their armour scheme included {{the use of a}} special [...] armoured deck over the armour belt to defend against plunging fire by the howitzers that France had reportedly planned to install on its ships, although this report proved to be false.|$|R
5|$|Loder {{returned}} to Newfoundland on April 2; the following month, she performed at Gros Morne National Park's Trails, Tails & Tunes Festival with Dave Paddon. That July, she performed alongside Nick Hamlyn at Corner Brook's Downtown Days festival. In December 2012, she held two free coffeehouses in Newfoundland: at the Stavanger Drive Second Cup on the 15th and at Cornerstone Ministry Centre on the 21st. Over the subsequent {{months into the}} middle of 2013, she performed on a monthly basis at the Stavanger Drive Second Cup, which is owned by Newman. She also performed at <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> Theatre and the Fat Cat Blues Bar in St. John's. In 2013, she was named a showcase winner by the Christian Women in Media Association (CWIMA) and was selected to perform at the organization's national conference.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{approved}} {{the design and}} intended to lay down three ships under the 1892 programme, but work on the 12in gun was taking longer than predicted, and so construction was delayed to the 1893 programme. By that time, the third ship {{of what was to}} be <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> class was redesigned as a second-class battleship, , leaving only two ships to be laid down under the 1893 estimates. By August 1893, however, the public perceived the strength of the Royal Navy to have fallen relative to its traditional rivals, the French and Russian navies. John Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a large naval expansion plan referred to as the Spencer Programme that included seven more Majestic-class battleships to soothe public opinion.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} twelve roadshows {{were held}} throughout 1941, {{which included a}} 39-week run at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles from January 29. Fantasia broke the long-run record at the venue in its twenty-eighth week; a record previously held by Gone with the Wind. Its eight-week run at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50,000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue. Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months, the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks, <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> Theatre in Boston, the Apollo Theater in Chicago, and also in Philadelphia, Detroit, Buffalo, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} laid {{down for the}} Royal Navy as the lead ship of <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> class in April 1943, and was {{launched}} as HMS Majestic (R77) in February 1945. At the end of World War II, work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947. At the time of purchase, {{it was decided to}} incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design, making Melbourne the third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck. Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955.|$|E
5|$|Tyldesley's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in outlets for the entertainment of its population, including cinemas and public houses. Films were shown in Tyldesley Miners' Hall from 1908. Three cinemas {{were built in}} the town, the Theatre Royal in John Street opened in 1909, the Carlton on Johnson Street in 1911, and <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> in Castle Street in 1923. In 1902 the council acquired land for a public park on Astley Street. A public library was built in 1908 with the aid of an Andrew Carnegie grant, {{on the site of the}} old Temperance Hall and Mechanics Institute on Stanley Street built in 1851.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. <b>The</b> <b>Majestic</b> Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
50|$|Albion was {{designed}} for service in the Far East, {{and to be able}} to transit the Suez Canal. She {{was designed}} to be smaller (by about 2,000 tons), lighter, and faster than her predecessors, the Majestic-class battleships, although she was slightly longer at 430 feet (131 meters). In order to save weight, she carried less armour than <b>the</b> <b>Majestics,</b> although <b>the</b> change from Harvey armour in <b>the</b> <b>Majestics</b> to Krupp armour in Albion meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Still, her armour was light enough to make her almost a second-class battleship.|$|R

5|$|Pickford {{was born}} Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting {{on stage in}} 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, {{she moved to the}} Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> Film Company later that same year, {{followed}} by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract that made her a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.|$|E
5|$|When Labor Council Secretary Robert King {{organised}} {{a conference}} of dissident left-wing unions on 1 August 1936, which was attended by Heffron and three other caucus members, Lang summoned a special party conference on 22 August which expelled Heffron, King {{and all the other}} leaders who attended the conference. As a result, Heffron, along with his colleague Carlo Lazzarini and others, formed the Industrial Labor Party (ILP), which was also known as the 'Heffron Labor Party'. Despite their expulsion, Heffron and the new ILP did increasingly well against Lang and the Labor Party, winning two subsequent by-elections in the seats of Hurstville (won by Clive Evatt) and Waverley (won by Clarrie Martin). In June 1939, three other MPs, Frank Burke (Newtown), Mat Davidson (Cobar) and Ted Horsington (Sturt), unhappy with Lang's leadership joined the ILP. As a result of its success, John Curtin and the federal executive of the ALP pressured the NSW ALP to readmit Heffron and his party at a unity conference at <b>the</b> <b>Majestic</b> Theatre in Newtown on 26 August 1939. Heffron then combined forces with William McKell to depose Lang on 5 September 1939, with McKell becoming the new leader of the party, although he declined to stand for the position of deputy leader.|$|E

50|$|The Ebersons {{moved to}} Chicago in 1910. In Chicago, Eberson {{was able to}} {{increase}} his theatre architectural commissions. An early client was Karl Hoblitzelle's Interstate Amusement Company. The first two theatres he designed for Hoblitzelle were <b>the</b> Fort Worth <b>Majestic</b> (Fort Worth, TX, 1911) and <b>the</b> Austin <b>Majestic</b> (Austin, TX, 1915). Neither was ground-breaking in design, and neither was in the atmospheric style. He first experimented with atmospheric design at <b>the</b> Dallas <b>Majestic</b> (1921), <b>the</b> Indiana Theatre (Terre Haute) (1922) and the Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas) (1922). It was {{in the design of}} <b>the</b> Houston <b>Majestic</b> (1923) that Eberson created his first full atmospheric theatre.|$|R
50|$|The Formidables had an {{improved}} hull form {{that made them}} handier at high speeds than <b>the</b> <b>Majestics.</b> They also had inward-turning propellers, which allowed reduced fuel consumption and slightly higher speeds than in previous classes but {{at the expense of}} less manoeuvrability at low speeds.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, {{beginning}} with <b>the</b> Hoblitzelle <b>Majestic</b> Theatre (Houston, 1923, razed), Eberson perfected a new theatre design, which {{became known as}} the atmospheric theatre style. Eberson himself credited <b>the</b> Hoblitzelle <b>Majestic</b> Theatre (Houston, 1923, razed) as the first atmospheric style theatre. Clearly, Eberson tried out some of his concepts at the Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas) (1922) and the Indiana Theatre (Terre Haute, Indiana) (1922). However, with <b>the</b> Houston <b>Majestic</b> he perfected <b>the</b> style, adding features that made the departure from all that came before.|$|R
