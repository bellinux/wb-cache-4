5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E

5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> one side {{and work on the}} other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968.

The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E

5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{geographic}} isolation of their homeland, the Hupa had few interactions with early European explorers, although they later came {{in conflict with}} miners looking for gold.

They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley Reservation is {{the largest and most}} populous in the state.|$|E
