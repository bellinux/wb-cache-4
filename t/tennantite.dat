50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} at Phillipsburg in 1864, {{and the district}} {{was one of the}} most prolific silver producers in Montana. Major mines included the Granite Mountain mine, the Bi-Metallic mine, and the Hope mine. In 1887, the district produced 2.2 million troy ounces (68 metric tons) of silver, making it the largest silver producer in the US for that year. The district suffered greatly from the fall in the price of silver in 1893, and remained moribund until World War I, when the manganese deposits of the district became valuable, and Philipsburg became one of the top US producers of that metal. Silver occurs in veins filling fracture zones through Paleozoic limestone. Minerals in the silver-ore veins include polybasite, pyrargyrite, proustite, sphalerite, galena, and <b>tennantite.</b> Manganese occurs as replacement bodies of pyrolusite and rhodochrosite in limestone adjacent to the fracture zones. No mines are presently active in the district.|$|E
50|$|The {{oxidation}} and supergene advancement {{have led}} to the development of four mineralogically and spatially distinct ore types or zones. The hematite-goethite-quartz gossan, from 0- to ~30-m depth, has high gold, silver, and lead contents, with native gold, argentiferous gold, electrum, anglesite, and lesser cerussite. The kaolinite-quartz-sulfate zone occurs at ~25- to 35- m depth, and also is enriched in gold, silver, and lead, and has the same ore mineralogy as the gossan; additionally it has minor chalcocite and minor to trace amounts of unusual zinc-lead-iron carbonate and sulfate minerals. The supergene sulfide zone is present from about 35 to 65 m in depth and has significant copper enrichment, with predominantly chalcocite, and lesser digenite, covellite, and bornite, along with pyrite, minor pyrrhotite, anglesite, and gangue minerals. The primary massive sulfide, from ~65- to more than 450-m depth, has a noteworthy deposit of zinc-rich ore and a typical VMS sulfide assemblage of pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and minor to trace galena, pyrrhotite, tetrahedrite, <b>tennantite,</b> arsenopyrite, baryte, and gangue.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacosiderite has an {{isometric}} crystal system, with yellowish-green, sharply defined cube crystals. Its crystals are doubly refracting, {{and exhibit}} a banded structure in polarized light. When placed in ammonium solution, a crystal changes color to a distinguishing red. Upon placing it into dilute hydrochloric acid the original color is restored.This secondary origin mineral is normally {{formed in the}} oxidation zones of ore deposits. The alteration of arsenopyrite, <b>tennantite</b> and other primary arsenates can form pharmacosiderite. It can also form from precipitation of hydrothermal solutions, but only rarely. It {{can be found in}} abundance in Cornwall, Hungary and the U.S. state of Utah.When it was first discovered, pharmacosiderite was known as cube ore. The present name, given by J. F. L. Hausmann in 1813, is made up of the Greek words for arsenic and iron, the two most significant consisting elements. Pharmakos means poison, which is related to arsenic, and sideros means iron.Pharmacolite and picropharmacolite, which are different arsenates, are not associated besides via nomenclature. Siderite, a carbonate mineral, only shares the common element iron with pharmacosiderite.|$|E
5000|$|Tin {{extraction}} and use can be {{dated to}} the beginning of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC, during which copper objects formed from polymetallic ores had different physical properties [...] The earliest bronze objects had tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in copper ores such as <b>tennantite,</b> which contains arsenic [...] The addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness, lowers the melting temperature, and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser, less spongy metal [...] This was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed molds of the Bronze Age. Arsenical bronze objects appear first in the Middle East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore, but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age [...] This created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age cultures.|$|E
