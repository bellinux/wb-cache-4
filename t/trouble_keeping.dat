5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester, and was {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn, the series director of photography. The cast found the scene in which Jim impersonates Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to be hilarious and had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> straight faces, forcing multiple takes. The episode first aired in the United States on April 26, 2007 on NBC, during sweeps week. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by an estimated 7.56 million viewers, earning a ratings share of 3.9/11 among adults. It garnered generally positive critical reception, particularly regarding Jim and Dwight's impressions of each other.|$|E
5|$|In 1171 Rhys {{made peace}} with King Henry and was {{confirmed}} in possession of his recent conquests {{as well as being}} named Justiciar of South Wales. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter's death in 1189. Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St David's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus was {{the largest}} {{predator}} in its environment, while the only known large herbivores {{at the time were}} sauropods like Rapetosaurus. Scientists have suggested that Majungasaurus, and perhaps other abelisaurids, specialized on hunting sauropods. Adaptations to strengthen the head and neck for a bite-and-hold type of attack might have been very useful against sauropods, which would have been tremendously powerful animals. This hypothesis may also be supported by the hindlegs of Majungasaurus, which were short and stocky, as opposed to the longer and more slender legs of most other theropods. While Majungasaurus would not have moved as fast as other similar-sized theropods, it would have had no <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> up with slow-moving sauropods. The robust hindlimb bones suggest very powerful legs, and their shorter length would have lowered the animal's center of gravity. Thus Majungasaurus may have sacrificed speed for power. Majungasaurus tooth marks on Rapetosaurus bones confirm that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.|$|E

5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The Allied armies in Italy {{launched}} their spring offensive (Operation Grapeshot) on 6 April 1945 {{and it made}} rapid progress. 2nd AA Brigade accompanied X Corps, but {{had little to do}} – its guns had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> up with the speed of the advance. The campaign ended with the surrender of German forces in Italy on 2 May 1945.|$|E

25|$|Still, Baldwin had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> {{pace with}} orders {{and in the}} early 1850s began paying workers piece-rate pay. Taking {{advantage}} of human nature, this increased incentives and productivity. By 1857, the company turned out 66 locomotives and employed 600 men. But another economic downturn, this time the Panic of 1857, cut into business again. Output fell by 50 percent in 1858.|$|E
25|$|But at 38, Camaleón had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> up {{with the}} {{workload}} required. In 1967–1968, he saw limited action after injuring the Achilles tendon early in the season. Overall, he played in 11 games and went 4-for-19 (.211) with one RBI, being mostly used as a pinch-hitter. Continuing to decrease his playing role, due to his injury, he was 1-for-14 (.071) in 1968–1969. He appeared in just six games, and was released by Magallanes {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, Greenhough took 111 wickets for Lancashire, {{and played}} one Test against South Africa, but 1961 was {{wiped out by}} {{the first of a}} {{succession}} of finger injuries. Even when he had recovered, he again ran into the problem of lacking spin, despite a few good performances as the only recognised slow bowler in a now-weak county side. Despite more finger <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> him out of the Lancashire side for most of 1964, he was awarded a benefit that season and showed when he returned that he still had considerable skill. He achieved a career-best seven for 56 against Worcestershire in the last county match, plus seven for 108 against MCC in the previous game.|$|E
25|$|The French {{had also}} {{suffered}} severe fatigue and deprivation during their pursuit having to travel over ground already crossed by the British. The British rear guard had held off the pursuing French, allowing {{the rest of}} the British army to continue to withdraw, however the French cavalry had continually pressed them and prevented effective reconnaissance by the British cavalry. Soult's infantry had also had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> up and was badly strung out and most were well behind the cavalry which included the divisions of Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and Jean Baptiste Marie Franceschi-Delonne. Soult's three infantry divisions, commanded by Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet and Henri François Delaborde, and his artillery would arrive at Corunna piecemeal over the next few days.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> their footing on a rain-soaked Philadelphia field. Bill Capece missed three field goals, while Neal Colzie's slip while {{covering}} Charlie Smith {{set up a}} Tony Franklin field goal. Wilbert Montgomery {{suffered a}} pinched nerve {{in the first half}} that was expected to keep him sidelined for a month, but he instead returned in the second half to gain 119 yards on 22 carries. The Buccaneers failed to capitalize on a questionable Philadelphia play-call in the fourth quarter, when the Eagles elected to run on fourth-and-one, despite holding a 13–10 lead. Norris Thomas recovered Booker Russell's fumble on the ensuing play, and if not for Ron Jaworski's tackle, would have run for a touchdown. Doug Williams' interception two plays later ended any hopes of a comeback. The Eagles finished the game with an NFL-best 7–1 record.|$|E

25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times Stephen Holden gave a mixed review {{saying the}} film [...] "does a better-than-average job of {{conveying}} the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, {{but it is}} still not especially scary. What sets its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality." [...] He said the film is [...] "seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed." [...] Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times also gave the film a mixed review saying, [...] "Saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch." [...] She said the film [...] "carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness." [...] She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had <b>trouble</b> <b>keeping</b> an American accent.
