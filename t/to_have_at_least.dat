5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English.

5|$|Nearly all Finnish horses foaled since 1971 {{have been}} registered. During {{the first decade}} of the 21st century, the breed's numbers in Finland stabilised at roughly 20,000 animals, and {{approximately}} 1,000 foals are born annually.

5|$|Until the 18th century, Lipizzans {{had other}} coat colors, {{including}} dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray {{was the color}} preferred by the royal family, and so the color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, {{it came to be}} the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses. However, it is a long-standing tradition for the Spanish Riding School <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.|$|E

5|$|According to Oricon, Avex Trax had {{expected}} to ship approximately 400,000 total units in its first week of sales; as a result, the sales mark were printed and distributed for several stores throughout Japan. Rock 'n' Roll Circus debuted at {{number one on the}} Japanese Daily Oricon Albums Chart, staying there for an entire week. This resulted in the album debuting atop the Japanese Weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with an estimated 205,000 sold units in its first week of sales. This became the highest selling album by a female artist for first week sales of 2010. Rock 'n' Roll Circus became Hamasaki's tenth studio album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart for both Daily and Weekly rankings, making Hamasaki the first artist <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one album {{at the top of the}} charts for 12 consecutive years.

5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, {{as opposed to the}} antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours with the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.|$|E

Nadal leads on grass 2–1 and clay 15–7, while Djokovic leads on hard courts 18–7. They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9–4, and 4–3 in finals. The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by ATPworldtour.com and is widely {{considered to be the}} greatest rivalry {{in the history of the}} sport. Djokovic is the first player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively, which he did twice.

Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by many to be the greatest match ever played and their 2013 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match ever played.|$|E
5|$|Ginóbili {{was to play}} an {{even bigger}} role for the Spurs the {{following}} season, reaching career high averages in points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goal percentage. With this improvement, Ginobili was named an NBA All-Star {{for the second time}} in his career.

On 21 April 2008, the NBA announced that Ginóbili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award; only a couple of weeks later, the Argentine was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns 4–1 in the first round, Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games. San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games, the Argentine played another strong series, leading the Spurs in points and assists per game (21.3 and 6.0 respectively). However, San Antonio lost to arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games, and once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E
