40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a beamforming-based dynamic {{spectrum}} leasing (DSL) technique {{to improve the}} spectral utility of bi-directional communication of the legacy/primary spectrum users through the help of colocated secondary users. The secondary users help for a time interval to relay the data between two primary terminals using physical layer network coding and beamforming to attain bi-directional communication with high spectral utility. As a reimbursement, the secondary users, cognitive radios (CRs) in our case, get exclusive access to the primary spectrum for a certain duration. We use Nash bargaining to determine the optimal division of temporal resources between relaying and reimbursement. Moreover, we consider that a fraction of secondary nodes can act selfishly by not helping the primary, yet enjoy <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>time.</b> We measure {{the utility of the}} DSL scheme in terms of a metric called time-bandwidth product (TBP) ratio quantifying the number of bits transmitted in direct communication versus DSL. We show that if all secondary nodes act honestly, more than 17 -fold increase in the TBP ratio is observed for a sparse CR network. However, in such a network, selfish behavior of CR nodes can reduce the gain by more than a factor of 2...|$|E

40|$|Nursing home {{expenditures}} {{have become}} a public policy concern primarily because the Medicaid program payes for approximately 50 percent. Medicaid makes health care available to individuals who otherwise could not afford it, by directly reimbursing nursing homes for Medicaid patient care. Typically, Medicaid reimbursement rates are set by a cost plus method, where <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> per patient is equal to average cost plus some return {{referred to as the}} Medicaid "plus" factor. This paper estimates the elasticity of Medicaid expenditures with respect to a change in the Medicaid "plus" factor,and decomposes that elasticity into price, quality, and quantity components. The decomposition is derived from a model of nursing home behavior, which shows that an increase in the Medicaid "plus" factor causes nursing homes to admit more Medicaid patients and reduce quality. Total expenditures are <b>the</b> Medicaid <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>times</b> <b>the</b> number of Medicaid patients receiving care. An increase in the Medicaid "plus" factor affects <b>the</b> Medicaid <b>reimbursement</b> by directly raising the Medicaid "plus" factor, and by indirectly decreasing average cost through a reduction in quality. These are the price and quality effects, respectively. The quantity effect is change in the number of Medicaid patients. The elasticities are estimated separately for proprietary and "not for profit" nursing homes using a 1980 sample of New York nursing homes. Uniformly, the proprietary elasticities are approximately twice as large as the "not for profit" elasticities. As expected the price and quantity effects are positive, and the quality effects are negative. In the decomposition, the quality effect is quite important. In fact, ignoring it would lead to a fifty-three percent overestimate of the Medicaid expenditure elasticity. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Act of 12 May 2011 on <b>the</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> of Medicines, Foodstuffs Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses and Medical Devices {{constitutes}} {{a major change}} of <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> policy in Poland. The main aims of this Act were to rationalize <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> policy and to reduce spending on reimbursed drugs. The Act seems to have met these goals: reimbursement policy (including pricing of reimbursed drugs) was overhauled and the expenditure of the National Health Fund on reimbursed drugs saw {{a significant decrease in}} the year following the Act's introduction. The annual savings achieved since then (mainly due to the introduction of risk sharing schemes), have made it possible to include new drugs into <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> list and improve access to innovative drugs. However, at the same time, the decrease in prices of reimbursed drugs, that the Act brought about, led to an uncontrolled outflow of some of these drugs abroad and shortages in Poland. This paper analyses the main changes introduced by <b>the</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> Act and their implications. Since the Act came into force relatively recently, its full impact on <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> policy is not yet possible to assess...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{requirements}} for <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilars and to compare <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> status, market share, and reimbursement costs of biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for <b>the</b> pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on <b>the</b> extent of <b>reimbursement</b> of biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets. Results: Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for <b>the</b> pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. <b>The</b> <b>reimbursement</b> rate of biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100 %. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares of expenditures on <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilar products ranged from 8. 0 % in Estonia in 2014 to 32. 4 % in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share of expenditures on reimbursement of biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest—for Croatia. Conclusions: The requirements for <b>the</b> pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> systems of these countries, and the expenditure on <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients...|$|R

Patient data were retrieved from the databases of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.

Before July 1, 2008, a proportionately {{higher level of}} subsidy was available for dental care in patients 65 years and above, but thereafter the system was changed, so that the subsidy was the same, regardless of the patient's age.

30|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} welfare loss {{effect of a}} change in <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> {{structure}} of a major nation-wide wage subsidy scheme for the disabled in Denmark that applied only to governmental units. We investigate empirically whether the changes in <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> amount affected <b>the</b> number and the share of all new Flexjob hires that are, respectively, hired out of non-employment vs. the number and share that are retained employees in governmental units compared to municipal/regional units. Descriptive evidence suggests that after the reform lowering the subsidy rate, governmental units were much less inclined to take in new hires as theory would suggest. Based on descriptive evidence and our empirical analysis, we find a substantial substitution between “insiders” and “outsiders” in both absolute and relative terms, showing that <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> reform in 2002 aimed only at governmental institutions for the purpose of reducing their incentives to hire Flexjob workers changed such firms’ preferences between hiring new Flexjob employees from non-employment and retaining existing employees.|$|R

The scheme was introduced in 1998 and targeted towards improving the employment prospects of the long-term (partially) disabled who had suffered a permanent reduction in their capacity to work but still retained some remaining work capacity. Under the scheme, firms received a salary reimbursement for both existing and new employees who were granted a Flexjob. Furthermore, eligible workers received the wage subsidy for the duration of their employment contract. In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> to governmental units was lowered while <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> to private, municipal and regional employers remained the same. Exploiting the exogenous variation arising from the change to <b>the</b> <b>reimbursement</b> structure applying to governmental units only, we analyze whether the differential shock in <b>the</b> wage <b>reimbursement</b> amount led to a different hiring response among governmental units compared to the remaining part of the public sector, i.e., municipal/regional firms. We investigate how the reform affected the number and the share of new Flexjobs made up of retained employees (insiders) versus non-employed hirees (outsiders) in the group of governmental units and in the comparison group. By retained employees, we mean those who were employed at the same firm prior to being found eligible for the wage subsidy.|$|R
