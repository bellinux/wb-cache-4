25|$|From 1346 {{ships were}} being built at Wearmouth, by a {{merchant}} named Thomas Menville. In 1589, salt {{was made in}} Sunderland. Large vats of seawater were heated using coal. As the water evaporated the salt remained. This process, known as salt panning, gave its name to Bishopwearmouth Panns; the modern-day name of the area <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> occupied is Pann's Bank, on the river bank between the city centre and the East End. As coal was required to heat the salt pans, a coal mining community began to emerge. Only poor quality coal was used in salt panning; quality coal was traded via the port, which subsequently began to grow.|$|E
