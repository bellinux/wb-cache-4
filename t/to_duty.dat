40|$|No {{one can be}} {{an expert}} in every area. In order to avoid {{wasteful}} duplication of effort, people generally rely on other members of society who expertise in that field. Yet reliance and trust pose risks for the trusting and dependent persons. When people notice such risks, they will either take extra steps to verify the truth or avoid the use of other people"s services. Eventually, the cost to both society and its members are likely to rise. However, recognition of fiduciary duties in entrusting relationship may facilitate reliance among members in society by reducing the risks for entrusting members. Although the current Korean Civil Code does not explicitly recognize fiduciary duties in agency and mandate relationship, agent and mandatee have <b>duties</b> similar <b>to</b> those of fiduciaries. However, {{considering the fact that}} agency and mandate relationships are based on reliance and trust between principal and agent or mandator and mandatee, the scope of mandatee"s <b>duties</b> need <b>to</b> be expanded. For example, mandatee currently has <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> account, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> delegate the fiduciary services <b>to</b> others, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> follow instructions, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> transfer objects acquired for mandator, and duty of care. However, the scope of mandatee"s <b>duties</b> need <b>to</b> be expanded <b>to</b> include <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> avoid self dealing, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> compete, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep confidential information, and <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep separate account. For the agent, Korean Civil Code imposes <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> avoid self dealing, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> compete, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> follow instructions, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> delegate the fiduciary services <b>to</b> others, and <b>duty</b> of care. This needs to be expanded <b>to</b> include <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> account, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep separate account, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep confidential information. However, recognition of general rules of fiduciary duties would not be required. In addition, the scope of fiduciary"s duties should be different based on characteristics of each entrusting relationships. Some fiduciary relationships are undoubtedly more intense than others. So the greater the independent authority to be exercised by the fiduciary, the greater the scope of his fiduciary duty. For instance, a trustee should be under a stricter duty of loyalty than an agent upon whom limited authority is conferred or a corporate director who can act only {{as a member of the}} board of directors. However, considering the fact that agency and mandate relationships are also entrusting, fiduciary, relationships which pose risks of abuse of power, these relationships should be subject to the fiduciary principle, although not to the same extent...|$|R

This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
