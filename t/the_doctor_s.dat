40|$|The {{assignment}} is designed as information material pertaining to controlled substances; addiction {{and a doctor}} s roll in situations involving substance abuse. The target group is medical students and doctors. In part 1 of the assignment we discuss different controlled substances, along with alcohol and potentially addictive medications. We include history, up-to-date statistics, types and routes of administration, pharmacology, short-term and long-term effects for each substance. Part 1 closes with a table describing symptoms of acute substance abuse. In part 2 we present an updated description of addition, while part 3 discusses a number of situations where one, as a doctor, must confront controlled substance abuse. There is focus on <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> role in prevention, role as a prescription drawer and the important support role in substitutions programs. Since alcohol is the most commonly abused psychoactive substance, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> roll in alcohol abuse is discussed in sub-section in part 3. By reviewing The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Tidskrift for den Norske Lægeforening), books and brochure material we have created {{a picture of what}} information is available and, more importantly, which information should have greater focus, especially concerning the Norwegian situation. As sources we have used a number of topic-summaries composed by well-known organisations such as; NIDA, Rusmiddeldirektoratet og Statens Rettstoksikologiske institutt. In discussions of various substances, if there was references to more specific information, in these cases we used a number of original sources...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women, and the {{incidence}} of the cancer is on the rise. However, public education and screening have permitted the detection of this disease at an early stage. This early presentation has open opportunities for physicians to offer therapeutic options tailored both to the individual&#x 2032;s disease process and the patient&#x 2032;s desires. There is an increased responsibility on <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> (<b>s)</b> to view an individual&#x 2032;s breast cancer as a subset of the disease, for which one or more treatment modalities may be combined. The combination is designed to deliver the best cure rates with the least risk of acute complications and late morbidity. This paper outlines the pathological determinants of breast cancer and their impact on the behavior of the disease. Algorithms are presented to view and manage the patient&#x 2032;s overall disease process. The subtleties in the medical literature on the management and clinical results of breast cancer are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis analyses doctors empathising with patients in palliative care interactions. Historically, palliative care has treated not only patients physical pain but their emotional pain, as well. Although the importance of empathy (defined {{for the purposes of}} this thesis as <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> expressed understanding of the patient s emotional experience) has been emphasised in this environment, however, there has been no prior research showing how palliative care doctors actually empathise with their patients in practice. Drawing upon 37 recordings of doctor-patient consultations collected in a UK hospice, this thesis addresses this omission by using conversation analysis (CA) to analyse several facets of empathy in this environment. The analysis begins in chapter four by considering the ways in which doctors can empathise with patients. It shows how doctors can empathise semantically, either by reworking what the patient has themselves said or by showing understanding on a normative basis. It also considers non-semantic ways of displaying empathy (e. g. response cries), showing how these are fundamentally different to the semantic type of empathic display. Overall, this chapter shows that empathy is not restricted to particular formats but, rather, is dependent upon the content of <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> turn. The analysis then moves on consider the wider context of doctors empathic responses. Chapter five, first of all, analyses cases where patients emotions become the topic of the interaction, either because the doctor asks about them directly or because the patient raises an emotionally-implicative topic. The emphasis here is on how palliative care doctors can talk to patients about, and empathise with, their emotions without necessarily having to do anything about those emotions. Chapter six then focuses on cases where patients emotions are discussed alongside the more task-driven aspects of the consultation, either because the patient s physical condition has had an emotional impact on them or because their presenting problem is inherently emotional. In contrast to chapter five, then, the source of the patient s emotions here can be treated by the doctor without the emotions being topicalised. The final two chapters of the analysis focus on doctors empathising with patients not in response to something that the patient has said but in the service of some task. Chapter seven shows how doctors can empathically bridge the gap between their medical and the patient s experiential perspectives at moments where it becomes clear that there is a disparity between the two. These include moments where the patient expresses expectations that go beyond what can realistically be provided, moments where the patient might take offence at <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> advice and moments where the doctor must reassure patients about their symptoms without seeming to criticise their emotional responses to those symptoms. Chapter eight, meanwhile, shows how doctors can empathically demonstrate that their practice is being driven by a due consideration of the patient s feelings. Specifically, it shows how doctors can draw upon patients feelings in helping them come to a decision about a treatment, cite those feelings when accounting for a treatment that they have recommended and frame a difficult topic as an outgrowth of sentiments that the patient has already expressed. In conclusion, this thesis shows how empathy is not clearly demarcated in palliative care. While there are cases where patients emotions are discussed and empathised with for the sake of discussing and empathising with them, more commonly, empathy and emotion are interwoven alongside and into the task-driven aspects of consultations. This thesis thus shows the interactional manifestation of palliative care s underlying philosophy, with patients emotional pain addressed alongside their physical pain in an integrated, holistic way...|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} whether {{the doctor in}} the private healthcare sector sees their professional identity as being under threat and how this impacts the interrelationships within the organisation in which they work. Healthcare in South Africa is a dynamic, growing industry, in which the private sector accounts for 52 % of the total spend, {{yet there is a}} disjoint in the relationship between hospital management and the doctor. To combat the trends of increasing costs, competition, customer expectations of quality care and a changing healthcare environment, the doctor and hospital need to improve this relationship. The research involves an exploratory study in the form of twelve doctor semi-structured interviews within the private health sector. A purposive sampling strategy is used to identify doctors who are typical of the identified population so as to gain representative perspectives. This study concludes that a professional identity threat to doctors currently exists. Insight is provided into those characteristics that doctors see as forming their identity and the sources of perceived threats to that identity.

40|$|Background Patients {{presenting}} {{with acute}} abdominal pain is a diagnostic {{challenge for the}} primary care physician. Although {{a large proportion of}} the illnesses are innocuous and self limiting, the possibility of encountering one of the infrequent and lethal disorders is always present. Not having sophisticated diagnostic equipment at hand in general practice makes strict demands on <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> judgement and clinical abilities. Objective We wanted to make a survey of conditions presenting as acute abdominal pain in general practice. Material and Methods Registration charts for acute abdominal pain were handed out to fifth year medical students from the University of Oslo having General Practice training. They reported patients receiving medical attention for acute abdominal pain, filling in information concerning pain duration, other symptoms, findings, tests, tentative diagnosis, further management and final diagnosis. Results and Interpretation 134 patients were reported with a median age of 33, 5 years and female majority. Pain was most frequently located to the epigastrium. Tenderness to palpation was the most frequent finding. An average of 1, 5 laboratory tests was performed per patient. 26 % of the patients were admitted to hospital and 16 % were referred to outpatient testing or evaluation. Pain duration equal or less than 24 hours predicted acute admission. Unspecific conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, non-specific abdominal pain), gynaecologic conditions and suspected appendicitis constitute the majority of the tentative and final diagnoses, around 38 % of the material, with several other ailments appearing infrequent. In this study we have got an outline of the field of interest. Further studies are needed as there are few studies published in the specific field of acute abdominal pain presenting in general practice...|$|E
40|$|Aim:The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to address the {{potential}} usefulness of Timed Barium Esophagogram (TBE) inperioperative management of patients with achalasia and to validate the TBE technique. Further aims of thisstudy was to characterize the clinical profile and health related {{quality of life of}} achalasia patients at the time ofthe first diagnosis and to compare short term efficacy of laparoscopic myotomy with pneumatic dilatation withrespect to clinical outcomes and to health economy perspectives. Methods:The present investigation incorporates 50 patients on whom TBE was performed and another 51 patients whowere randomized to laparoscopic myotomy or pneumatic dilatation. Evaluation was done by use of quality oflife, manometry and endoscopy. At TBE, 250 mL low-density barium was ingested and upright films at 1, 2 and 5 min pre- and postmyotomy were compared with regard to height and width of the barium column and relatedto symptoms. Pneumatic dilation was performed with balloon diameters of 30 - 40 mm and at the posterior partialfundoplication was added to the laparoscopic myotomy. Follow ups were scheduled at one, three, six and 12 months after inclusion. The patients were interviewed regarding symptoms; their quality of life and healtheconomy was also recorded prospectively. Results:Pre-myotomy regurgitation was more severe the higher the barium column (r- 0. 4, p< 0. 007). There was excellentintra and inter-observer agreement for all measured variables. The reproducibility of the static TBE variablesform day to day was good, but not so for the functional assessment of esophageal emptying. Most patientspresented with a long duration of symptoms (54 months). <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>s</b> delay amounted to 9 months despiteprofound swallowing difficulties (Watson score 30. 5 ± 1. 7). Quality of life was significantly impaired both whengeneric (PGWB) and disease specific (GSRS) instruments were applied. Surgery relieved symptoms in themajority of patients. Pneumatic dilatation strategy was associated with more treatment failures (p= 0. 047) duringthe 12 months follow up while overall cost of laparoscopic myotomy was found to be significantly highercompared to pneumatic dilation strategy (p= 0. 0002 and p = 0. 0019) due to the paramount costs charged duringthe actual operation. Conclusion:Timed Barium Esophagogram has the potential to give objective confirmation and information on the outcomeof respective therapeutic intervention. The inter-observer variability was generally small why TBE could well beincluded in the preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of all patients undergoing therapy forachalasia. Laparoscopic myotomy was found to be clinically superior to endoscopic balloon dilatation but isburdened by high initial costs, why the therapeutic method of choice still is under debate...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this is The Most Frequent Problems in Nursing Practice before and after Invasive Cardiological Interventions". The {{principal}} goals were to identify the most frequent problems in the nursing practice after invasive interventions, to map the awareness of patients before and after invasive interventions {{and the effect of}} awareness on further course of nursing care. The chapter describing {{the current state of the}} given problem also includes the history of invasive cardiology, describes some invasive interventions performed in the hospital and nursing. The latter is mainly focused on the role of a nurse in the care of patients undergoing invasive interventions and describes some nursing problems that may occur in these patients. The importance of communication between nursing staff and patients is highlighted. The qualitative inquiry took place in the form of non-standardized interviews and observation. The interviews were recorded on a dictaphone and transcribed subsequently. Two interviews, on which case reports were based, were made with 5 respondents in total. The case reports were completed with synoptic tables presenting the problems described in the case reports. The investigation took place at the standard Department of Cardiology of the České Budějovice Hospitál, Inc. The case reports include both interviews, before and after an invasive intervention, stating the most frequent problems of respondents.
