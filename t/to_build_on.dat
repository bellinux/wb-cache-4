5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> their {{successful}} 1997 season, {{and needed a}} four-game winning streak to close out the season at 8–8. The Giants strength was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense {{continued to be a}} disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E

His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he served up 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings.|$|E

5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> the character, {{and a number of}} scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E

5|$|Despite a new-look, {{much younger}} team and an 8–1 win over Walsall, Bolton's best league win for 50 years, Bolton {{failed to win}} {{promotion}} in the 1983–84 season, and would remain in the Third Division for another three seasons. In 1986 Nat Lofthouse was appointed President of the football club, a position he would hold until his death on 15 January 2011. At {{the end of the}} 1986–87 season, Bolton Wanderers suffered relegation to the Fourth Division {{for the first time in}} their history, but won promotion back to the Third Division at the first attempt. The club won the Sherpa Van Trophy in 1989, defeating Torquay United 4–1. During the 1990–91 season, Bolton were pipped to the final automatic promotion place by Southend United and lost to Tranmere Rovers in the play-off final, but they failed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> this and the following season saw the club finish 13th.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne hoped <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>on</b> {{the success}} of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E
