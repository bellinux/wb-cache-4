500|$|After Howe's {{first year}} in Halifax, {{engineering}} instruction of upperclassmen was taken away from Dalhousie and other universities in the province, {{and placed in a}} separate technical institute in which Howe had no role. Howe later stated that he liked Dalhousie, and had this change not occurred, he might have remained there as a professor. In 1913, however, a former colleague at Dalhousie, Robert Magill, who had recently been appointed chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, offered Howe the post of chief engineer, with responsibility for supervising the construction of grain elevators. Howe stated, [...] "I've never seen one of those <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but I'll take the job." [...] The same year, he applied to become a British subject, as Canadians then were.|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 led to Andersen's life once more taking a turn into illegal activities. His furniture workshop {{was used as}} a weapons depot by the Norwegian resistance movement, and he took part in looting German military stores. He was first arrested by the Germans after he had responded to rumours that he was a Nazi by writing the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk and stating that [...] "although I have done many wrong <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> a Nazi I am not. Yours sincerely Johs. S. Andersen". The letter was published unedited by the newspaper, although Andersen was later arrested by the occupying authorities and sentenced to one year in prison, after spending half a year in detention. Using techniques he had learned during his earlier criminal career, Andersen managed to be transferred to prison hospital during his time in detention. While there he acquired false x-ray images and tuberculosis germs to fake illnesses in other captured resistance men who {{were on their way to}} interrogation. He also infected a German interrogator with malaria by contaminating his insulin. At night, he would sneak out of the hospital and operate in Oslo, amongst other activities breaking into Nasjonal Samling offices and stealing documents, copying them and having them shipped to the United Kingdom together with evidence of torture in Nazi-run prisons. He served the last part of his sentence in Fuhlsbüttel near Hamburg, Germany. [...] His wife was also active in resistance work, dealing with propaganda and espionage. Author Egil Ulateig doubts the veracity of Andersen's prison exploits, which are based mostly on Andersen's own testimony.|$|E

60|$|And once (though it is {{the most}} {{incidental}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life)</b> I murdered a man....|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{did such}} a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>my</b> dear fellow--it's against my {{internal}} regulations. But {{how have you been}} since the week before next month?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I had {{went through}} a lot of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E
6000|$|Dorian Gray {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I {{am not going}} to do any more. I began my good actions yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} of such a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> never!" [...] he said at last. [...] "You have told me the facts. Now tell me your inferences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] he said distinctly. [...] "I {{want you}} to go with me to Loon Lake {{tomorrow}} more than I ever wanted any <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't fit {{to think}} of her," [...] he groaned. [...] "I never did a decent <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> as they say. But how can I give her up--God, how can I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't do {{anything}} with him at all,' he said angrily. 'I've never heard such <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> He's either mad or he's got {{into the hands of}} the Dissenters. That's the only explanation I can offer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've done a {{good many}} rash and foolish <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but I don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You didn’t lose much; {{he was too}} mean to live. I’ve done certain <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that I’ve never understood; {{no wonder}} others can’t do much with them. But that’s all over! Are you sure Max doesn’t hear?” she asked quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It cannot be!" [...] cried Muir, {{his face}} {{flushing}} equally with indignation and shame; [...] "it cannot be, Adjutant; for I never did so awkward a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I {{appeal to the}} ladies for a juster judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} of such a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Not love him! And why shouldn't you love him? He's a gentleman. Everybody respects him. He'll have plenty to make you {{comfortable}} all your life! And then why didn't you tell me before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall {{do nothing}} of the sort, Chester," [...] cried Lady Brandon. [...] "I never {{heard of such a}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life!</b> Do you pay us for the wall and fence your people have broken, Mr. Smilash; that would be more to the purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How dare you?" [...] she gasped. [...] "I’ve {{never said}} such <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Never. And I {{said that she}} left because Mr. Wilson, her master, was dead and the family had gone to London. I’ve never been near the house; so how could I say such things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so--some day--and yet I do not know. There are strange <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> Miss Thurwell, {{which every}} now and then rise up and drive me away into aimless wanderings. Life has no goal for me--it cannot have. I stand for ever {{on the brink of a}} precipice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are lots}} of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that I have never told you," [...] replied Jacob with a little secret smile. [...] "For instance, once I mesmerized you, {{although}} you did not know it, {{and that is why}} you always have to do what I want you to, except when your daughter is near you, for her influence is stronger than mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> to be ashamed of," [...] said he, and his hair {{bristled}} up with anger until he looked like an old cockatoo. [...] "You know best what that is. It is a mistake which has brought its own punishment with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--nor should I. I {{never did}} such a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before. But as he was there I had to show that I was not ashamed of him! Do you think I {{should have done it}} if you all had not been there?" [...] Then again she burst into tears.|$|R
5000|$|Howard is a Christian and has said, [...] "The most {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> is Christ. He's {{more important to}} me than winning or losing or whether I'm playing or not. Everything else is just a bonus." [...] He is also involved with Athletes in Action, a ministry arm of Campus Crusade for Christ.|$|R
6000|$|Everything {{seemed to}} be {{slipping}} away from me. I pushed on to the ugly facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation. [...] "What has held me back," [...] I said, [...] "is the thought {{that you could not}} possibly understand certain <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Men are not pure as women are. I have had love affairs. I mean I have had affairs. Passion--desire. You see, I have had a mistress, I have been entangled--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Louis," [...] I said, [...] "you know me only in London, where I {{come and}} sit in your {{restaurant}} and eat and drink there. To you I am simply like all those others who come to you day by day,--idlers and pleasure seekers. Let me assure you, Louis, {{that there are other}} <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Just now I should welcome anything in the world which meant adventure, which could teach me to forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And more still I have to say, ere it {{is again}} too late," [...] I returned. [...] "I have done many strange <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> many things that wiser men would not have dared, but never in my wildest fancies have I dreamed of winning a Dejah Thoris for myself--for never had I dreamed that in all the {{universe}} dwelt such a woman as the Princess of Helium. That you are a princess does not abash me, but that you are you {{is enough to make}} me doubt my sanity as I ask you, my princess, to be mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take them to Nancy Shott!" [...] cried Willy. [...] "I {{never heard}} of such a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life!</b> She's able to buy {{blankets}}, dozens of them if she wants them, and to take to her such blankets as the ones you brought from California,--why it takes my breath away to think of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are both}} of you crazy. I never stole a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Let go, {{both of you}}!" [...] And then the man began to {{struggle}} fiercely, finally pushing the party in the hallway backward, and almost sending Walter headlong as he darted down the tenement steps and continued his flight along the side street.|$|R
60|$|He said I {{should never}} regret a <b>thing</b> more <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> than going without that camera.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not I, Marjory,' said he; 'if {{there is}} {{anything}} in a clear conscience, not I. I offer all my heart's best affection; {{you can take it}} or want it, though I suspect it's beyond either your power or mine to change what has once been done, and set me fancy-free. I'll marry you, if you like; but I tell you again and again, it's not worth while, and we had best stay friends. Though I am a quiet man I have noticed a heap of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Trust in me, and take things as I propose; or, if you don't like that, say the word, and I'll marry you out of hand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{can safely}} say that few <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> have pleased {{me more than}} the request of Messrs. Trübner, backed by the {{expressed}} wish of the author, that I would see the first English edition of the [...] "Biglow Papers" [...] through the press. I fell in with the Papers about ten years ago, soon after their publication; and the impression they then made on me has been deepening and becoming more lively ever since. In fact, I do not think that, even in his own New England, Mr. Lowell can have a more constant or more grateful reader, though I cannot say that I go much beyond most of my own intimate friends over here in my love for his works. I may remark, in passing, that the impossibility of keeping {{a copy of the}} [...] "Biglow Papers" [...] {{for more than a few}} weeks (of which many of us have had repeated and sorrowful proof[1]) shows how much an English Edition is needed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never a jest do I speak," [...] quoth Robin. [...] "Come, strip thy jacket off and I {{will show}} thee, for I tell thee I like thy clothes well. Moreover, I will {{be kind to}} thee, for I will feast {{straightway}} upon the good things thou hast with thee, and thou shalt be bidden to the eating." [...] At these words he began slipping off his doublet, and the Cobbler, seeing him so in earnest, began pulling off his clothes also, for Robin Hood's garb tickled his eye. So each put on the other fellow's clothes, and Robin gave the honest Cobbler ten bright new shillings. Quoth merry Robin, [...] "I ha' been a many <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before, but never have I been an honest cobbler. Come, friend, let us fall to and eat, for something within me cackles aloud for that good fat capon." [...] So both sat down and began to feast right lustily, {{so that when they}} were done the bones of the capon were picked as bare as charity.|$|E
40|$|I am very {{grateful}} for the great supervising of Sjoerd de Haan and Frans Pansier.

50|$|My {{relationship}} with Christ is hands-down {{the most important}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{and the reason for}} being...My inspiration comes through daily experiences and my pursuit of Christ's character. There are days that are extremely challenging with certain projects or paintings, but it's on these days that I get to learn more about myself and what God wants to accomplish through me.|$|R
5000|$|In the song, [...] "Si Tuviera Que Decirlo" [...] (If I {{had to say}} it), about love, Fernández adopts {{the romantic}} aspect that has {{characterized}} his artistic career, with lyrics such as: [...] "If I had to say it, I {{would like to say}} I love you, you are the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> you are the air I breathe".|$|R
