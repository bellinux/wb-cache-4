However, he is infected, and rather than allow himself {{to turn into a}} Thing, Pierce shoots himself in the head. Blake continues to pursue the man with the radio, eventually discovering that he is a Thing. Blake kills him, and takes the radio. Moving on, he enters the [...] "Pyron" [...] sub-facility beneath the Norwegian base, learning of a company called Gen-Inc., who have installed a research team under the command of Dr. Sean Faraday (John Carpenter). Gen-Inc. had been conducting biological experiments on the Things when their team was infected, and now only a few survivors remain within the facility. Blake rescues Faraday and attempts to leave. However, he is prevented from doing so by Whitley, who shoots him with a <b>tranquillizer</b> gun, and reveals to Faraday that he has infected himself with the Thing gene, claiming it to be controllable, something of which he is living proof, and therefore demonstrating its capability as a weapon. When Faraday attempts to eradicate the Thing virus, Whitley kills him.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, poor Don Carlos {{remained}} incarcerated in the Imperial prison, and {{preparations for}} war {{went on with}} vigour and activity, both in Andorra and Guatemala. Naturally, the greatest excitement prevailed throughout Europe, {{and especially in the}} sympathetic Republic of San Marino. Very different views of the situation were expressed by the various periodicals of that effusive State. The Matutinal Agitator declared that Andorra under the Obrienelli dynasty had become a dangerously aggressive Power, and that no peace could be expected in Europe until the Andorrans had been taught to recognize their true position in the scale of nations. The Vespertinal Sentimentalist, on the other hand, looked upon the Guatemalans as wanton disturbers of the public quietude, and considered Andorra in the favourable light of an oppressed nationality. The Hebdomadal <b>Tranquillizer,</b> which treated both sides with contempt--avowing that it held the Andorrans to be little better than lawless brigands, in the last stage of bankruptcy; and the Guatemalans to be mere drunken half-castes, incapable of attack or defence for want of men and money--this lukewarm and mean-spirited journal, I say, was treated with universal contumely as a wretched time-server, devoid of human sympathies and of proper cosmopolitan expansiveness. At length, however, through the good offices of the San Marino Government, both Powers were induced to lay aside the thought of needless bloodshed, and to discuss the terms of a mutual understanding at a Pan-Hispanic Congress to be held in the neutral metropolis of Monaco.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>tranquillizer</b> gun (also spelled {{tranquilizer}} gun or tranquilliser gun), capture gun or dart gun, is a non-lethal air gun {{often used}} for incapacitating animal targets via projectile injection of anesthetic chemicals usually referred as tranquilizers. [...] These guns shoot darts with a hypodermic needle tip, filled with a dose of tranquilizer solution that is either sedative, comatosing or paralytic, which once injected will temporarily impair the target's physical function to a level that allows it to be approached and handled in an unresisting and thus safe manner. <b>Tranquillizer</b> guns {{have a long history}} of use to capture wildlife without risking serious injuries to both the hunter and the target. <b>Tranquillizer</b> darts can also be fired by crossbow or breath-powered blowgun.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tranquillizer</b> darts are not {{generally}} included in military or police less-than-lethal arsenals because no drug is yet known {{that would be}} quickly and reliably effective on humans without the risks of side effects or an overdose. This means that effective use requires {{an estimate of the}} weight of the target to be able to determine how many darts (if any) can be used. Shooting too few would result in partial effects only, while too many can kill the target. According to James Butts, former Chief of Police of Santa Monica, [...] "Tranquilizing agents don't affect everyone uniformly. Therefore you cannot predict whether or not you have a sufficient dose to tranquilize the individual. Second, any <b>tranquillizer</b> will take time to enter the bloodstream and sedate the individual. If someone is advancing on you with a deadly weapon or a threatening object, there's no way a <b>tranquillizer</b> would take effect in the two to three seconds it would take someone to seriously injure you." ...|$|E

All the ionization energies obtained lie in the range 7. 0 - 8. 4 eV. The phenothiazines are thus strong electron donors, in agreement with calculations. There is little difference in ionization energies and equilibrium constants of complex formation between <b>tranquillizers</b> and either non-tranquillizers or timulants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between the Swedish underprivileged area score and sales of <b>tranquillizers,</b> hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics and antidepressants, and {{the correlation between}} these sales and mortality and suicide rates, with the aim of using sales data to identify areas with poor socioeconomic conditions. SETTING: Southern Sweden, 33 municipalities in Skane, 1987 and 1994. DESIGN: Ecological study. Determined and undetermined cases of suicide were taken from the local death register for the years 1987 - 1993. Suicide rates (determined and undetermined cases) were calculated as the ratio between observed and expected number of suicides. Mortality for people aged 20 - 64 years was calculated from life tables for the decade 1981 - 1990. The underprivileged area score was calculated for municipalities using the proportion of persons in the following groups: elderly living alone, under 5 years of age, one-parent families, unskilled, unemployed, living in crowded households, those moving house in the previous year, and ethnic groups. After transformation (square root of arc sine) and standardization, each of the eight variables was weighted by the British general practitioners average weighting and added to give the underprivileged area score. The selection of the eight variables was based on general practitioners' perceptions of the effect of the social characteristics of the populations in their respective residential areas on their workload or pressure on services. The total drug sales figures for <b>tranquillizers,</b> hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics and antidepressants are expressed in Defined Daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day. The relationship between these variables was analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There was a moderate correlation (0. 41 - 0. 68) between the sales expressed as in Defined Daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day of <b>tranquillizers</b> and hypnotics/sedatives and underprivileged area score. Furthermore, the sales of <b>tranquillizers</b> and hypnotics/sedatives seemed to be moderately correlated with both mortality (0. 44 - 0. 67) and suicide (0. 47 - 0. 58). CONCLUSION: Sales of <b>tranquillizers</b> or hypnotics/sedatives could be used with caution as markers for socioeconomic conditions {{on the basis of their}} moderate ecological correlation with a composite socioeconomic index such as the Swedish underprivileged area score and their moderate correlation with mortality and suicide...|$|R

In order to study this further, all prescriptions for psychotropic medications to non-hospitalized inhabitants of the capital city (Reykjavík) and dispensed by pharmacists there during 1 month in 1984, 1989 and 1993 were analysed in order to estimate the 1 -month prevalence of psychopharmacological use. The results support the hypothesis partly as prescriptions for <b>tranquillizers</b> decreased in 1989 as well as the amount of <b>tranquillizers</b> and hypnotics prescribed following new restrictions, whereas the prevalence odds ratio of obtaining prescriptions for hypnotics remained unchanged. The proportion of patients receiving excessive amounts of <b>tranquillizers</b> and/or hypnotics decreased. The prevalence of excessive use of these drugs (i. e. > 90 DDD/month) was 0. 5 % in 1993. In 1993 the prevalence of the use of antidepressants as well as the amount prescribed had increased substantially following the introduction of the new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications.
