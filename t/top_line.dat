5|$|At forward, Kassian {{began the}} {{year on the}} <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with the Sedin twins. Kassian scored five goals in the first seven games of the season. Partway through the Canucks' second game of February, Kassian was {{replaced}} on the <b>top</b> <b>line</b> by Alexandre Burrows. Kassian was dropped to the third line. Despite Kassian surpassing his goal total from his rookie season, the Sedins started the year with their lowest output in nearly ten years, combining for 14 {{points in the first}} 10 games. Coinciding with the line changes, Vancouver went on a six-game winning streak between the end of January and their February 12 game. After the last game of their winning streak, the Canucks were expecting Kesler to return to line-up.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{spent much}} of the 2015–16 season playing on the Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with the Sedin twins, {{following}} a 5–3 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on 10 November 2015 which saw the line tally 11 points.

5|$|Daniel {{recorded}} 74 {{points in}} 2007–08, as the Canucks missed {{the playoffs for}} the second time in three years. He finished second in team point-scoring to Henrik and first in goals with 29. The Sedins saw some time with Näslund on their <b>top</b> <b>line</b> during the season to form an all-Swedish forward unit. The following season, Daniel recorded 31 goals and 82 points, tying Henrik for the team lead in points. He opened the campaign being named the NHL's First Star of the Week on 13 October 2008, with a five-point effort over two games. Steve Bernier had been acquired in the 2008 off-season in another trade with the Sabres, and began the season on the <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with the Sedins. Bernier was later removed; on 12 February 2009, Head Coach Alain Vigneault moved Alexandre Burrows up from the third line during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. Late in the campaign, Daniel was named the NHL's Second Star of the Week on 30 March 2009, after recording four goals and four assists in four games, including a game-winning goal. He added ten points over ten games in the 2009 playoffs, helping the Canucks advance to the second round, where they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks.|$|E
5|$|During {{training}} camp in September 1995, Islanders head coach Mike Milbury heralded Bertuzzi as the team's best performing forward. Making his NHL debut on October 7, 1995, he scored a wrap around goal against goaltender Blaine Lacher in a 4–4 tie with the Boston Bruins. Beginning the season on the team's <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Zigmund Palffy and Travis Green, Bertuzzi finished his rookie year with 18 goals and 39 points over 76 games. The following season, Bertuzzi recorded 23 points in 64 games. The Islanders did not qualify for the playoffs in either of his two full seasons with the club, ranking second-last in the Eastern Conference in 1995–96 and 1996–97.|$|E
5|$|Free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in two seasons, Bure was one of the Panthers' {{offensive}} leaders in 2003–04. He reached 20 goals for the fifth time in his NHL career, and as the season's trade deadline approached, was Florida's leading scorer with 45 points. However, as the Panthers were out of playoff contention, they traded Bure to the Dallas Stars on March 9, 2004, in exchange for Drew Bagnall and a draft pick. Bure was placed on the Stars' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, and he recorded 7 points in 13 games to conclude the regular season. Bure added three assists in five playoff games.|$|E

5|$|In 2003–04, Morrison {{registered}} 22 {{goals and}} 60 points over 82 games as {{all members of}} the Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> experienced declines in offensive production. Bertuzzi was replaced on Morrison's wing after he was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for sucker punching Steve Moore in a game against Colorado in March 2004; he was replaced on the Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> by Matt Cooke. Nonetheless, the Canucks won their first-ever Northwest Division title and went into the 2004 playoffs as the West's third seed. Facing elimination in game six of the opening round against the Calgary Flames, Morrison scored there minutes into the contest's third overtime session to force a seventh game. Having skated from the corner boards with the puck, Morrison stickhandled across the net and scored past Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. The Canucks were then eliminated in Game 7; Morrison finished the playoff season with five points. Becoming a restricted free agent in the off-season, he filed for salary arbitration against the Canucks {{for the second time in}} two years. Both sides managed to avoid their hearing by agreeing to a one-year deal on July 27, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 2009–10 season, Burrows left {{during a}} game against the Los Angeles Kings after being hit in the throat by a Jarret Stoll slapshot. He was not injured, however, and did not miss any games thereafter. Playing a full season on the Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with the Sedins, he {{recorded}} a career-high 35 goals, 32 assists, 67 points and a +34 rating. His goals total ranked first on the Canucks. Fans voted him as recipient of the team's Most Exciting Player Award for the third consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|The Coyotes signed Langkow to a one-year, $2.95 million {{contract}} in August 2004, but dealt {{him to the}} Calgary Flames {{less than two weeks}} later for Oleg Saprykin and Denis Gauthier. The season, and the contract, were wiped out by the 2004–05 NHL lockout; Langkow did not play anywhere during the lost season. The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005–06 season amidst high expectations as he was placed on the <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Jarome Iginla. He finished the season second on the Flames in both goals (25) and points (59) and recorded his sixth consecutive season with 50+ points.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Raymond {{made the}} Canucks' roster out {{of training camp}} and made his NHL debut on the team's <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. He picked up his first NHL point, an assist, in the season-opener against the San Jose Sharks on October 5, 2007. Soon thereafter, he was sent down to the Moose for a two-day assignment after having been a healthy scratch. He returned to the Canucks on October 18, 2007, and was later returned to the Moose {{at the end of}} the month for a longer assignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Bure debuted at {{the world}} under-20 level as a 17-year-old at the 1989 World Junior Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. The <b>top</b> <b>line</b> of CSKA Moscow teammates Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Fedorov led the Soviet Union to a gold medal. Bure's eight goals tied him for the tournament lead with Jeremy Roenick of the United States; he led the Soviet team with 14 points. He {{was named to the}} Tournament All-Star Team, and earned Best Forward honours. He again participated in the 1989 European Junior Championship, helping the Soviet Union win the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|While Burrows' {{offensive}} numbers {{increased from}} {{playing on the}} <b>top</b> <b>line,</b> the Sedins' mutually benefitted from playing with him. Daniel and Henrik {{had not had a}} constant linemate on the first line since Anson Carter played with them in 2005–06. Since then, Vigneault had used a variety of wingers, including Markus Naslund, Taylor Pyatt and Steve Bernier, to fill in the unit. In those years, Daniel and Henrik were point-a-game players; with Burrows on their line, they vaulted into top scorers in the league, as Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading point-getter (Daniel scored at a similar pace, but played less due to an injury).|$|E

5|$|After {{beginning}} the 1998–99 {{season on the}} Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line,</b> Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, {{the first of which}} was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by The Vancouver Sun to be worth a little over $2 million.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} of Bertuzzi for the {{remainder}} of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the <b>top</b> <b>line</b> by Matt Cooke. The Canucks' division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six seconds left in the game. Despite the effort, Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.|$|E
5|$|For a franchise-record seventh {{consecutive}} season, {{he led the}} Canucks in scoring, with 32goals and 79points. Despite new NHL rules set {{in place}} after the lockout that sought to allow skilled players such as Näslund and his linemates to thrive, all {{three members of the}} Canucks' <b>top</b> <b>line</b> saw decreased offensive production in 2005–06. Furthermore, the Canucks failed to make the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four seasons, finishing at ninth place in the Western Conference, despite early-season projections to be Stanley Cup contenders. Consequently, significant changes to the Canucks' personnel were made in the off-season. Of particular significance to Näslund, longtime linemate Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, while Alain Vigneault replaced Marc Crawford with a more defensive-minded coaching approach. Crawford later recalled the 2005–06 season as a turning point in Näslund's role as the offensive leader on the team, noting that Henrik and Daniel Sedin had surpassed him and Bertuzzi in that respect as the campaign progressed.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interplant}} distance on differentiation and selection a) {{of the superior}} lines from a mixture of inbred lines, and b) of individual plants originating from the <b>top</b> <b>lines,</b> was studied in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.). For this, 28 chickpea inbred lines were evaluated on a single plant basis in a honeycomb design {{and in the same}} field at three interplant distances, for four growing seasons, at Larissa, Greece. The interplant distances were 15 cm (520000 plants/ha, strong allo-competition), 30 cm (128630 plants/ha, medium allo-competition) and 100 cm (11500 plants/ha, without competition). In addition, the inbred lines were evaluated in replicated plot trials under an agronomically accepted plant stand (520000 plants/ha, crop environment) and the ranking of the 28 lines based on the average yield per plot over growing seasons was determined. Selection was applied in each season for each interplant distance and the three and six <b>top</b> <b>lines</b> with the highest average yield per plant were identified. These <b>top</b> <b>lines</b> from each interplant distance were compared with the three and six <b>top</b> <b>lines</b> (say: proven superior lines) identified after their evaluation under crop environment over seasons. In addition, selection was applied at the individual plant level with six selection pressures in each season and each interplant distance. Then we determined for each experiment and selection pressure the number of the selected plants which belonged to the six proven <b>top</b> <b>lines.</b> It was observed that the ranking obtained under crop environment was best correlated with the ranking at the intermediate interplant distance (30 cm), followed by the ranking at the high interplant distance (100 cm). In contrast this correlation was very weak for the ranking at low interplant distance (15 cm). In addition, the interplant distance identifying the highest number of the proven high yielding lines after their evaluation in one season was the intermediate interplant distance followed by the high interplant distance and certainly not the low interplant distance. The relative effectiveness was further increased when selection was based on average performance of the lines across seasons. This, together with the relatively small number of seeds produced per plant, renders selection at low interplant distance less favorable than selection at the intermediate or high interplant distance. The individual plant selection was effective at all three interplant distances. Selection effectiveness generally increased as the selection pressure increased. Again the best results were obtained when selection was applied at intermediate or at high interplant distance. It was concluded that line selection as well as individual plant selection was more effective at intermediate interplant distance and certainly not at low interplant distance...|$|R
5|$|In January 2004, he {{was voted}} by league fans to the {{starting}} lineup of the NHL All-Star Game. Representing the Western Conference alongside Näslund and Canucks head coach Marc Crawford, they were defeated by the East 6–4. Bertuzzi had two assists while playing on a line with Näslund and Joe Sakic. Nearing {{the end of the}} 2003–04 season, Bertuzzi was indefinitely suspended by the NHL for punching Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind during a game on March 8, 2004. His actions were a retaliation to a hit from Moore on Näslund during a previous game. Sitting out the remainder of the regular season and playoffs due to his suspension, he finished 2003–04 with 60 points over 69 games. Vancouver replaced Bertuzzi on the team's <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Matt Cooke and went on to their first Northwest Division title, before being eliminated {{in the first round of}} the 2004 playoffs by the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to {{the next}} Winter Olympics, Kariya was chosen as one of eight initial players to Canada's roster on March 23, 2001. Playing on the <b>top</b> <b>line</b> with Mario Lemieux, Kariya scored three goals and one assist over six games, tying for fourth in Canadian point-scoring. He {{registered}} his first goal of the tournament in Canada's second game, a 3–2 win against Germany. His second came against Belarus in the semi-final, qualifying Canada for the gold medal game. Playing the United States in the final, Kariya scored Canada's first goal of the game, tying the score at 1–1 in the first period. Canada {{went on to win}} 5–2, capturing their first Olympic gold medal since 1952. Canada's roster was later inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame under the team category on March 26, 2009, during a ceremony in Vancouver.|$|E

The second, a 3–0 loss to the Florida Panthers, ended with Flames fans loudly booing the team as it left the ice. Three more players were lost to injury, Raitis Ivanans and Rene Bourque (head injuries) and Adam Pardy (shoulder), while the team's top scoring line of Jarome Iginla, Olli Jokinen and Alex Tanguay was held pointless. The team's early struggles resulted in a lengthy meeting between the players and coaches about the team's need to compete harder. The team responded to the meeting with a stronger effort in a 5–3 victory over the Oilers in which Iginla and Tanguay scored their first goals of the season alongside Matt Stajan, who took Jokinen's spot on the <b>top</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
