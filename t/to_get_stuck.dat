Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck.</b> Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck.</b> NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond {{more to the}} {{distress}} calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, {{and the length of}} the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E

5000|$|Striate arteries or ganglionic arteries {{arise from}} the middle {{cerebral}} artery and supply deep structures in the cerebrum, including the internal capsule and reticular formation. Strokes in these vessels are common and can cause extensive damage.

50|$|The huge wheels were {{intended}} to cross significant obstacles. However, due to miscalculations of the weight, the rear wheel was prone <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in soft ground and ditches, and the front wheels were sometimes insufficient to pull it out. This led to a fiasco of tests before the high commission in August 1915. The tank remained in the location where it was tested, some 60 kilometres from Moscow until 1923 when it was finally taken apart for scrap.|$|R
25|$|The {{challenge}} for the designers of DualDisc was to produce a dual-sided disc which was not too thick to play reliably in slot-loading drives, while the CD side was not too thin to be tracked easily by the laser.

25|$|Like most early tanks, the Schneider {{was built}} like a simple {{armoured}} box, without compartmentalisation of the inner space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck.</b> Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement".
