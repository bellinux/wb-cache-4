5000|$|Several Lathyrus species grow here, {{such as the}} <b>tuberous</b> <b>pea,</b> {{which is}} rare in Denmark, and the {{relatively}} rare marsh pea.|$|E
50|$|Other {{species are}} grown for food, {{including}} the Indian pea (L. sativus) {{and the red}} pea (L. cicera), and less commonly Cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The <b>tuberous</b> <b>pea</b> (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.|$|E
50|$|Bruchus are specialists, {{feeding and}} {{developing}} {{almost exclusively on}} plants of the legume tribe Fabeae (Vicieae), which includes peas, sweet peas, lentils, and vetches. Examples include cow vetch (Vicia cracca), which is attacked by at least nine Bruchus species, common vetch (Vicia sativa), which is host to five recorded species, and meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and <b>tuberous</b> <b>pea</b> (Lathyrus tuberosus), which are each attacked by four species. Some Bruchus species are monophagous, living on just one host plant species.|$|E
50|$|Lathyrus tuberosus, {{also known}} as the <b>{{tuberous}}</b> <b>pea,</b> tuberous vetchling, earthnut pea, or aardaker, is a small, climbing perennial plant, native in moist temperate parts of Europe and Western Asia. The plant is a trailer or weak climber, supported by tendrils, growing to 1.2 m tall. The leaves are pinnate, with two leaflets and a branched twining tendril at the apex of the petiole. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, pollinated by bees. The plants can also spread vegetatively from the root system.|$|E
