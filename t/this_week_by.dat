25|$|Every spring, Fairport {{students}} celebrate Brotherhood/Sisterhood Week. The week {{is focused}} around Civility, Awareness, Respect, and Embrace (CARE). The event is most prominent at FHS, where a different activity takes place {{each day of}} the week. Monday is Family Talk Day, during which a student and an adult are selected to speak to the students. Tuesday consists of a presentation during which student voices writings are read. The writings anonymously tell students' feelings about CARE. On Wednesday, a community member is asked to speak. On Wednesday of the 2007 celebration, Rachel's Challenge visited the school. The program encouraged students to improve the atmosphere of their school. The program impacted the students in a large way, partly because they had lost a beloved member of the student body the night before. Wednesday is also the annual Junior-4th Grade walk. The district's 4th and 11th graders walk the village streets together to build relationships with each other. Thursday's program is known as Unplugged, and is a non-stop musical performance available to students with free periods or lunch. Friday concludes the eventful week with Outreach Day. On this day, the entire school is bused to the three elementary schools. Students meet with their new little brothers and sisters for an hour. They play games and teach them about CARE. A song written about <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> former students Sean Lyness, John Cieply, Pat Dupont, and David Lachance is played yearly.|$|E

He thought that [...] "the best moment <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>by</b> far, had to be that big, fat wink to Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (and West Wing, and Sports Night..., where Liz and Pete, upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle {{over the course of a}} banter exchange, shrugged and said, 'Nice walk-and-talk', and then bumped fists.

500|$|Although filmed {{to create}} the {{illusion}} that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a [...] "surreptitious cut" [...] helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of the series required 800 to 1,200 film cuts, but [...] "X-Cops" [...] only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the X-Files logo to appear {{at any time during the}} episode. He stressed that he wanted [...] "X-Cops" [...] to feel like an [...] "episode of Cops that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." [...] The network, fearing that people would not understand that [...] "X-Cops" [...] was actually an episode of The X-Files, vetoed this idea. A compromise was reached wherein the episode would open with the Cops theme song, but the normal X-Files credits would scroll after an opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue lights flashing across The X-Files logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the Cops logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of The X-Files to prevent watchers from thinking that the show [...] "has been preempted <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> Cops".|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, [...] "Louis Theroux is out-oddballed <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> {{the subject}} of his latest {{documentary}} ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are." [...] Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were [...] "... wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out of it than Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are." [...] Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, [...] "A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux." ...|$|E
