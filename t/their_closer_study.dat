Title of diploma thesis: Enzymatic {{activity}} of recombinant enzymes. Evaluation of His- tag influence. AKR 1 B 1, AKR 1 C 1 and AKR 1 C 3 are three representatives from 15 human enzymes of AKR superfamily, so far described. In the body they {{take part in}} a number of biochemical pathways and their substrates include both xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Reduction of glucose to sorbitol catalyzed by AKR 1 B 1 is associated with the development of secondary diabetic complications. AKR 1 B 1 is also involved in cardiotoxic effect of the cytostatic drug daunorubicine. AKR 1 C 1 is physiologically responsible for the conversion of progesterone to less efficient 20 α- hydroxyprogesterone, thereby regulates progestational activity. Overexpression of AKR 1 C 1 may be connected with resistance to certain cytostatic agents. AKR 1 C 3 in human catalyzes a reaction in which testosterone and 5 α-DHT is formed and it is also associated with development of several cancer types. Significant involvement of these enzymes in a number of pathological processes led to <b>their</b> <b>closer</b> <b>study.</b> The aim of this work was to evaluate influence of His-tag and chosen buffer on the [...] ...|$|E

Future de-signs may draw upon cognitive theories of categoriza-tion and metaphor to understand how users interact with text-both paper and electronic. Relevant literature in cognitive psychology and information science sug-gests {{the importance of the}} user’s physical environment in thinking about abstract entities, such as categories of documents. Empirical studies have established a ba-sis for understanding how we think about, file, remem-ber, and locate text. Results from a study of 20 historians-an exemplary group in terms of <b>their</b> <b>close</b> <b>studies</b> of texts and the broad scope of their inquiries-imply the importance of metaphors for storage and re-trieval of documents. The study found that metaphors and subjective categories were frequently applied to documents collected and created by these scholars. Two physical factors-spatial configuration and docu-ment form-were often considered before topic in deter-mining document storage locations in the office. Developers of information systems should consider qualitative aspects of cognition in their designs. System developers might also consider segmenting the audi-ence for computer interfaces, as well as designing generic tools that apply to all users...|$|R

Studies 4 and 5 employed experimental methods that manipulated felt security (trust) to examine how relationship threats differentially affect agreeable versus antagonistic people (those low in agreeableness). Results indicated that not only does felt security consistently mediate the association between agreeableness and important relationship quality variables, but that this is a causal association. That is, these studies provide evidence that agreeable people have better relationships than antagonistic people because they are chronically more trusting, and hence, less prone to seeing signs of rejection where none exists...|$|R

40|$|Endosymbionts, {{which are}} widely {{observed}} in nature, have undergone reductive genome evolution {{because of their}} long-term intracellular lifestyle. Here we compared the complete genome sequences of two different endosymbionts, Buchnera and a protist mitochondrion, with <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relatives to <b>study</b> the evolutionary rates of functional genes in endosymbionts.

This rate increase was observed uniformly among different functional classes of genes, although strong purifying selection may have counterbalanced the rate increase in a few cases. Our data suggest that, contrary to current views, neither the Muller's ratchet effect nor the slightly deleterious mutation theory sufficiently accounts for the elevated evolutionary rate. Rather, the elevated evolutionary rate appears to be mainly due to enhanced mutation rate, although the possibility of relaxation of purifying selection cannot be ruled out...|$|R

Membership in the same clique with peers whose values are highly distinct is thus uncommon.

40|$|Global {{cities have}} been studied {{predominantly}} in terms of speed and movement, acceleration and circulation. This article examines the relationship between globalization and cities in terms that run counter to such emphases, focusing instead on slowness as a condition in contemporary urban life. Drawing on Jamie Peck’s critique of the creativity syndrome in urban policy, we analyze a series of street photography projects {{in the city of}} Amsterdam in order to examine the role of "slow art" in neoliberal urbanization and city profiling. In its capacity to interrupt movement and redirect visual attention, slow art resists both the acceleration of everyday life and the rapid transformation of social space in the global city. Yet, exploited by urban creativity policies, slow art can simultaneously contribute to the gentrification and commodification of cities. We argue that slowness and creativity are deeply implicated in contemporary reshapings of urban social space and that <b>their</b> interrelations merit <b>closer</b> <b>study...</b>|$|R

[...] Another study by Rachel McNair (2002) suggests that slaughterhouse workers may be susceptible to perception-induced traumatic stress, and <b>their</b> situation merits <b>close</b> <b>study.</b> Perpetration-induced traumatic stress (PITS) {{is a form of}} post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which psychological damage arises [...] "from situations that would be traumatic if someone were a victim, but situations for which a person was a causal participant." [...] Essentially, by being involved in creating the traumatic situation, a victim of PITS would suffer PTSD symptoms, including anxiety, panic, depression, increased paranoia, or disassociation. All these symptoms are tied to the psychological consequences of the act of killing.|$|R
40|$|Although {{previous}} {{theories and}} research {{have suggested that}} human behavior is automatically driven by selfish impulses (e. g., vengeance rather than forgiveness), the present research tested the hypothesis that in close relationships, people's impulsive inclination is to be prosocial and to sacrifice for their partner-to pursue {{the interests of the}} partner or of the relationship at some costs for the self. Results from four studies demonstrated that people with low self-control, relative to those with high self-control, reported greater willingness to sacrifice for <b>their</b> <b>close</b> others. Furthermore, <b>Study</b> 4 demonstrated that communal orientation was more strongly associated with sacrifice among participants with low self-control than participants with high self-control. This moderational pattern supports the hypothesis that communal orientation functions as a default approach to sacrifice in the context of close relationships. Taken together, these findings suggest that under certain crucial conditions in close relationships, gut-level impulses are more likely than deliberative considerations to promote prorelationship behavior. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
40|$|During the 12 years 1949 through 1960, funnel {{clouds were}} {{observed}} over {{or near the}} Hawaiian Islands on 31 days. About half of these occurrences mere waterspouts, {{but most of the}} other funnels remained aloft. Although none of the funnel clouds which reached or occurred over land during this period, or previously, appears to have attained the intensity or destructiveness of the major tornadoes of the continental United States, a number of them did minor damage. The climatology and synoptic concomitants of funnel clouds in Hawaii are compared with those of similar events elsewhere, and the associated air mass properties illustrated by several proximity soundings. Among the questions considered is whether the Hawaiian Islands serve merely as a vantage point from which to observe funnel clouds occurring over the nearby open seas, or whether through topography or otherwise they contribute to <b>their</b> formation.

40|$|In recent years, historians {{studying}} the United States {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century have made increasing use of popular writings to identify attitudes and beliefs. One genre of writing which has been largely overlooked by scholars of history is the convent narrative. These texts criticized convents and claimed that American nuns suffered imprisonment and abuse. Numerous examples of this genre, including both avowedly fictional novels and purported real-life autobiographies, were published in the United States between 1850 and 1870. Detailed study of these works uncovers a rich seam of evidence of popular attitudes to a range of political, religious and social forces, including republicanism, Catholicism, immigration, urbanization, industrialization, slavery and the role of women. This study analyzes and compares the themes, ideologies and techniques found in these texts. It will relate these to their wider context, and will examine the role the texts played in transmitting and reinforcing the beliefs and opinions of <b>their</b> authors. <b>Close</b> <b>study</b> of the narratives reveals that their authors were primarily concerned, not with the religious implications of convents and Catholicism (although these did alarm these authors), but, first and foremost, with the safety and stability of the American republic. The creators of convent narratives believed that the republic was under siege from anti-republican forces working to undermine the American way of life on a number of different fronts. These concerns are manifested repeatedly in the convent narratives. Where previously this genre has been overlooked by historians, except as a straightforward manifestation of lurid and sensationalistic anti-Catholic nativism, this study analyzes the deeper ideals and ideologies which these documents reveal, and establishes a basis for further exploration, both of the convent narrative genre in itself and of popular and populist literature in general.

Peer attachment is an attachment relationship that adolescents develop with <b>their</b> <b>closest</b> friends. Research <b>studying</b> peer attachment has divided it into three major categories: trust, communication, and alienation, the later of which is an inverse measure of peer attachment. Youth organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of America (BGCA) offers places outside of school where adolescents can socialize with their peers. This study measured whether the BGCA {{had a significant impact}} on increasing peer attachment, trust, and communication while reducing alienation. Adolescents were tested at a local BGCA using the peer portion of the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. Adolescents were tested again after attending the BGCA for a summer period. One-way t tests were used to calculate the change in IPP A scores. There was no significant change in scores on total peer attachment; t (7) =. 129, ns or on any of the three subscales, communication; t (7) =. 842, ns, alienation; t (7) = 1. 383, ns, and trust; t (7) =. 437, ns.
