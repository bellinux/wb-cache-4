40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{performance}} characteristics of a-Si detectors with Ir- 192 gamma source. Imaging {{performance of the}} detector system is evaluated using contrast sensitivity over a range of material thickness of steel, signal to noise ratio, dynamic range and linearity. The radiographic sensitivity was observed over a range of thickness of steel using standard image quality indicators. Quantum efficiency of the scintillator material (CsI) for Ir- 192 and Co- 60 was studied using theoretical models. For Ir- 192 source both theoretical models and experiments were performed to find the minimum and maximum thickness limitation for steel using the a-Si detector system. Various configurations of pipe weld with defects such as lack of fusion, penetration, <b>tungsten</b> <b>inclusion</b> and porosities were studied to evaluate the imaging performance. 1...|$|E

5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, <b>tungsten</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|R
5000|$|In a [...] "normal" [...] mapping experiment, {{an image}} of the sample is simply the {{intensity}} of a particular emission mapped in an XY raster. For example, an EDS map could be made of a steel sample, in which iron X-ray intensity is used for the intensity grayscale of the image. Dark areas in the image would indicate non-iron-bearing impurities. This could potentially give misleading results; if the steel contained <b>tungsten</b> <b>inclusions,</b> for example, the high atomic number of tungsten could result in bremsstrahlung radiation that would make the iron-free areas appear to be rich in iron.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase [...] "X-ray welding" [...] {{also has}} an older, {{unrelated}} usage in quality control. In this context, an X-Ray welder is a tradesman who consistently welds at such a high proficiency that he rarely introduces defects into the weld pool, {{and is able to}} recognize and correct defects in the weld pool, during the welding process. It is assumed (or trusted) by the Quality Control Department of a fabrication or manufacturing shop that the welding work performed by an X-ray welder would pass an X-ray inspection. For example, defects like porosity, concavities, cracks, cold laps, slag and <b>tungsten</b> <b>inclusions,</b> lack of fusion & penetration, etc., are rarely seen in a radiographic X-ray inspection of a weldment performed by an X-ray welder.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} the dispersion of phononic crystal waveguides formed by evanescent coupling {{of a chain}} of defect cavities and supporting slow-wave propagation. These coupled-resonator acoustic waveguides (CRAWs) are analogous to the coupled-resonator optical waveguides formed in photonic crystals. CRAW dispersion can be controlled by increasing the distance between cavities, with the result of decreasing their coupling, and hence flattening the dispersion relation. Based on the tight-binding model, the dispersion relation {{is found in the}} form of a Fourier series expansion with explicitly given coefficients. This model is tested against the exact dispersion relation of a two-dimensional solid-solid phononic crystal of <b>tungsten</b> <b>inclusions</b> in a silicon matrix and only partial agreement is found. An alternative model of a linear chain of coupled resonators, resting only on the hypotheses of linearity and periodicity, is then proposed. While the Fourier coefficients in this model are a priori unspecified, they can be fitted against the exact dispersion relation, resulting in an excellent agreement with only a few terms in the Fourier series expansion. The Fourier coefficients are shown to be a direct measure of the coupling of neighbouring resonators...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} some concepts for {{non-destructive inspection}} of aeronautic, automotive and energetic components. Eddy current techniques are investigated to detect surface cracks, <b>tungsten</b> carbide <b>inclusions</b> and overheating of aircraft engines components from titanium and nickel alloys. High frequency sensors {{are able to}} visualize local variations of conductivity and magnetic permeability ready for interpretation. In aviation carbon fibre-reinforced plastics increasingly become popular for fuselage applications. Eddy currents can estimate the fibre orientation and gaps between the tapes resulting from manufacturing. In automotive industry eddy current sensor arrays provide visual information about hidden cavities and oxide inclusions in aluminium castings. For the inspection of heat exchanger tubing in the chemical industry imaging eddy current probes are under progress also providing information from {{the back side of}} the tube wall. Future aircrafts should be able for structural health monitoring. One of the favourite techniques is sending Lamb wave along the thin walled fuselage interacting with possible defects. These waves can be generated by integrated or applied piezo-electric transducers directly on the component under inspection. The paper demonstrates some encouraging results obtained by scanning laser vibrometry. ? ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ????????????????????, ????????????? ? ?????????? ??????????. ??? ??????????? ????????????? ??????, ????????? ??????? ????????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????? ? ?????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ????? ????????. ??? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ???? ???????????????, ? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ?????????????. ? ???????????????? ??? ????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????. ???????????? ????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????. ??? ???????? ??????????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ? ???????????????? ???? ? ????????????? ??????????? ????????. ????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????????

40|$|Discontinuities {{and size}} of the weld deposit are {{affected}} by many factors. Magnetic arc blow is one of the factors that one may not be aware of. Magnetic arc blow was studied in this research with the ground position and welding current were varied. The discontinuities {{and size of}} the weld deposit were observed and measured by taking specimens of the carbon steel of AISI 1021 welded by TIG welding process using argon as protective gas. Macro photographs and data {{of the size of the}} weld deposit show magnetic arc blow has strong influence on the size of the weld on the first cut section. This specimen was welded by using 200 Ampere with the ground placed in the starting point of the welding process. Undercut and incomplete penetration are commonly found as discontinuities in all cut sections of the specimens. While porosities occur mainly in the first section with high current. It 2 ̆ 7 s believed that these discontinuities occur due to the lack of shielding by the protective gas caused by very strong arc blow around the melt. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>inclusions</b> are also the common discontinuities to take place, they are found more when welding using high current (200 A). Their occurrence is because of the melting of the tip of the tungsten electrode caused by the high heat input [...] At the end of the weld, crater and spatter are always found. Backward arc blow are very strong at the end of the process that arises these defects. In Bahasa Indonesia : Cacat dan bentuk deposit hasil las busur listrik dipengaruhi oleh banyak faktor. Salah satunya yang sering tidak diketahui adalah adanya pengaruh magnetic arc blow. Magnetic arc blow dengan variasi penempatan ground dan besar arus las dipelajari dalam penelitian ini dengan mengamati pengaruhnya terhadap cacat dan mengukur penampang deposit las yang dihasilkan. Proses las yang diamati adalah las TIG pada baja AISI 1021 dengan gas pelindung argon dengan polaritas lurus (DCSP). Hasil foto makro dan pengukuran menunjukkan magnetic arc blow berpengaruh kuat pada ukuran dan bentuk deposit las pada potongan pertama menggunakan arus 200 A serta penempatan ground pada awal proses pengelasan. Cacat las undercut dan incomplete penetration adalah cacat yang umum dijumpai pada semua potongan. Sedangkan dominasi cacat porositas pada potongan pertama lasan dengan arus 200 A diduga karena kurangnya ruang perlindungan gas dalam daerah las. Inklusi tungsten banyak terjadi pada arus 200 A karena melelehnya ujung elektroda tungsten akibat input panas tinggi. Pada akhir pengelasan selalu dijumpai crater dan percikan. Kedua jenis cacat ini juga diyakini disebabkan oleh backward arc blow yang cukup besar terjadi pada akhir proses lasan.

40|$|Phononic {{crystals}} (PnCs) are man-made structures with periodically varying {{material properties}} such as density, ρ, and elastic modulus, E. Periodic {{variations of the}} material properties with nanoscale characteristic dimensions yield PnCs that operate at frequencies above 10 GHz, allowing for the manipulation of thermal properties. In this article, a 2 D simple cubic lattice PnC operating at 33 GHz is reported. The PnC is created by nanofabrication with a focused ion beam. A freestanding membrane of silicon is ion milled to create a simple cubic array of 32 nm diameter holes that are subsequently backfilled with <b>tungsten</b> to create <b>inclusions</b> at a spacing of 100 nm. Simulations are used to predict the operating frequency of the PnC.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an in-depth analysis of solid locally resonant acoustic metamaterials (LRAMs) consisting of rubber-coated inclusions. Dispersion properties of two-dimensional LRAMs are studied {{by means of}} finite-element modal analysis. For an incompressible rubber, only one practically important spectral band gap is found for in-plane modes in a low-frequency range. This result is in striking contrast with the compressible coating case, previously studied in the literature. For inclusions with a circular cross-section, the lower bound of the band gap can be evaluated exactly {{by means of the}} derived analytical solution, which is also valid for compressible coatings and can therefore be used to determine lower bounds of higher band gaps as well. The influence of geometric and material parameters, filling fraction and inclusion shape on the width of the lowest band gap is investigated in detail. Based on the results of this analysis, an optimal microstructure of LRAMs yielding the widest low-frequency band gap is proposed. To achieve the band gap at the lowest possible frequencies in LRAMs suitable for practical applications, the use of the tungsten core material is advised, as a safe and economically viable alternative to commonly considered lead and gold. Two configurations of LRAM with various sizes of coated <b>tungsten</b> cylindrical <b>inclusions</b> with circular cross-section are considered. The evolution of dispersion spectra due to the presence of different inclusions is investigated, and the parameters for optimal design of LRAMs are determined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
