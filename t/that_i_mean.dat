500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do, for <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|On draft day, Phillips {{made good}} on his promise not to draft Taylor and the Saints instead {{selected}} Heisman Trophy-winning halfback George Rogers with the first pick, leaving the Giants with the decision of whether to select Taylor. To the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected him. Privately, Taylor was hesitant about playing for New York as {{he had hoped to}} be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, and was unimpressed with a tour of Giants Stadium he was taken on, after the draft. Publicly, however, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to play in the city. Taylor changed his stance after he was drafted as Harry Carson made a point to reach out to him, and Taylor said he [...] "talked to some players and coaches" [...] and [...] "got things straightened out." [...] One of the factors that the Giants said they considered in selecting Taylor was his solid reputation. [...] "He was the cleanest player in the draft. By <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> there was no rap on him", said head coach Ray Perkins. [...] "Great potential as a linebacker, a fine young man, free of injuries." [...] Taylor chose to wear number 56 because he was a fan of Cowboys linebacker Thomas Henderson. As it would turn out, Taylor would have the longer and more successful career while Rogers, although successful in his own right with several 1,000-yard rushing seasons and two Pro Bowl selections, was injury-prone and forced to retire following the 1987 season with the Washington Redskins.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tutu has {{described}} himself as a socialist, in 1986 relating that [...] "All my experiences with capitalism, I'm afraid, have indicated that it encourages some of the worst features in people. Eat or be eaten. It is underlined by the survival of the fittest. I can't buy <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> maybe it's the awful face of capitalism, but I haven't seen the other face." [...] Tutu has often used the aphorism that [...] "African communism" [...] is an oxymoron because—in his view—Africans are intrinsically spiritual and this conflicts with the atheistic nature of Marxism. He was critical of the Marxist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, comparing the way that they treated their populations with the way that the National Party treated South Africans.|$|E

[...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found it to be [...] "moody and sometimes ideologically provocative" [...] and added, [...] "Knowing has its grim moments—and by <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> the sort of cringe- (or laugh-) inducing lines of dialogue that have haunted disaster films through the ages ...

[...] Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, Ichabod Spencer, and Orville Dewey, he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that [...] "we ought to obey man's law before the law of God".
