40|$|Background: <b>Tremelimumab,</b> a fully human anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA 4) {{monoclonal}} antibody was {{tested in a}} phase III study to compare the overall survival (OS) with standard, single-agent chemotherapy. Methods: Pts with unresectable stage IIIc-IV melanoma without brain metastasis, LDH below 2 x ULN, and no prior systemic treatment for advanced melanoma were randomized 1 : 1 to either <b>tremelimumab</b> 15 mg/kg IV q 90 d, or physician's choice of TMZ 200 mg/m 2 p. o. d 1 – 5 q 28 d or DTIC 1, 000 mg/m 2 IV q 21 d (chemotherapy arm). Primary endpoint was OS, secondary endpoints included response, durable tumor response, 6 -mo PFS, and safety. 537 deaths would provide 90 % power to detect a 33 % improvement in true median OS with an unstratified log-rank test at overall 2 -sided significance level of 0. 045. Two equally spaced interim analyses were planned based on the group sequential design using the Lan-DeMets alpha and beta spending approach to an O'Brien-Fleming boundary. Results: 655 pts were enrolled between March 2006 and July 2007, 328 pts randomized to <b>tremelimumab</b> (324 treated), 327 to chemotherapy (319 treated). There were no significant imbalances in age, sex, LDH, or stage (5 % stage IIIc, 15 % M 1 a, 22 % M 1 b, 58 % M 1 c). Diarrhea (43 % overall, 14 % grade 3 / 4), pruritus (25 %) and rash (23 %) were the most common treatment-related adverse events in the <b>tremelimumab</b> arm. 3 % of pts had pituitary or adrenal gland toxicities, and 4 % thyroid. There were 3 treatment-related deaths in the <b>tremelimumab</b> arm and none in the chemotherapy arm. Based on a protocol-specified second interim analysis with 340 deaths, the independent DSMC advised to stop the study on 3 / 28 / 08 since the Logrank test-statistic (P-value of 0. 729) had crossed the O'Brien-Fleming futility boundary. Median OS by intent-to-treat was 11. 8 mo (95 % CI 10. 4, 13. 9) in the <b>tremelimumab</b> arm, and 10. 7 mo (95 % CI 9. 3, 12. 0) in the chemotherapy arm, with a HR (chemotherapy over <b>tremelimumab)</b> of 1. 04 (95 % CI 0. 84, 1. 28).

40|$|Purpose: Cytotoxic T {{lymphocyte}} antigen 4 (CTLA 4), a key {{negative regulator}} of T-cell activation, is {{targeted by the}} antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> to release potentially useful antitumor activity. Experimental design: This phase II trial investigated <b>tremelimumab</b> as a second-line treatment for patients with metastatic gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas. <b>Tremelimumab</b> was given every 3 months until symptomatic disease progression. Safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic activity were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen patients received <b>tremelimumab.</b> Most drug-related toxicity was mild; however, there was a single death due to bowel perforation that complicated colitis. Four patients had stable disease with clinical benefit; one patient achieved a partial response after eight cycles (25. 4 months) and remains well on study at 32. 7 months. Markers of regulatory phenotype, forkhead box protein 3 and CTLA 4, doubled transiently in CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) lymphocytes {{in the first month}} after <b>tremelimumab</b> before returning to baseline. In contrast, CTLA 4 increased in CD 4 (+) CD 25 (low/negative) lymphocytes throughout the cycle of treatment. De novo proliferative responses to tumor-associated antigens 5 T 4 (8 of 18 patients) and carcinoembryonic antigen (5 of 13) were detected. Patients with a posttreatment carcinoembryonic antigen proliferative response had median survival of 17. 1 months compared with 4. 7 months for nonresponders (P = 0. 004). Baseline interleukin- 2 release after T-cell activation was higher in patients with clinical benefit and toxicity. CONCLUSION: Despite the disappointing response rate of <b>tremelimumab,</b> one patient had a remarkably durable benefit for this poor-prognosis disease. In vitro evidence of enhanced proliferative responses to relevant tumor-associated antigens suggests that combining CTLA 4 blockade with antigen-targeted therapy may warrant further investigation...|$|E

30|$|In {{an early}} phase I trial {{investigating}} {{the combination of}} first-line <b>tremelimumab</b> and gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer, the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of gemcitabine was similar in the absence or presence of <b>tremelimumab</b> at the highest dose level of 15  mg/kg [48]. The MTD was full-dose gemcitabine 1000  mg/m 2 (weekly for 3  weeks with 1  week off) and <b>tremelimumab</b> 15  mg/kg on day 1 every 84 -day cycles. The most common grade 3 – 4 treatment-related AE at the MTD was neutropenia (18 %) and toxicity associated with combination therapy was essentially {{similar to that of}} <b>tremelimumab</b> monotherapy. Several phase I-II trials have since demonstrated the feasibility of adding standard-dose checkpoint inhibitors to full-dose gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel in the first- and second-line treatment settings in advanced pancreatic cancer (Table  2) [49 – 52, 54]. Immune-related AEs have ranged from 5.9 % to 47.1 % (all grades) with combination chemotherapy and anti-PD- 1 or anti-CTLA- 4 therapy [48, 50]. Premedication with intravenous dexamethasone 12  mg on the day of chemotherapy infusion was shown to decrease grade 3 – 4 AEs (2.2 events/patient) compared to those without premedication (1.1 events/patient) [50].|$|E

Addition of the fully human anti-CTLA- 4 (<b>tremelimumab)</b> to cultures of human T cells with allogenic dendritic cells (DCs) did not increase proliferation. Magnetic bead-mediated elimination of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) regulatory T cells (T(reg)) before setting up those alloreactive cultures also largely failed to increase primary proliferation. In contrast, predepletion of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T(reg) and culture {{in the presence of}} <b>tremelimumab</b> synergistically resulted in increased proliferation and DC:T-cell aggregation. These effects were much more prominent in CD 4 than in CD 8 T cells. The synergy mechanism can be traced to enhanced CTLA- 4 expression in effector cells as a result of T(reg) elimination, thereby offering more targets to the blocking antibody. Human T cells and allogenic DCs (derived both from healthy donors and advanced cancer patients) were coinjected in the peritoneum of Rag 2 (-/-) IL- 2 Rγ(-/-) mice. In these conditions, <b>tremelimumab</b> injected intravenously did not significantly enhance alloreactive proliferation unless T(reg) cells had been predepleted. Synergistic effects in vivo were again largely restricted to the CD 4 T-cell compartment. In addition, T(reg) depletion and CTLA- 4 blockade synergistically enhanced specific cytotoxicity raised in culture against autologous EBV-transformed cell lines. Taken together, these experiments indicate that <b>tremelimumab</b> therapy may benefit from previous or concomitant T(reg) depletion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Th 17 {{cells are}} CD 4 + cells that produce {{interleukin}} 17 (IL- 17) and are potent inducers of tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. We studied {{the levels of}} this T cell subset in peripheral blood of patients treated with the anti-CTLA 4 antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> since its major dose limiting toxicities are inflammatory and autoimmune in nature. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected before and after receiving <b>tremelimumab</b> within two clinical trials, one with <b>tremelimumab</b> alone (21 patients) and another together with autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with the melanoma epitope MART- 1 26 – 35 (6 patients). Cytokines were quantified directly in plasma from patients and after in vitro stimulation of PBMC. We also quantified IL- 17 cytokine-producing cells by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Results There were no significant changes in 13 assayed cytokines, including IL- 17, when analyzing plasma samples obtained from patients before and after administration of <b>tremelimumab.</b> However, when PBMC were activated in vitro, IL- 17 cytokine in cell culture supernatant and Th 17 cells, detected as IL- 17 -producing CD 4 cells by ICS, significantly increased in post-dosing samples. There were no differences in the levels of Th 17 cells between patients with or without an objective tumor response, but samples from patients with inflammatory and autoimmune toxicities during the first cycle of therapy had {{a significant increase in}} Th 17 cells. Conclusion The anti-CTLA 4 blocking antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> increases Th 17 cells in peripheral blood of patients with metastatic melanoma.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of parvovirus H- 1 (H- 1 PV) to efficiently kill colorectal cancer cells and induce immunogenicity of colorectal tumors by inducing maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) alone and also in combination with cytostatic drugs in vitro. Using our cell culture model, we have additionally investigated the effects of anti-CTLA- 4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) receptor antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> on this process. Materials and methods: Colon carcinoma cell lines were treated with different concentrations of cytostatic drugs or <b>tremelimumab</b> or were infected with H- 1 PV in different multiplicities of infection (MOIs), and viability was determined using MTT assays. Expression of CTLA- 4 in colon carcinoma cell lines was measured by FACScan™. For the coculture model, we isolated monocytes using adherence, and differentiation into immature DCs (iDCs) was stimulated using interleukin- 4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Maturation of iDCs into mature DCs (mDCs) was induced by a cytokine cocktail. SW 480 colon carcinoma cells were infected with H- 1 PV or treated with cytostatic drugs. Drug treated and H- 1 PV-infected SW 480 colon carcinoma cells were cocultured with iDCs and expression of maturation markers was measured using FACScan™. Cytokine measurements were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Colon carcinoma cells SW 480 were potently infected and killed by H- 1 PV. CTLA- 4 expression in SW 480 cells increased after infection with H- 1 PV and also after treatment with cytostatic drugs. <b>Tremelimumab</b> had no influence on viability of the colon carcinoma cell line. There was no maturation of iDCs after coculture with SW 480; instead, H- 1 PV-infected or drug pretreated SW 480 induced maturation.

Treatment with these mAbs has demonstrated clinically important and durable tumor responses and disease control rates {{in patients with}} unresectable advanced melanoma. Durable objective responses have been reported across a spectrum of doses and schedules, with relative safety in this patient population. Although the phase III <b>tremelimumab</b> melanoma study was closed for “futility”, the 1 -year survival rate of > 50 % for <b>tremelimumab</b> and the median survival of 11. 7 months (compared with 10. 7 months for chemotherapy) are notable. Results of the phase III studies testing CTLA 4 -blockade with ipilimumab are eagerly anticipated. The further development of these agents includes testing in the neoadjuvant melanoma setting (ipilimumab) as well the adjuvant high-risk melanoma setting (ipilimumab). Future progress with CTLA- 4 blockade therapy will also likely come {{from the use of}} combinations of agents that target several critical regulatory pathways of the immune system and modulate the immune response in the host in a synergistic and controlled fashion...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{effects on}} cell {{signalling}} networks upon blockade of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen- 4 (CTLA 4) using the monoclonal antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with metastatic melanoma. Methodology/Principal: Findings Intracellular flow cytometry {{was used to}} detect phosphorylated (p) signaling molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) and cytokine receptors. PBMC from tremelimumab-treated patients were characterized by increase in pp 38, pSTAT 1 and pSTAT 3, and decrease in pLck, pERK 1 / 2 and pSTAT 5 levels. These changes were noted in CD 4 and CD 8 T lymphocytes but also in CD 14 monocytes. A divergent pattern of phosphorylation of Zap 70, LAT, Akt and STAT 6 was noted in patients with or without an objective tumor response. Conclusions/Significance: The administration of the CTLA 4 -blocking antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> to patients with metastatic melanoma influences signaling networks downstream of the TCR and cytokine receptors both in T cells and monocytes. The strong modulation of signaling networks in monocytes suggests that this cell subset {{may be involved in}} clinical response...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnti-programmed {{cell death}}- 1 and anti-programmed cell death ligand- 1 (PD-L 1) monotherapies have shown {{promising}} clinical activity in advanced, refractory non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but antitumor activity {{appears to be}} greater in patients with PD-L 1 + tumors compared with patients harboring PD-L 1 − tumors. Combining the anti-PD-L 1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody <b>tremelimumab</b> offers the potential for antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L 1 tumor status. ARCTIC (NCT 02352948) is a global, phase III, randomized, open-label multicenter study in patients with advanced NSCLC assessing the safety and clinical activity of durvalumab versus standard of care (SoC; erlotinib, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) in patients with PD-L 1 + tumors (≥ 25 % of tumor cells with membrane staining using VENTANA PD-L 1 [SP 263] CDx Assay) (Sub-study A) and the combination of durvalumab + <b>tremelimumab</b> or either agent as monotherapy versus SoC in patients with PD-L 1 − tumors (Sub-study B). Eligible patients are those with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB/IV), without epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements, who have received at least 2 prior systemic regimens, including 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Co-primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients alive at 12 months, objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival at 6 and 12 months, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and quality of life. The exploratory endpoints will assess potential biomarkers of treatment response. Recruitment started in January 2015 and is ongoing...|$|E

The understanding of the immune responses and their regulation at the intracellular level {{and the development of}} fully humanized monoclonal antibodies are the pillars of an approach that could elicit durable clinical responses and even remission in some patients with cancer. Most of the immune checkpoints that regulate the T-cell responses (activation and inhibition) operate through proteins present on the cytoplasmic membrane of the immune cells. Therefore, specific antibodies capable of blocking the inhibitory signals should lead to unrestrained immune responses that supersede the inhibitory mechanisms, which are naturally present in the tumor microenviroment. The best-known and most successful targets for immune checkpoint therapy are the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen- 4 and programmed cell death- 1 coreceptors. <b>Tremelimumab</b> (CP- 675, 206) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody specific for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen- 4, which has been successfully used to treat patients with metastatic melanoma and some other cancers. Although still a work in progress, the use of <b>tremelimumab</b> as an immune checkpoint therapeutic agent is a promising approach alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs. Here, we review the use of this antibody in a number of clinical trials against solid tumors. Keywords: immune checkpoint, anti-CTLA- 4 blockade antibody, cance...|$|E
