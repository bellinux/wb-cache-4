[...] This is an album <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of feeling behind it, and it's very naked…That might in fact be , but the reason it is that way is because it was done stream-of-consciously. [...] I'm not calculated. [...] I don't mind sentimentality, as long as it's not calculated." ...|$|E
500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do with it."

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

[...] AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Slash's contributions [...] "quite amazing", though criticised the song-writing, stating [...] "it's {{too bad that}} nobody in the band bothered to write any songs." [...] Devon Jackson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as [...] "relaxed headbanging and Southern-tinged blues-rock" [...] while Classic Rock reviewer Malcolm Dome stated [...] "musically, it's a loose-limbed record <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of heavy guitar-led punk-style pop-rock." [...] Slash's Snakepit toured {{in support of the}} album, with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy, of Pride and Glory, replacing Inez and Sorum, who had opted out of touring, with Sorum returning to Guns N' Roses. They toured the US, Europe, Japan and Australia with Slash stating that [...] "for the first time in years, touring was easy, [...] band mates were loads of fun and low on drama, and every gig was about playing rock and roll." [...] While booking another leg of the tour, Slash was informed by Geffen that Rose was ready to begin work on the new Guns N' Roses album and that he was to return to Los Angeles. Geffen pulled financial support for the band's tour with Slash's Snakepit disbanding soon after.|$|E

[...] Lerner warns, [...] "when this bubble of repression of dialogue explodes into open resentment at the way Jewish Political correctness has been imposed, it may really yield a 'new' anti-Semitism. To prevent that, the voices of dissent on Israeli policy must be given the same national exposure in the media and American politics that the voices of the Jewish establishment have been given." ...|$|E
