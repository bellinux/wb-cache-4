Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory bombing run on a Japanese hospital ship known {{to be in their}} area.|$|E

25|$|On her sixth voyage, {{the most}} {{important}} stop of Suomen Joutsen was New York City, where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, Senegal {{and a number of}} ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the United States under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the Hudson River, an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and Suomen Joutsen remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the 35th Street. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at Oslo, Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on the May Day of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living crocodile under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.|$|E

500|$|The album title {{led to a}} {{legal case}} that {{attracted}} considerable attention: a Virgin Records store in Nottingham that put the album in its window was threatened with prosecution for displaying [...] "indecent printed matter". The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that bollocks was an Old English term for a small ball, that it appeared [...] "in place names without stirring any sensual desires in the local communities", {{and that in the}} nineteenth century it had been used as a nickname for clergymen: [...] "Clergymen are known <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense." [...] In the context of the Pistols' album title, the term does in fact primarily signify [...] "nonsense". Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. An exasperated Jones said, [...] "Oh, fuck it, never mind the bollocks of it all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>A</b> into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see {{whether you like it or}} not, and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E
