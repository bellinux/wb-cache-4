25|$|A {{number of}} {{native-born}} artists {{at the time}} followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called costumbristas, a word deriving from costumbre (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was Agustín Arrieta from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics.</b> His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of {{painting}} was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was Bavarian artist Johann Moritz Rugendas, who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman Daniel Egerton, who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German Carl Nebel, who primarily created lithographs of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called costumbristas, a word deriving from costumbre (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well.

40|$|Abstract. The term frit {{refers to}} a fused {{material}} produced from silica and flux, which is served as, intermediates {{in the manufacture of}} glaze, glass and faience. The frit is crushed and used for making glazes and stonepaste, which is also known as fritware. In this research frits and vitreous materials from a kiln excavation site in Iznik have been studied through the SEM-EDS and SEM microprobe analysis. This study has been based on the examination of the composition and microstructure of the samples to elucidate the production technology in terms of the materials used and the firing procedures. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the technology of frit making in Iznik and to find the relation between the composition of frits to those of the glazes of Iznik <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics.</b> Some of the analysed samples are found to be alkaline lead frits containing tin that is very consistent with the glazes of Iznik <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics.</b> The others are soda lime frits which were most probably used in the stonepaste body...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{archaeologists have}} {{increasingly}} depended on archaeometric rather than strictly stylistic data to explore questions of ceramic provenance and technol- ogy, and, by extension, trade, exchange, social networks and even identity. It is accepted as obvious by some archaeometrists and statisti- cians {{that the results}} of the analyses of compo- sitional data may be dependent on the format of the data used, on the data exploration method employed and, in the case of multivari- ate analyses, even on the number of elements considered. However, this is rarely articulated clearly in publications, making it less obvious to archaeologists. In this short paper, we re- examine compositional data from a collection of bricks, <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics</b> from Hill Hall, near Epping in Essex, England, as a case study to show how the method of data exploration used and the number of elements considered in multivariate analyses of compositional data can affect the sorting of ceramic samples into chemical groups.

40|$|Remnants of the {{fortified}} settlement Veletin {{are located}} on a hill {{of the same name}} (map marking 969) near the small town Janjevo, {{in the vicinity of the}} Monastery Gračanica in Kosovo, in a region rich in metal ore (pic. 1 - 3). Veletin is mentioned for the first time as a landmark in King Milutin’s charter for the Monastery Gračanica issued in 1321. Namely, the boundary of villages donated to the monastery ran "from Oštri vrh on Veletjen between Sušica and between Gušterica". Villages of Sušica and Gušterica still exist under the same names. The mentioned Veletin refers to the hill with a fortified settlement or fortress at the top. In the past the hill and the fortress were for a long time a characteristic part of the historical landscape. Thanks to its favourable geostrategic position, vicinity of important roads and above all to the nearness of rich silver mines, the hill of Veletin was settled and fortified in pre-historic time, then in antiquity and in the middle ages. It is supposed that the Roman town Ulpiana (Justiniana Secunda), near the Monastery Gračanica, developed because of the vicinity of silver mines and that as a municipium became a center of administration of Janjevo - Novo Brdo metals in the II c. Mining reached its peak in this area only in the first half of the XV c., during the reign of Serbian despots. When this part of Serbia fell under Turkish rule in 1455, mining began to decline. In 1488, during the reign of Sultan Bajazet II, special regulations were made for the organization of work in Janjevo silver mines, which testify about their importance. It is hard to form an opinion about the appearance of Veletin at the time the Gračanica Charter was issued. Mining was growing at that time and it is possible that there was a fortress with a small crew to protect Janjevo and other nearby mining settlements. Veletin is explicitly mentioned as a fortress only in three cartographic sources of a later date. The first was the Atlas by V. M. Coronelli, published in 1689 in Venice (pic. 4). In the part of the map in the center of which is Kosovo Field (Campo Cassovo), Veletin is marked near Janjevo (Iagneuo) as a ruin: "Valetino rouin. " (ato), as evidence of its earlier importance. The second mention of Veletin is made in the Map of the central course of the Danube etc., by Johann Baptist Homan, prepared in Nuremberg between 1707 and 1724. Veletin appears for the third time in the New map of Dalmatia, Croatia etc., published by Mathias Seuter in Augsburg before 1758. From the time Veletin was destroyed it was never renovated as far as we know and time took its toll. The walls of the fortress and other buildings were used by local inhabitants as a source of building materials until they completely disappeared, what apparently happened in the 70 ’s of the XX c. Remains of the walls whose shape can be discerned under the soil show that the foundation of the fortress was adjusted to the configuration of the ground. That is to say, the hill of Veletin ends in sheer rock on northern and north-eastern sides and is completely inaccessible (pic. 5) while on other sides there are moderately steep terraced slopes (pic. 6 - 9) on which rampart walls were built following topographic relief (plans 10 and 11). Two plans of the fortress Veletin were published until now (pic. 10 11). The third plan, the most accurate, was not published. It shows that the for­tress had the form of an irregular polygon, and that it was defended by three perimeters of walls forming the Upper, the Middle, and the Lower town (pic. 12). In the south-eastern part of the Lower town are remnants of a rectangular and of a round building. Archeological probes on Veletin were performed by Edi Shukriu in 1987 and 1988. Archeological material shows that the oldest settlement was formed in Neolithic period, belonging to the Bubanj-Hum culture. The younger settlement is from the Iron Age and is connected to the Suva Reka group. Finds of fragments of Attica ceramics of black-figure style points to connections with Greece in the VI c. (pic. 13 / 1, 2), while curved fibula with charniere shows that the inhabitants of Veletin in V-IV c. possessed jewelry of high quality and aesthetically embellished (pic. 13 / 3, 4). There are yet no material remains from the Hellenistic period. Rampart walls were built in the late classical period and numerous finds of <b>tiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics</b> could be dated to the same period (pic. 13 / 5 - 7). Also were found fragments of medieval ceramic vessels (pic. 13 / 8), two iron arrows (pic. 13 / 9, 10), and an earring of bjelobrdo type dating from X-XII c. (pic. 13 / 11 and pic. 14). Destruction of remains of Veletin is continuing to this day. In more recent times part of the eastern rampart (?) wall (pic. 15) was damaged, while in the vicinity part of a threshold of the town gate or of some other larger building was discovered (pic. 16) ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The study {{aimed at}} {{measuring}} exhaled breath malondialdehyde (EBC-MDA) in workers exposed to dust containing silica {{and at its}} comparison with the non-exposed control group. Material and methods The cross sectional, case-control study (N = 50) was performed in a <b>tile</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceramics</b> production factory in Yazd, Iran. EBC-MDA was quantified in exhaled breath of the participants by a lab made breath sampler. Exposure intensity was measured according to the NIOSH 0600 method in selected homogeneous exposure groups. Additionally, spirometry test was conducted to investigate a correlation between EBC-MDA and spirometric findings in the exposed workers. Results There {{was no difference in}} the observed exposure intensities of silica containing dust in different units. However, “coating preparation” was the unit with the highest concentration of dust. Although, the level of EBC-MDA in the cases was slightly higher than in the controls, the difference was not statistically significant (U = 252, p = 0. 464). A significant and positive correlation was found between dust exposure intensity in working units and the measured EBC-MDA of workers (r = 0. 467, N = 25, p = 0. 027). There were also no statistically significant differences among job categories in the exposed group for the values of FEV 1 % (F(3, 44) = 0. 656, p = 0. 584), FVC% (F(3, 44) = 1. 417, p = 0. 172), and FEV 1 /FVC% (F(3, 44) = 1. 929, p = 0. 139). Conclusions The results showed a significant correlation between respirable dust exposure intensity and the level of EBC-MDA of the exposed subjects.
