5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail <b>trash</b> removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of <b>trash</b> from 3,500 <b>trash</b> receptacles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trashing</b> has the {{potential}} to improve yield by conserving water, soil C and soil N in sugarcane production. However, the benefits of <b>trashing</b> are complex to determine because of variability in rainfall (between regions and seasons) and the long-term effect of cropping soil systems on N dynamics. In a companion paper a cropping systems model, which accounts for the impacts of water and N stress on sugarcane growth, was shown to predict the long-term response of cane yield and soil organic matter changes under a range of <b>trashing</b> treatments. This paper expands the modelling analysis by examining the benefits of <b>trashing</b> over a wider range of soils and climatic conditions. Possible changes to cane production management practices in the South African sugar industry following the adoption of <b>trashing</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{irrigation}} levels from 37 % to 84 % of Class "A " Pan evaporation {{produced a}} linear increase in cane yield from 65 to 146 tonslha. The response with burnt cane was greater due to more severe moisture stress, {{and there was}} also an increase in cane yield between 84 % and 100 % Pan which was absent in <b>trashed</b> cane. Maximum sucrose content, as well as brix, purity and recoverable sugar % cane were obtained with a level of 68 % Pan; both higher and lower irrigation levels were significantly poorer in cane quality. Burnt cane produced higher sucrose content than <b>trashed</b> cane except at 37 % Pan. Maximum yields of sucrose per hectare were obtained at 84 % Pan with <b>trashing</b> and 100 % Pan with burning. At 37 % Pan, <b>trashing</b> produced 4 tons sucrose/ha more than burning; this difference declined with increasing irrigation IeveIs up to 80 % Pan when {{there was no difference between}} burning and <b>trashing.</b> At 100 % Pan, burning yielded 2 tons sucrose/ha more than <b>trashing.</b> Maximum efficiency of water use (expressed as kg sucrose/m 3 water) was obtained generally at 68 % Pan, with drier levels of irrigation giving far poorer efficiencies, especially with burnt cane. Increasing irrigation levels also increased stalk numbers, stalk height, lodging and flower counts. Burning produced more stalks than <b>trashing</b> at all levels of irrigation except 37 % Pan; it also resulted in less lodging than did <b>trashing...</b>|$|R

5|$|In May 2013, Alamogordo's City Commission {{approved}} {{a deal for}} Canada-based film production company Fuel Industries to excavate the Atari landfill site.

On April 26, 2014, video game archaeologists began sifting through years of <b>trash</b> from the old Alamogordo landfill. The first batch of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds of <b>trash</b> and dirt scooped by a backhoe. In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 percent of what was found.|$|E
