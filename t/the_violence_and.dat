5|$|Meanwhile, two {{separate}} embassies had been dispatched to Tyre {{to appeal to}} Ummidius Caius Quadratus, who as legate of Syria had some authority over the lower-ranking procurator of Iudaea. One, from the Samaritans, protested the Jewish attacks on Samaritan villages. The Jewish counter-embassy held the Samaritans responsible for <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> accused Cumanus of siding with them. Agreeing to investigate, Quadratus proceeded in 52 to Iudaea, where he had all of Cumanus' Jewish prisoners crucified and ordered the beheading of several other Jews and Samaritans who {{had been involved in}} the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago race riot of 1919 {{was a major}} racial {{conflict}} that began in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3.

It is considered {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, so named because of <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, looting, and murder made it the worst race riot in the history of Illinois.|$|E

5|$|At {{its sixth}} annual {{convention}} in Vavuniya on 25 May 1958 ITAK resolved {{to launch a}} non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve its goals. In May and June 1958 Ceylon witnessed anti-Tamil rioting. Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when the detention order was lifted.|$|E
5|$|Britain had {{remained}} neutral throughout the first {{stages of the}} war. Although unsympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling {{to go to war}} alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself was very strong, having been expanded and improved during the 1780s – indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy {{had been one of the}} causes of the original Revolution in 1789.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E

5|$|Sophiatown , {{also known}} as Sof'town or Kofifi, is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Sophiatown was a legendary black {{cultural}} hub that was destroyed under apartheid, rebuilt {{under the name of}} Triomf, and in 2006 officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of the excesses of South Africa under apartheid. Despite <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> poverty, it was the epicentre of politics, jazz and blues during the 1940s and 1950s. It produced some of South Africa's most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|Ventidius Cumanus (fl. 1st century AD) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c. AD 52. A {{disagreement}} between the surviving sources, the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman Tacitus, makes it unclear whether his authority was over {{some or all}} of the province. Cumanus' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population. Ventidius Cumanus failed to respond to an anti-Jewish murder in Samaritan territory which led to the violent conflict between Jews and Samaritans. Following an investigation by the governor of Syria, Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, Cumanus was sent to Rome for a hearing before the Emperor Claudius, who held him responsible for <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> sentenced him to exile.|$|E

5|$|He scored nine {{goals in}} 36 {{games in the}} 1904–05 season, as City came within two points and two places of champions Newcastle United. The season ended in {{controversial}} circumstances at Villa Park, and with a 3–2 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows. The Football Association launched an investigation into <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for {{the entirety of the}} 1905–06 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City £900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board was concerned about <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot {{the ending of the}} film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> {{terror of}} Pontiac's War {{convinced}} many western Pennsylvanians that their {{government was not}} doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that {{came to be known as}} the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{growth of}} <b>violence</b> in schools {{is a serious}} social problem that deserves more {{in-depth}} reflections they can explain their reason for being. To accomplish this, it becomes necessary conceptual clarification, as the explanation of <b>the</b> concept of <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distinction between school <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> in schools, {{as well as a}} theoretical basis that can explain <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>violence,</b> such as <b>the</b> theory of schemes accumulation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship between <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> society. These elements allow a historical analysis of capitalist development that spells out the close relationship between <b>the</b> levels of <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dynamics of accumulation schemes. From this understanding of <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>violence</b> in schools <b>and</b> its expanded enlargement becomes possible. The conclusion is that the enlargement of <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> in schools is closely related to the transition to the full regime of accumulation and, more recently, with its destabilization process...|$|R
