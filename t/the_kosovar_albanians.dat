50|$|The 1918-1929 period {{under the}} Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes {{was a time}} of {{persecution}} of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians.</b> Kosovo was split into four counties—three being a part of official Serbia: Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one in Montenegro: northern Metohija.

In effect, it was a compromise between the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which was stipulated by UNSCR 1244 and rejected by <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians,</b> transforming the KLA into KPC.|$|E
50|$|Tetovo under Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia {{went through}} major changes. Many Communist styled apartments were {{built around the}} city centre of Tetovo as well as {{concrete}} roads. New suburbs such as the Hajdućka suburb were formed to help accommodate the rising number of Macedonians moving to the city. Some of the city's historic buildings, such as the Old Mosque, were demolished by the authorities. When troubles in neighbouring Kosovo began in 1981, Tetovo {{had to be put}} under control of paramilitary police due to the rioting and show of sympathy with <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians.</b> The same happened again in 1989.|$|E
50|$|The KLA {{made their}} name known {{publicly}} {{for the first}} time in 1995, and a first public appearance followed in 1997, at which time its membership was still only around 200. Critical of the progress made by Rugova, the KLA received boosts from the 1995 Dayton Accords— these granted Kosovo nothing, and so generated a more widespread rejection of the LDK's peaceful methods — and from looted weaponry that spilled into Kosovo after the Albanian rebellion of 1997. During 1997-98, the Kosovo Liberation Army moved ahead of Rugova's LDK, a fact starkly illustrated by the KLA's Hashim Thaçi leading <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> at the Rambouillet negotiations of spring 1999, with Rugova as his deputy.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanian</b> {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a red star, since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation.

Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Verso Books {{published}} Parenti's To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia. According to Kirkus Reviews: [...] "Parenti dissents {{from every}} piece of conventional wisdom about the former Yugoslavia’s breakup, the Kosovo crisis, and the NATO bombing campaign against the Serbian state in purported support of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians.</b> Instead, he assembles an alternate history in which an American-led coalition backed by aggressive financial interests precipitated {{the civil war and}} the profoundly destructive air campaign that killed at least 3,000 civilians." [...] Publishers Weekly's review stated: [...] "Parenti gives an unabashedly critical assessment of this intervention, based on a solid and passionate rejection of Western leaders' 'lies' about events in the Balkans and Western interests {{in that part of the}} world. Readers not familiar with his leftist analysis may find Parenti's dismissal of NATO's justification for its 1999 bombing campaign shocking or silly; others may find it thought-provoking." ...|$|E
50|$|Prizren was the {{cultural}} and intellectual centre of Ottoman Kosovo. It was dominated by its Muslim population, who composed over 70% of its population in 1857. The city became the biggest Albanian cultural centre and the coordination political and cultural capital of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians.</b> In 1871, a long Serbian seminary was opened in Prizren, discussing the possible joining of the old Serbia's territories with the Principality of Serbia.It was {{an important part of}} Kosovo Vilayet between 1877 and 1912.During the late 19th century the city became a focal point for Albanian nationalism and saw the creation in 1878 of the League of Prizren, a movement formed to seek the national unification and liberation of Albanians within the Ottoman Empire. The Young Turk Revolution was a step in the dissolving of the Ottoman empire that led to the Balkan Wars. The Third Army (Ottoman Empire) had a division in Prizren, the 30th Reserve Infantry Division (Otuzuncu Pirzerin Redif Fırkası).|$|E
5000|$|Because of its ideology, {{which was}} deemed {{nationalist}} and separatist, it was {{banned by the}} Yugoslavian authorities, together with the self-styled shadow Kosovo Parliament that opposed the ratifications of Kosovo's real assembly in July 1990. As a result, its members proclaimed in protest {{on the steps of}} the parliament building the [...] "Republic of Kosova", independent from Yugoslavia, which drafted its own constitution. Claiming that conditions for Albanians were not addressed, the LDK successfully called for a boycott of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> of the first free elections in 1990. Following the 1991 population census, in which LDK President Rugova also called for boycott, resulting in only 9,091 Albanians recorded which composed around 2.53% of the Kosovar population, the LDK called the Albanian people to leave and boycott all state institutions until the solution of the Albanian national question. The LDK opposed the centralized control imposed by Belgrade, which reintroduced the Serbian language as the language of Kosovo as well as making other implementations; and they were growing deeply concerned about Belgrade's handling of the Albanian populace with regards to the wider group interests.|$|E

As the largest group, they tend to be the most visible, besides the factor of opposition against Islam in Switzerland, and the problem of immigrant criminality. In a 2010 statistic, young males of the former Serbia and Montenegro (which to a large extent corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> in Switzerland) were found to have a crime rate of 310% of the young males in Swiss population, while those from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia had crime rates of 230% - 240% of the Swiss value. It has been pointed out that the crime rates cannot be the only reason for the group's poor image, as the crime rate of the Sri Lankans in Switzerland was still higher, at 470%, while that group has a much better reputation.|$|E
5000|$|Support for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the {{legitimacy}} of NATO's bombing campaign came {{from a variety of}} sources. In a 2009 article, David Clark claimed [...] "Every member of NATO, every EU country, and most of Yugoslavia's neighbours, supported military action." [...] Statements from the leaders of United States, Czech Republic and United Kingdom, respectively, described the war as one [...] "upholding our values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of peace", [...] "the first war for values" [...] and one [...] "to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo." [...] Others included the then U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace though Annan stressed that the [...] "Security Council should have been involved in any decision to use force." [...] The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports. One was conducted by the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, entitled The Kosovo Report, which found that: Yugoslav forces were engaged in a well-planned campaign of terror and expulsion of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians.</b> This campaign is most frequently described as one of [...] "ethnic cleansing," [...] intended to drive many, if not all, Kosovar Albanians from Kosovo, destroy the foundations of their society, and prevent them from returning. It concluded that [...] "the NATO military intervention was illegal but legitimate", The second report was published by the NATO Office of Information and Press which reported that, [...] "the human rights violations committed on a large scale in Kosovo provide an incontestable ground with reference to the humanitarian aspect of NATO's intervention." [...] Some critics note that NATO did not have the backing of the United Nations Security Council meant that its intervention had no legal basis, but according to some legal scholars, [...] "there are nonetheless certain bases for that action that are not legal, but justified." ...|$|E

During the course of his war of ethnic aggression, Milosevic was predictably aided in his efforts by radical Serbian intellectuals, nationalist paramilitary organizations, the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), Croatian Serb and Bosnian Serb protégées such as Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, and a generally passive Serbian population...|$|E

5000|$|In post {{conflict}} Kosovo Rugova {{as first}} president in his drive toward emphasizing aspects of statehood spent time researching and pursued an identity management project that centred on ancient Dardania and designed state symbols {{for a future}} independent Kosovo. Notable among those are the Kosovan presidential flag that displays the two headed eagle of Skanderbeg with the word Dardania emblazoned on it. Some <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> have referred to Kosovo as Dardania and Rugova at times supported those moves. [...] To define Kosovo as an Albanian area, a toponyms commission (1999) led by <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanian</b> academics was established to determine new or alternative names for some settlements, streets, squares and organisations with Slavic origins that underwent a process of Albanisation during this period. Those measures have been promoted by sectors of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanian</b> academic, political, literary and media elite that caused administrative and societal confusion with multiple toponyms being used resulting in sporadic acceptance by wider <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanian</b> society.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{show how}} {{identity}} can be of importance to issues relating to development. More specifically, it deals with how <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> perception of their collective identity have affected Kosovo’s economic development. The study draws primarily from the theories of Identity Economics and Orientalism and presents a hypothesis which is then tested empirically through {{the analysis of the}} in-depth interviews and participant observation carried out in Kosovo. The results show that Kosovar Albanians have, to a degree, internalized the Orientalist discourse, which often portrayed them in racist terms as the ’other’, in their view of their collective identity and that this has had a negative effect on how they perceive their potential in the global economic system, which in turn has undermined the country’s economic development. Thus, identity seems to be of significance when it comes to issues relating to development...|$|E
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} from the US context that women, although hardly pacifist, are less supportive {{of the use of}} military force than are men. However, the evidence is largely restricted to one conflict episode (the first Gulf War), and there is almost no cross-national evidence that would allow us to evaluate important hypotheses (especially concerning the universality of gender differences). In this paper, I aim to close this gap in the evidence. The Data Collection The dataset includes survey measures of support for using military force in six historical episodes: the Gulf War of 1991; the ensuing confrontation with Iraq over weapons inspections (1991 - 2002); NATO’s intervention in Bosnia (1992 - 1995); NATO’s attack against Serbia in support of <b>the</b> <b>Kosovar</b> <b>Albanians</b> (1998 - 1999); the US war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan (2001 - 2004); and the war against Iraq and subsequent occupation (2003 -).
