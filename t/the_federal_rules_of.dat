5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil Procedure.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E

25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Appellate Procedure and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E

25|$|Examples {{of common}} law being {{replaced}} by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most {{but not all of}} the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (<b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil Procedure in the 1930s and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Evidence in the 1970s).

25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements.

25|$|Despite Schiff's age (he turned 78 {{years old}} {{on the day}} of sentencing), on February 24, 2006, Schiff was sentenced to 151 months (12 years and 7 months) in prison and was ordered to pay over $4.2 million in {{restitution}} to the Internal Revenue Service; Schiff was also sentenced to 12 additional months for contempt of court. On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed Schiff's convictions except for the criminal contempt convictions. The Court vacated the contempt convictions because of the failure of the trial court judge to file contempt orders under rule 42(b) of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure.|$|E
25|$|The plaintiffs {{successfully}} {{argued that}} after Congress adopted <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Evidence in 1975, Frye {{was no longer}} the governing standard for admitting scientific evidence in trials held in federal court. The Supreme Court agreed and had already ruled that where common law rules conflicted with provisions of the Rules, the enactment of the Rules had the effect of supplanting the common law. Frye was certainly part of the federal common law of evidence because it was decided almost 50 years before the Rules were enacted. But the text of the Rules did not suggest that Congress intended to keep the Frye rule, and so the Court reasoned that Frye {{was no longer the}} rule.|$|E
