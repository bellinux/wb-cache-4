As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> {{was mostly}} re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen judges were endorsed for re-election {{by both parties}} and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to not endorse his re-election, calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for re-election in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from the profession of law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1789, the {{territory}} today known as Belgium was divided into two states, called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, both states experienced revolutions in 1789 in which <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was overthrown and new states created. These revolutions were condemned by the Holy Roman Empire and were crushed by 1792. The territory was only briefly regained, however, as the area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic. This French period lasted roughly from 1794 to 1815. In the aftermath of Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the Netherlands, and until 1830, Belgium was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|On January 3, 1894, Crispi {{declared}} a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>order</b> was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Amish, <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonites {{and other}} Pennsylvania Germans speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania German (widely called Pennsylvania Dutch, where Dutch {{is used in}} its archaic sense, thus not limited to Dutch but {{including}} all variants of German). It is a remnant {{of what was once}} a much larger German-speaking area in eastern Pennsylvania. Most of the [...] "Pennsylvania Dutch" [...] originate from the Palatinate area of Germany and their language is based on the dialect of that region. While the language is stable among <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Orders</b> and <b>the</b> number of speakers growing due to the high birth rate among <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Orders,</b> it is quickly declining among the non-plain Pennsylvania Germans (also called Fancy Dutch).|$|R

25|$|Among them, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Amish {{population}} was probably around 227,000 in 2008. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Order</b> Mennonite population, a sizable percentage {{of which is}} Pennsylvania German-speaking, numbers several tens of thousands. There are also thousands of other Mennonites who speak the dialect, as well as thousands more older Pennsylvania German speakers of non-Amish and non-Mennonite background. The Grundsau Lodge, which is an organization in southeastern Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania German speakers, {{is said to have}} 6,000 members. Therefore, a fair estimate of the speaker population today might be approaching 300,000, although many, including some academic publications, may report much lower numbers, uninformed of those diverse speaker groups.|$|E
