5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
500|$|After the Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{published}} {{a summary of}} Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as [...] "the stupid drivel {{of those who have}} only a shallow grasp of their alleged research." [...] He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as Lilith, and that [...] "we did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> merely the Goddess, but as God Herself".|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|Woodroof begins {{selling the}} {{drugs on the}} street and at gay nightclubs. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up {{business}} since she can bring many more clients. The pair establish the [...] "Dallas Buyers Club", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by a recently acquired dose of interferon, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial, while Richard Barkley of the FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs is seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Dr. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.|$|E
500|$|Naruto's romantic {{partner was}} decided {{during the early}} stages of the manga. Since Hinata Hyuga always {{respected}} Naruto, even before the series' beginning, even before Iruka Umino, Kishimoto felt they were meant to be. This angered his wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno. When Sakura was introduced, Kishimoto did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> Naruto's future wife, as he saw them as being just friends and teammates, although once Hinata had appeared, the author thought of forming a love triangle between the three characters. He later regretted the love triangle as he considered Naruto a fighting series with little focus on romance, and he reiterated that [...] "it was all about Naruto and Hinata getting married from an early stage". Later, when seeing the staff's work to focus a film on Naruto's relationship with Hinata, he decided to oversee the project. Nevertheless, he enjoyed seeing Naruto and Hinata's romantical scenes he did not write. In regards to Naruto's rank which remains as the lowest one, Genin, due to Naruto spending most of his Part II's time fighting and training, Kishimoto decided Naruto would skip the following ranks to become the Hokage, which he felt was appealing.|$|E

500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} later a fifth {{member of the group}} who {{recorded}} the encounter released the video which showed the encounter to be consensual. The 5 minute video showed Ndonye having sex with two of the men. Ndonye admitted that the sex was consensual and said that she had lied because she did not want her boyfriend to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "slut".

2500|$|One of {{his most}} {{significant}} relationships throughout the show is with Nicole Wallace, a brilliant con artist and serial killer who is first introduced in the episode [...] "Anti-Thesis". Wallace {{is one of the}} few criminals Goren encounters who is able to outwit him and even get to him emotionally, particularly by confronting him about his unhappy childhood. Goren comes to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> his [...] "white whale". When Wallace murders his brother Frank, Goren is convinced that she is trying to destroy him at last; it turns out, however, that she was manipulated and murdered by the true mastermind of the plot - his old mentor, Declan Gage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Itō's book ,'appeared in {{the series}} [...] "The Present State of Women's Poetry," [...] which was {{published}} by the Japanese publisher Shichōsha and also featured a number of rising young female poets, including Toshiko Hirata, Yōko Isaka, and Kōko Shiraishi. [...] In the mid-1980s, Itō's writing gravitated to issues of the feminine body, sexuality, and motherhood, making her the most prominent voice of {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "women's poetry boom." [...] The two collections , published in 1985, and , published in 1987, describe her feelings after giving birth to her first daughter, Kanoko Nishi. [...] These poems probe the meaning of the mother-child relationship and the demands that motherhood places on the mother's identity and sexuality. [...] For instance, in the often anthologized poem , she describes the feelings of a young mother experiencing postpartum depression and anger at her newborn, even though the world is congratulating her on becoming a mother. [...] Her eagerness to explore women's issues has led some to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> a feminist writer, although this is a term that Itō has not always embraced in building her public persona.|$|E

50|$|Eyre draws {{inspiration}} {{from what is}} unseen, and images from her dreams. She describes <b>her</b> work <b>as</b> involving the accumulation of impossible memories in an increasingly deliberate and meticulous documenting of an unreality.  While discarding her everyday life, she instead documents an invisible one and constructs an autobiography that depends less on truth than possibility. In exploring these issues of self-identity, Eyre takes a wholly intuitive approach to art-making and <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> photographs <b>as</b> automatisms. She <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> art <b>as</b> a healing process {{that can be used}} as we become increasingly alienated from our bodies and selves through advanced technology. She hopes that through her personal art she can become more connected. Janieta is more interested in exploring inner lives and <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> photographic practice <b>as</b> a sort of meditation.|$|R

50|$|The {{extent to}} which the narrator claims to have loved his animals {{suggests}} mental instability in the form of having “too much of a good thing”. His partiality for animals substitutes “the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man”. Since the narrator’s wife shares his love of animals, he likely <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> another pet, seeing as he distrusts and dislikes humans. Additionally, his failure to understand his excessive love of animals foreshadows his inability to explain his motives for his actions.|$|R
