25|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} {{has been}} identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the <b>teiids</b> (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles {{are more}} {{abundant}} and better studied. These include aquatic turtles (Glyptops, Naomichelys), {{at least one}} type of snake (Coniophis), and several different lizards, including <b>teiids</b> (Bicuspidon), possible skinks and some extinct families (e.g., Paramacellodidae). Crocodiles are also present but their remains are fragmentary. They include Bernissartia, an unnamed atoposaurid, and unnamed pholidosaurid. At least one fragment of a large pterosaur is known {{from the base of}} the Mussentuchut Member. Unfortunately, it is too incomplete to identify to family or genus.|$|E

50|$|Barbatteius is an extinct genus of teiid lizard {{represented}} by the type species Barbatteius vremiri from the Late Cretaceous of Romania. B. vremiri was named in 2015 {{on the basis of}} a well preserved skull from the Haţeg Basin and differs from other <b>teiids</b> in having more prominent osteoderms covering the skull roof. It is also large for a teiid, with an estimated total body length of 80 cm. Barbatteius lived on Haţeg Island during the early Maastrichtian stage and was part of an isolated island fauna. However, its close affinities with <b>teiids</b> from Gondwana and its co-occurrence with paramacellodid and borioteiioid lizards from Euramerica suggests that Haţeg Island was colonized by lizards multiple times from many different areas of the world.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large-scale}} phylogenetic {{analysis of}} squamates conducted by Conrad (2008) found polyglyphanodontians (called Polyglyphanodontidae by Conrad) to be {{closely related to}} teiid lizards. In the strict consensus tree recovered in the analysis, polyglyphanodontids {{were part of a}} polytomy (unresolved evolutionary relationship) with <b>teiids,</b> gymnophthalmids, Chamops and lacertids; in the Adams consensus tree polyglyphanodontids were the sister group to <b>teiids.</b> (Some other studies that recognize a close relationship between polyglyphanodontians and <b>teiids</b> use the name Borioteiioidea rather than Polyglyphanodontia, although Borioteiioidea encompasses only North American polyglyphanodontians.) Conrad's analysis also recovered Sineoamphisbaena, a Cretaceous lizard that resembles legless amphisbaenian lizards, as a member of Polyglyphanodontidae. On the other hand, a later large-scale phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living squamates published in 2012 by Gauthier et al. found that Polyglyphanodontia was not particularly closely related to <b>teiids,</b> but rather that it was the sister taxon of the clade containing the extinct marine mosasaurs, their closest relatives and the major lizard group Scleroglossa. Because the first scleroglossans appear in the Late Jurassic, polyglyphanodontians must also have originated in the Late Jurassic if this phylogeny is correct. However, polyglyphanodontians are limited to the Cretaceous, meaning that a long ghost lineage may exist. The primary analysis of Gauthier et al. (2012) did not find polyglyphanodontians and Sineoamphisbaena to be closely related; however, the authors noted that when all snake-like squamates and mosasaurs were removed from the analysis, and burrowing squamates were then added individually to it, Sineoamphisbaena grouped with polyglyphanodontians. Gauthier et al. (2012) considered it possible that Sineoamphisbaena was a burrowing polyglyphanodontian, though, agreeing with. Subsequent analyses based on [...] have also supported Sineoamphisbaenia as a polyglyphanodontian (the combined molecular and morphological analysis of Müller et al.; in the morphology only analyses carried out by Wiens et al. but not their combined molecular and morphological analyses; and in morphology only analyses carried out by [...] who were describing new polyglyphanodontians from Asia and Tianyusaurus).|$|E

Comparisons of sperm ultrastructure among these species and with those of previously examined <b>teiids</b> and gymnophthalmids revealed that {{the two groups of}} Teiioidea (Gymnophthalmidae and Teiidae), and the two subfamilies of Teiidae (Teiinae and Tupinambinae) could be distinguished on the basis of sperm ultrastructure data. Significant differences in sperm dimensions between Cnemidophorus and Aspidoscelis support the recent splitting of these two lineages into different genera. Our results revealed high levels of inter-generic variability in sperm ultrastructure within Teiidae, which produces a data set useful in analyzing relationships between genera and families. In phylogenetic analyses, however, sampling multiple species within teiid genera is essential and recording sperm measurements may profitably complement qualitative ultrastructural characters, maximizing the information content of these structures.

40|$|Differences among {{sympatric}} lizard species usually {{result from}} {{differences in the}} use of three resources: space, time and food or some combination of these three. However, differences in resource utilization among sympatric species may simply reflect their specific ecological needs rather than competitive pressures. In this study, we analyzed the temporal, spatial and food niche of two congeneric <b>teiids</b> (Cnemidophorus abaetensis and C. ocellifer) living sympatrically in the "restinga" habitat of Abaeté in the Salvador Municipality, Bahia State, Brazil to assess the degree of niche differentiation among them. The whiptail species overlapped considerably in an hourly activity (Ojk = 0. 93), in microhabitat use (Ojk = 0. 97) and in the prey items consumed (Ojk = 0. 89). Differences in amount of vegetation in the microhabitats used by both lizard species may have contributed to differences in the activity period and in the distribution of the main prey eaten by these lizards which may, in turn, facilitate their coexistence in Abaeté. Although sympatric C. ocellifer and C. abaetensis in Abaeté differed only slightly in their use of microhabitats, period of activity and diet, the most important niche dimension segregating the two species seemed to be the food niche...|$|E
