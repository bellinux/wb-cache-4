40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} four most widely-used 10 th grade literature textbooks in terms of the opportunities they provide for students to engage in coherent English language arts curricular units in which the <b>texts,</b> <b>questions,</b> and tasks provide opportunities for students to develop their own text-based interpretations and arguments, engage in focused inquiry about individual texts, and build conceptual understanding of overarching unit or text-specific concepts/questions. Data included the <b>texts,</b> <b>questions,</b> and tasks in two units per textbook, a short story unit and persuasion unit. Data analysis focused on (a) how the <b>texts,</b> <b>questions,</b> and tasks in each unit were structured to provide coherent learning opportunities that allow for students to build conceptual understanding of unit and text-specific concepts/questions, and (b) the extent to which <b>texts</b> and post-reading <b>questions</b> and tasks provide opportunities for students to develop their own text-based interpretations and arguments. The findings from this study show that despite all units including <b>texts,</b> <b>questions,</b> and tasks that cohere around overarching unit or text-specific concepts/questions, units are not structured to provide students with coherent learning opportunities {{that will allow them to}} build their conceptual understanding of unit or text-specific concepts/questions. This is due to the plethora of questions and tasks that are unrelated to the unit or text-specific concept/question or to each other. Additionally, findings show that many of the texts, especially in the persuasion units, do not provide opportunities for readers to develop multiple text-based interpretations and arguments about the ideas, arguments, characters, and events. Finally, findings show that the majority of post-reading questions in all four textbooks are recitation questions that have or assume one correct response. The findings from this study suggest that preservice and inservice educators must prepare teachers to use and modify literature textbooks in ways that are shown to improve student learning. Moreover, time must be provided in schools for teachers to work with colleagues to design instructional units that modify rather than rely on textbook units. Finally, findings from this study suggest that research is needed on how teachers use and what teachers learn from textbooks...|$|R
40|$|To {{found out}} about the {{problems}} faced these days, it is necessary to increase the mathematic achievement for MTs students particularly in completing the divided number operations in <b>text</b> <b>question</b> form, for example increasing in mathematic skill and improvement in mathematic learning study. However, though efforts has been done as maximum as it can the problems still rising since lack of students’ ability in completing <b>text</b> <b>question.</b> Improve method is one of the methods which give opportunity for the student to become more active in study and give more opportunity for the student to be able to communicate by using mathematic. Within the improve method learning, it is expected that learning focused on the teacher (teacher oriented) can be changed into focused on the student (student oriented) therefore the active rate of student can be increasing and class situation is no longer dominated only by the bright student. This experiment is using descriptive design, data collection method is using test. Experiment instrument is using test questions. Analysis done for this experiment is students’ answer sheet.

We propose a competition-based model for estimating question difficulty by leveraging pairwise comparisons between questions and users. Our experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms a PageRank-based ap-proach. Most importantly, our analysis shows that the <b>text</b> of <b>question</b> descriptions reflects the question difficulty. This implies the possibility of predicting question difficulty from the <b>text</b> of <b>question</b> descriptions...|$|R

[...] One must abandon all anger, because it is against one's Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

5000|$|The {{essence of}} Piercy’s utopian vision is social {{transformation}} achieved after the existing civilization {{had been destroyed}} through environmental degradation and war. “The transformation of existing society into utopia is a precarious enterprise attainable only {{through a process of}} making choices and crossing boundaries.” Descriptions of Mattapoisett, the potential future society described in the novel, emphasize that collective struggle has led to their egalitarian lifestyle and collective action is how they get along so well. “What is most important in Piercy's concern with activism is the basic connection between personal action and historical change itself. The revolution is not inevitable. It is a process of change that may require appropriate conditions and happen more readily at particular historical moments, but it will not happen at all without personal commitment and struggle.” The reader is left to decide whether Mattapoisett and the self-determination of its inhabitants are real or figments of Connie’s imagination. “By couching the reality of Connie's visions in ambiguity, the <b>text</b> <b>questions</b> the idealism of utopian thinking while showing that social change nevertheless starts in the realm of ideas.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Richards (1939, pp. 29-30) {{observes that}} AbaBemba“…are obsessed with {{problems}} of status and {{constantly on the}} look-out for their personal dignity, as is perhaps natural in {{a society in which}} so much depends on rank. All their human relations are dominated by rules of respect to age and position… It is probably this universal acceptance of the rights of rank that makes the Bemba appear so submissive and almost servile to the European… Arrogant towards other tribes, and touchy towards their fellows, they seem to endure in silence any kind of treatment from a chief (sic, should read ‘monarch’) or a European.To my mind their most attractive characteristics are quick sympathy and adaptability in human relationships, an elaborate courtesy and sense of etiquette, and great polish of speech. A day spent at the Paramount’s (sic, should read ‘King’) court is apt to make a European observer's manners seem crude and boorish by contrast.” (pp. 139-140)Mukuka (2013, pp. 139-140), observes that"With the introduction of the English polity in the (Northern Rhodesia) colony, the long established Bemba civilization and its intrinsic psychological realities were disrupted. For many abaBemba, the arbitrary amalgamation of 70-plus ethnic groups meant 1) a new identity, incomprehensible and groundless; 2) fears of loss of what they had known (politically, socially and economically) about managing their lives; and, 3) new centres of power (political, social, and cultural) that they had to learn to navigate. Insaka and ifibwanse, the long-established centres for educating Bemba boys and girls respectively lost their power to western schools that promised successful learners the social status next to that of the ‘white’ colonisers. Bemba cultural practices and ideals were harshly judged by both colonisers and Christian missionaries. Consequently, abaBemba asked: who are we in Northern Rhodesia? What is our place in this new amalgam? How do we fit in? Taking advantage of the written <b>text,</b> <b>questions</b> of who we are, where we are, and how we fit in found expression in Bemba literature; particularly, the over twenty documented Bemba factual novels..."

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have aimed to {{demonstrate}} that specific types of reading comprehension depend on different underlying cognitive abilities. In these studies, it is often implicitly assumed that reading comprehension is a multidimensional construct. The general {{aim of this study}} was to examine the dimensionality of a large pool of reading comprehension items differing according to <b>text</b> and <b>question</b> type. The items were administered to 996 fourth-grade children. We used multitrait, multimethod modeling to test for the existence of specific <b>text</b> and <b>question</b> types. In addition, the correlations of factor scores, reflecting the different measures of reading comprehension, with word reading speed, vocabulary, and working memory were examined. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the specific measures of comprehension, differing according to <b>text</b> and <b>question</b> type, hardly reflected systematic variation, after a general factor of reading comprehension was taken into account. Reading comprehension items thus largely reflect a common factor. Factor scores that were supposed to reflect specific comprehension factors were not reliable and were hardly related to word reading speed, vocabulary, and working memory...|$|R
