500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{made his}} NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 {{loss to the}} Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from {{incurring}} a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when {{he was supposed to}} drop into coverage. When told by Parcells <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded [...] "Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play's a dandy." [...] He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season {{is considered one of the}} best in NFL history. He was named 1981's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him [...] the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.|$|E
2500|$|Iliadis auditioned {{dozens of}} actors before he hired Garret Dillahunt {{for the role}} of Krug, the leader of the family that kidnaps Mari. According to Iliadis, the actors coming in kept trying to portray Krug as the [...] "typical bad guy", and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> the {{director}} wanted. In Iliadis's opinion, [...] "the most sadistic criminal will smile"; when Dillahunt came in he brought a slyness to the character, and created [...] "ambiguity and subtleties" [...] to the character that Iliadis liked. Dillahunt attempted to humanize Krug by approaching the character more as a man who feels some love for his son, but is bitter about how his life has turned out and is fearful that he is losing his position as the leader. He further clarifies that Krug fails to take responsibility for his own actions, instead blaming others, and prefers to deliver his own [...] "twisted justice" [...] to those he feels have wronged him.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Fender {{teamed up}} with fellow Tex–Mex musicians Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados, whose work meshed conjunto, Tejano, R, country, and blues to wide acclaim. When the Texas Tornados went to {{audition}} for Warner Bros. Records, Fender {{did not think that}} the group was strong enough, so he brought his own band. The audition was nearly a bust, because he played country music and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> the executives were looking for. Fender was persuaded to play some vintage rock and blues numbers which was what the executives were looking for, and was subsequently given a record contract. After being a solo act, Fender was not sure if signing with a group was a good thing, but according to Fender, he [...] "just wanted to record for a major label." [...] The group released four albums and won a Grammy in 1990 for Best Mexican American Performance for the track [...] "Soy de San Luis". Fender described the group in this way: [...] "You've heard of New Kids on the Block? Well, we're the Old Guys in the Street." [...] Following the death of Sahm, the Tornados' production slowed. A live 1990 appearance on TV's Austin City Limits, one of three the group made, was released in 2005 as part of the Live From Austin, Texas, series.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Emperor Wenzong {{summoned the}} senior officials, {{including}} {{the heads of}} the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them as to what they opined. [...] A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (崔玄亮), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (王質), Lu Jun (盧均), Shu Yuanbao (舒元褒), Jiang Xi (蔣係), Pei Xiu (裴休), and Wei Wen (韋溫), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. [...] Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. [...] Cui bowed and wept, stating, [...] "One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor." [...] Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. [...] Niu then stated, [...] "The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. [...] If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, and why would he pursue that? [...] Surely <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> he was planning." [...] Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled.|$|E
