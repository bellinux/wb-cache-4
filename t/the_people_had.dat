5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|This line of {{argument}} follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> the right to resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E

Some of the important components of the second State Constitution include {{the separation of the}} powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

25|$|Malachi also criticizes his {{audience}} for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting {{them to be}} faithful as they await that justice.

Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been neglecting to offer their full tithe to Elohim.

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> already {{experienced}} mass deportations, {{they knew}} the signs (such as arrival of fresh troops and vehicles) and attempted to hide. Therefore, the Soviets set up ambushes, tracked down and interrogated relatives, carried out mass passport checks, etc. Against regulations, MGB operatives would deliver children without parents to the train stations hoping that the parents would voluntarily show up. Not all fugitives were caught by such measures and later, in Lithuania, smaller actions and deportations were organized to locate those that escaped the first Operation Priboi in March.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the word}} of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying that God had made a {{covenant}} with the Israelites' forefathers when God brought them out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage that in the seventh year they must let every Hebrew slave go free, but their forefathers did not listen. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> turned and done what is right in God's eyes, proclaiming liberty to their neighbors, making a covenant before God in the Temple. But the people turned again and profaned God's name, causing their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation as servants once again. Therefore, God said that as <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> not listened to God to proclaim liberty to their neighbors, God would proclaim for the people liberty to the sword, pestilence, and famine, and would make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. God would give over to their enemies the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, the priests, and all the people of the land who had transgressed God's covenant, who had sealed the covenant by cutting a calf in half and passing between the two parts of the calf, and their dead bodies would be food for scavengers. And God would give Zedekiah and his princes into the hand of the king of Babylon, who would return to burn Jerusalem and lay desolate the cities of Judah.|$|E
25|$|Justice {{was mostly}} a local {{matter in the}} Chola Empire, where minor {{disputes}} were settled at the village level.

Crimes of the state such as treason were heard and decided by the king himself and the typical punishment in such cases was either execution or confiscation of property. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> to agree to the king in these situations, no matter what.|$|E
