Based on empirical data collected from smallholder rubber producers in the Nucleus Estate Smallholder (NES) development project, estimations were made of the economic feasibility of integrating sheep and selected crops into smallholder rubber production plantations. The dynamic optimization procedure is used as an evaluation technique. This study finds that integration of sheep and crops into smallholder rubber production is economically feasible, particularly for those who utilize family labor for hand harvesting <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazing</b> sheep. Integrating sheep alone increases the net present value of future income by 20 %. The combination of sheep and soybeans with smallholder rubber production increases the net present value of future income by 38 %. bioeconomic model, diversification, dynamic optimization, Indonesia, rubber, sheep, smallholder, Farm Management,...|$|R

40|$|Leguminous {{plants have}} long been {{considered}} important as livestock feeds in Hawaii. They decrease the need for costly oil cakes and protein rich concentrates in milk and meat production. Indigofera endecapliylla Jacq. (creeping indigo or trailing indigo) seemed promising for a time as a high-rainfall-zone legume. Early experiments proved that it would grow well {{with a wide variety}} of associated <b>grasses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazing</b> tests showed that it was palatable and quite persistent under pasture conditions. Very little was known, on the other hand, of its feeding value for livestock. In 10 years of short-interval pasture trials with relatively small proportions of the legume, no adverse effects were noted on young cattle. However, when the concentration of the legume exceeded about 50 per cent of the forage, toxicity symptoms began to appear. A study of the effect of a strain of Indigofera endecapliylla Jacq. grown in Hawaii and tested as a feed for cows, heifers, sheep, and rabbits is presented...|$|R
40|$|Aridification {{is often}} {{considered}} a major driver of long-term ecological change and hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene; however, this hypothesis remains inadequately tested owing to difficulties in reconstructing terrestrial paleoclimate. We present a revised aridity index for quantifying water deficit (WD) in terrestrial environments using tooth enamel δ 18 O values, and use {{this approach to}} address paleoaridity over the past 4. 4 million years in eastern Africa. We find no long-term trend in WD, consistent with other terrestrial climate indicators in the Omo-Turkana Basin, and no relationship between paleoaridity and herbivore paleodiet structure among fossil collections meeting the criteria for WD estimation. Thus, we suggest that changes in the abundance of C 4 <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazing</b> herbivores in eastern Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene may have been decoupled from aridity. As in modern African ecosystems, other factors, such as rainfall seasonality or ecological interactions among plants and mammals, may be important for understanding the evolution of C 4 grass- and grazer-dominated biomes...|$|R
40|$|Grassland based systems offer farmers {{the three}} pillars of sustainability: economic, {{environmental}} and social.

Economic success in grazing systems is defined by pasture utilisation which, in turn is positively affected by pasture availability and stocking rate (cows/ha) and negatively affected by the amount of feed purchased. Success in this regard will need to build on that principle by growing <b>and</b> utilising more <b>grass</b> per hectare, converting the grass as efficiently as possible into saleable product with a labour and capital efficient system of milk production.

He sold 350 acre to William Mason in 1851 for 500 pounds, but the deed for the land was not {{processed}} until 6 September 1852. The land included most of the peninsula apart from what is now Musick Point, which was reserved for the crown. Originally Eastern Beach was named Masons Beach. He sowed fine English <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazed</b> mainly sheep. In 1850 William Mason was elected {{one of the three}} wardens of the Howick [...] "hundred". The [...] "hundred" [...] was an ancient English administrative unit. He was one of three wardens who decided how the income gained for licenses to grazing cattle would be spent. The term hundred only lasted until 1865, when it was changed to Highway Trustees. Mason bought the first flour windmill built in 1843 by John Bycroft in Auckland at Epsom (on the corner of Mindmill Rd and St Andrews Rd). Because it was some distance from the wheat farmers in the Howick district, some of them made simple mortars and pestles to grind their own flour. Later Mason moved the mill to Princess St. Onehunga in 1854, where there was a natural spring.|$|R

Eravur, Vantharumoolai and Karadiyanaru were selected for urban, village and remote areas respectively. Fifty farmers were interviewed in each DS division. Stratified random sampling method was used to select the farmers and totally 150 farmers were interviewed. Majority of the farmers in urban area were small holders but majority of village and remote area farmers were medium holders. Most of the farmers in whole study area were practicing extensive or semi intensive rearing system. Most of the farmers reported that major constraints were high cost for concentrate feeds <b>and</b> lack of <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazing</b> land. Paddy straw, rice bran, fodders, <b>grasses</b> kitchen wastes <b>and</b> crop residues were the major available feeds in whole study area. Paddy straw was used by more than 70 % of the farmers in each study area. Suitable conditions for feed production and high availability of feeds in the region were the acceptable merits to the cattle rearing. Lack of pasture and fodder production, increasing cost for concentrate feeds, lack of knowledge about preparation of conserved feed materials (urea treated straw, urea molasses multi-nutrient block and silage), less adoption of improved management practices and non-utilization of non-leguminous tree leaves were the major limitations prevailing in the study area...|$|R

30|$|As {{many of the}} rangelands on Earth are {{situated}} in dry areas, soil moisture is amongst the most important variables to be monitored using remote-sensing technologies. An important measure of rangeland functioning is moisture level in the vegetation canopy, an expression of its physiological status. The complementary measure is the soil moisture content. Long periods of dry soil {{and low levels of}} canopy moisture, as well as more readily detectable decreases in leaf area index (LAI), can imply a deteriorating ecosystem due to drought impact. Decreases in LAI and canopy moisture can, therefore, provide important information on the health of plants and on drying processes due to drought years or climatic change. Since plants are expected to dry out slowly before mortality (Claudio et al. 2006), it is useful to monitor LAI and water content in the canopy. The remote-sensing data (hyperspectral and multispectral data) have been used in several studies for accurate estimation of canopy water content of <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazed</b> fen meadow (Clevers et al. 2010). Canopy moisture assessment includes attempts to estimate daily evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes at the catchment scale from NOAA AVHRR data (Kustas et al. 1994). The addition of two spectral bands calibrated to the short-wave infrared portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) provided the ability to monitor leaf moisture (Tucker 1980; Hunt Jr and Rock 1989) as well as identify and map recent wildfires (Chuvieco and Congalton 1988; Key and Benson 1999).|$|R

With a population growth rate of well over 5 percent, the demand for cereal crops and animal products will continue to increase substantiality. This requires an early intervention strategy to ensure an adequate supply of these products to the urban dwellers. This paper looks into urban livestock production in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with particular emphasis on the role of women. It indicates that in Ethiopia, 45 percent of livestock owners are women and that 33 percent of the livestock keepers households are headed by women in Addis Ababa city. Women are usually responsible for feeding large animals, cleaning the barns, milking dairy cattle, processing milk and marketing livestock products, but they receive assistance of men, female children and/or other relatives, younger children, especially girls between the ages of 7 and 15, are mostly responsible for managing calves, chickens and small ruminants and older boys are responsible for treating sick animals, constructing shelters, cutting <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> <b>grazing</b> of cattle <b>and</b> small ruminants. The role of women in managing animals that are confined during most of the year is substantial and they are critically involved in removing and managing manure, which is often made into cakes and used or sold as fuel.
