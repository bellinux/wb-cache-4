5|$|Joyce and {{the others}} learned the fate of Mackintosh and Hayward only when they were finally able to reach Cape Evans in July. Joyce {{immediately}} set about organising searches for traces of the missing men; in the subsequent months parties were sent to search the coasts and the islands in McMurdo Sound, but to no avail. Joyce also organised journeys to recover geological samples left on the Barrier and to visit the grave of Spencer-Smith, where a large cross was erected. In {{the absence of the}} ship, the seven remaining survivors lived quietly, until on 10 January 1917, the refitted Aurora arrived with Shackleton aboard to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> They learned then that their depot-laying efforts had been futile, Shackleton's ship Endurance having been crushed by the Weddell Sea ice nearly two years previously.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E
25|$|A one-way ferry trip {{currently}} costs $1.75 per person. It can be paid at Newburgh {{and during}} the AM Rush only at Beacon or on board. The MTA, as is its practice, not only sells train tickets at the ferry terminals but encourages riders to buy them there. For regular riders, a UniTicket package combining train and ferry fare for a month is available for $321. UniTicket purchasers are also covered by MTA's Guaranteed Ride Home program, whereby if the ferry is unable to operate {{they will be able}} to get a taxi to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> or to their cars.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, {{with winter}} approaching, President Theodore Roosevelt sent Dagenett to Thunder Butte, South Dakota, {{to deal with}} a band of {{starving}} White River Ute who had left their reservation in protest against allotment and Mormon encroachments on their land. They asked the government to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home,</b> but Dagenett helped them set up a winter camp and made them work for their passage. He got them hired on the construction of a railroad in the Black Hills, and as the wages were good, many stayed on until summer. During his career, Dagenett made official trips to Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America.|$|E
25|$|Carpathia docked at 9:30p.m. on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and {{was greeted}} by some 40,000people waiting at the {{quayside}} in heavy rain. Immediate relief {{in the form of}} clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations. Many of Titanics surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home,</b> and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. Titanics 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer , where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.|$|E
25|$|The King was a keen sportsman and {{religious}} preacher in his youth. He was educated at Newington College and studied Law at Sydney University while resident at Wesley College in Sydney, Australia. He was appointed Minister of Education by Queen Sālote in 1943, Minister of Health in 1944, and in 1949, Premier. He remained a lay preacher of the Free Wesleyan Church until his death, {{and in some}} circumstances, was empowered to appoint an acting church president. In the 1970s, he was the heaviest monarch in the world, weighing in at over 200kg (440 pounds or 31 stones). For his visits to Germany, the German Government used to commission special chairs that could support his weight. The King used to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home,</b> considering them as state presents. In the 1990s, he {{took part in a}} national fitness campaign, losing a third of his weight.|$|E

500|$|After the {{construction}} of a new Astrometrics lab, the crew enter Krenim space and go through the [...] "Year of Hell" [...] foretold in the [...] episode [...] "". But the events of this year are undone with the destruction of the Krenim timeship. Voyager continues to encounter the Borg and enters Hirogen space, establishing contact with Starfleet for the first time since being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. The crew are cloned by an intelligent silver liquid on a demon class planet and the season ends with an alien seeking revenge who tries to trick the crew with a fake Starfleet vessel that can <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> to Earth.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|On 19 May, {{two days}} after the {{celebrations}} for Norway's National Day, Fram passed 81°, indicating that the ship's northerly speed was slowly increasing, though it was still barely a mile (1.6km) a day. [...] With a growing conviction that a sledge journey might be necessary to reach the pole, in September Nansen decreed that everyone would practice skiing for two hours a day. [...] On 16 November he revealed his intention to the crew: he and one companion would leave the ship and start for the pole when the 83° mark was passed. After reaching the pole the pair would make for Franz Josef Land, and then cross to Spitsbergen where they hoped to find a ship to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> Three days later Nansen asked Hjalmar Johansen, the most experienced dog-driver among the crew, to join him on the polar journey.|$|E
25|$|As the war {{turned against}} Nazi Germany, the Danish king Christian X secured {{the release of}} the Danish internees from Theresienstadt on April 15, 1945. The White Buses, {{organised}} in cooperation with the Swedish Red Cross, collected the 413 who had survived and <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the final}} game at Cleveland Stadium in December 1995, members of the Dawg Pound ripped the bleachers from the stands (many having brought wrenches, crowbars, and other tools to {{dislodge}} the seats).

Throughout the video, Maialino is shown love, affection and overall happiness.|$|R
500|$|The first Monopoly tournaments were {{suggested}} by Victor Watson of Waddington after the World Chess Championship 1972. Such championships are also held for {{players of the}} board game Scrabble. The first European Championship was held in Reykjavík, Iceland, the same site as the 1972 World Chess Championship. Accounts differ as to the eventual winner: Philip Orbanes and Victor Watson name John Mair, representing Ireland and the eventual World Monopoly Champion of 1975, as also having won the European Championship. Gyles Brandreth, himself a later European Monopoly Champion, names Pierre Milet, representing France, as the European Champion. One of the reasons there may be differing accounts of the eventual winner is attributable to a minor controversy with the final game. According to Parker Brothers' Randolph [...] "Ranny" [...] P. Barton, an error was made {{by one of the}} participants and a protest was filed by an opponent. The judges (Barton, Watson, and a representative from Miro, the French publishers of Monopoly) weighed the options of starting the final game over and delaying the chartered plane that would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> from Iceland vs allowing the game to stand with the error but allowing them to make their flight. In the end, the judges upheld the result of the game with the error uncorrected.|$|E
500|$|The {{first weeks}} in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably, {{sometimes}} north, sometimes south; by 19 November Fram's latitude was south of that at which she had entered the ice. Only {{after the turn of}} the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80° mark was finally passed on 22 March. Nansen calculated that, at this rate, it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a mile (1.6km) a day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan—a dog sledge journey towards the pole. With this in mind he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice. [...] In November Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83° he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship with the dogs and make for the pole while Fram, under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped Franz Josef Land. They would then cross to Spitzbergen where they would find a ship to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
60|$|The skipper {{was about}} to repeat it with great {{readiness}} when Miss Evans raised her trusty mop.

2500|$|In 2006, due {{to rising}} rent in Downtown Austin, theater owners {{took steps to}} hand the theater over to a {{non-profit}} group called the [...] "Heroes of the Alamo" [...] foundation, operating the theater as a cultural arts center. However, with the historic Ritz Theater on 6th Street offered as an alternative location, the original Alamo was closed. The final event at the original location consisted of a special triple-feature event the evening of June 27, 2007. The final movie shown was Night Warning, with star Susan Tyrrell attending. [...] At {{the conclusion of the}} movie, audience members were allowed to disassemble their seats and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> as mementos of the theater.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1877, ten Ponca chiefs, {{including}} Standing Bear, accompanied Inspector Edward C. Kemble to Indian Territory to view several {{tracts of}} land. After viewing {{lands on the}} Osage Reservation and the Kaw Reservation, the chiefs were unhappy with what they were shown, and asked to return home without looking at the Quapaw Reservation. Angry at {{what he called the}} Ponca chiefs' [...] "insubordination," [...] Kemble refused to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> until they had viewed all the land. Instead, eight of the chiefs decided to return home on foot. Kemble visited the Quapaw Reservation and selected it as the removal destination. In April, Kemble headed south to the Quapaw Reservation near present-day Peoria, Oklahoma, with those Ponca willing to leave. [...] In May, the remainder of the tribe was forced to move, including Standing Bear and his family.|$|E
2500|$|By March the Grants visited Constantinople and Greece, transported {{there by}} the USS Vandalia. During his visit with the Sultan, Grant was very {{impressed}} with his stable of purebred Arabian stallions. Grant commented that the stallions would [...] "pick up their feet like a cat, and so quickly, {{that no one can}} scarcely follow their motions". Grant was so impressed with the animals that the flattered Sultan allowed him to pick out any two he desired and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>home,</b> which he did – a [...] "dappled gray" [...] and an [...] "iron gray", which were promptly shipped back to New York. During his visit, Grant was impressed when he learned how thoroughly Ottoman officers had studied the various military campaigns under his command. However, such praise and his gifts did not prevent Grant from criticizing the class and gender divisions he saw. He would later write that he believed the Turkish government treated its people [...] "as slaves" [...] and noting that [...] "they have a form of government that will always repress progress and development." ...|$|E
