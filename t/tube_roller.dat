40|$|AbstractThe {{colonization}} of laboratory-made aggregates by the filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Beggiatoa leptomitiformis, was investigated {{over a period}} of 14 days during winter and spring. The aggregates were generated from natural water from the freshwater zone of the Elbe Estuary using a tilting <b>tube</b> <b>roller.</b> Experiments were carried out under natural environmental conditions in a climate chamber. Within one hour after the beginning of the experiments, macroaggregates had already started to form. They reached a maximum size of 1 mm during the experiments. Both in winter and in spring, the water in which aggregates developed remained well saturated with oxygen. From {{the first day of the}} experiments, the sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Beggiatoa leptomitiformis, was detected living in the aggregates and in the surrounding water. In the aggregates, the number of these bacteria was in the order of 106 ml− 1, whereas in the surrounding water, they were three orders of magnitude less abundant. In addition to the sulfur-oxidizing Beggiatoa, sulfate-reducing bacteria were detected within the aggregates...|$|E

Results were as follows; Each tube showed constantly uniform titers. Long-time HA curves were obtained through relay of several tubes. Multiplication of the virus on <b>roller</b> <b>tubes</b> showed similar sequences to multiplication in chorioallantoic cavities of embryonated eggs, irrespective of inoculum doses. For the cultivation of influenza virus, minced chorioallantoic membrane seemed to give the results as compared to minced bodies or minced brains of chick embryo. HA activity of influenza virus was not very stable. Addition of potassium chloride 0. 6 grm. per liter to the Tyrode 2 ̆ 7 s solution increased its stability, whereas calcium chloride did not. From result of examination, in Fig. 6. HA curves showed like a step by increased potassium chloride, it seems that unevenness of HA curves except one step growth of virus is caused by lability of HA activity, Tyrode 2 ̆ 7 s, Hanks 2 ̆ 7 and Earle 2 ̆ 7 s as nutrient solution, were nearly equal for cultivation of influenza virus. <b>Roller</b> <b>tube</b> method gave HA titers approximately four to eight times higher than stationary method...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objectives: Needleless electrospinning {{technology}} surmounts {{the shortcomings}} and bottlenecks {{of the conventional}} needle based electrospinning systems. Spinneret clogging and lower throughput in terms of productivity has been the setbacks of the conventional technology leading to fewer nanofibers based commercial products. Nanofiber based products finds a market in healthcare, energy and defence. Proof of concept leading to lab level prototype scaling up into industrial level of nanofiber production units {{is the focus of}} this paper. Methodology/Analysis: A simple search in the scopus web portal with a keyword 'electrospinning' resulted in 16, 272 publications as of date. Same search for patent in US patent office portal resulted in 1939 granted patent documents. A comparison of years of technology time cycle (110 years), publications (16, 272) and granted patents (1939) with the companies (31) working on electrospun products was made. Findings: Bubble, hollow <b>tube,</b> <b>roller,</b> wire based and slit-surface needleless electrospinning units are discussed on the basis of entrepreneurial product cycle of prototype development translating into commercial units. Nanofiber production at a mean diameter of 140 nm at commercial level using Poly (ethylene) oxide for Nano Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS) by wire based free surface electrospinning has been analysed. Novelty/Improvements: The analysis proves an entrepreneurial approach in the area of electrospinning as evidenced by number of patents match ups or exceeds publications in some region and also depicts its futuristic demand in several areas including healthcare and energy sectors...|$|E
40|$|Analysis and {{development}} of the existing method of calculation of the calibrated profile of the working strips mills CTRR roller cold rolling pipe to ensure the required distribution of energy-power parameters along the cone. In presented paper, which has for aim the development of existing method for calculating the profile of calibrated working plank in the cold <b>tube</b> <b>roller</b> rolling mills, the analysis had been made and it was proposed to use Besier-lines while building the the profile of the plank working surface. It was established that the use of Besier spline-curve for calculating the calibration of supporting planks creates the possibility to calculate the parameters proceeding from reduction over the external diameter. The proposed method for calculating deformation parameters in CTRR mills is the result of development of existing method and as such shows the scientific novelty. Comparison of the plots for distribution of the force parameters of the CTRR process along the cone of deformation presents as evidence the advantage of the method to be proposed. The decrease of reduction value at the end of deformation zone favors the manufacture of tubes with lesser wall thickness deviation (especially longitudinal one, caused with waviness induced by the cold pilgering process). Joined the further development of the method of calculating the deformation parameters CTRR. It is proposed for the calculation of the calibration work surface support bracket mills CTRR to use a spline Bezier. The practical significance of the proposed method consists in the fact that calculation of all zones of the plank by means of one dependence allows simplifying the process of manufacturing the latter in machines with programmed numerical control. In this case the change of reduction parameters over the thickness of the wall will not exert the considerable influence on the character of the force parameters (the character and not the value) distribution along the cone of deformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{invasive}} properties of bacteria have frequently been studied {{by the use}} of HeLa cell cultures in chamber slides, using microscopic examination to enumerate intracellular bacteria. When this system was used to examine invasive properties of Yersinia enterocolitica, it resulted in rapid internalization of high numbers of bacteria during the infection phase which prevented subsequent discrimination of intracellular multiplication. A modified procedure was developed which standardized the ratio of bacteria to HeLa cells (i. e., multiplicity), the time for the infection phase, and the addition of specific antiserum with gentamicin for restricting bacterial uptake during the intracellular growth phase. Studies with this modified chamber slide system found that strains of human isolates of Y. enterocolitica (serotypes O: 3, O: 8, O: 5, 27, and O: 6, 30) exhibited different degrees of cell infection but did not multiply intracellularly. A second test system was developed that used <b>roller</b> <b>tubes</b> and viable cell counts for the enumeration of intracellular bacteria. This <b>roller</b> <b>tube</b> system confirmed that internalized bacteria did not multiply inside HeLa cells over a 24 -h period.

50|$|StrongBoard {{balance is}} a one piece {{apparatus}} with the springs connected between a base and platform. Unlike traditional balance trainers, {{there is no}} <b>tube</b> or <b>roller,</b> which prevents the board from sliding out from underneath or coming apart. Due to this, StrongBoard balance is safer to balance on than other balance boards. StrongBoard Balance’s effectiveness lies in patented multi spring technology which prevents stabilization from occurring when body weight is applied. Through employing various balance techniques, StrongBoard Balance works to strengthen the core, strengthen stabilizing muscles and build neuropathic communication. By not allowing stabilization, the user’s muscles never stops working. With a design consisting of a solid base and a flat top, StrongBoard Balance is an effective tool for exercises including pushups, step ups, squats, and many others.|$|R

In this paper, the forward flow forming process is simulated using the finite element method and its results are compared with the experimental process. The variation of thickness of the sample is examined by the ultrasonic tests for the five locations of the tubes. To simulate the process, the ABAQUS explicit is used. The effects of flow forming variables such as the angle of rollers and rate of feeding of rollers, on the external variables such as internal diameter, thickness of <b>tube</b> and <b>roller</b> forces are considered. The study showed that the roller force and surface defects were reduced with low feeding rate and low rollers attack angles.
