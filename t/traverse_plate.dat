A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the drive gear, the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the drive gear rotates, the <b>traversing</b> <b>plate</b> is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity.

40|$|If a {{monochromatic}} {{and coherent}} light beam is normally incident on a thin plate under generalized plane-stress conditions, it is analysed into two plane-polarized bundles, whose directions of oscillation {{coincide with the}} principal stress directions. The plane-polarized rays are retarded when <b>traversing</b> the <b>plate</b> according to the Neumann-Maxwell law. The absolute variations of the optical paths depend on the thickness and the refractive index variations. Interference of the two primary reflections from {{the front and rear}} faces of the plate yields a contour map of the thickness and refractive index in the unloaded state, while the variation of the interference pattern express the variations of these quantities due to loading. If the incident light is successively polarized along either of the principal directions, the interference pattern of the reflected light rays along each direction yields the values of principal stresses. Loading of the specimen creates a displacement of the interference fringes along the field. By counting the number of fringes passing across each point, we can evaluate separately the two principal stresses. This pointwise method is much more sensitive and accurate than classical photoelasticity, since it measures absolute variations of the optical path. The method was applied to a concrete problem of elasticity and compared with other similar methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{governing}} {{differential equation}} of motion for an undamped thin rectangular plate {{with a number of}} bonded piezoelectric patches on its surface and arbitrary boundary conditions is derived using Hamilton’s principle. A moving mass traveling on an arbitrary trajectory acts as an external excitation for the system. The effect of the moving mass inertia is considered using all the out-of-plane translational acceleration components. The method of eigenfunction expansion is used to transform the {{equation of motion}} into a number of coupled ordinary differential equations. A classical closed-loop optimal control algorithm is employed to suppress the dynamic response of the system, determining the required voltage of each piezoactuator at any time interval. In a numerical example for a simply supported square plate under two different loading paths, the effect of the mass velocity and mass weight of the moving load on the dynamic behavior of the uncontrolled system is investigated. The results show that, depending on the path of the moving mass, the inertia effect is very important, causing different behaviors of the system. In addition, the number of vibrational modes involved in determining the dynamic response of the system is crucial. The inertia effect is more important for an orbiting mass loading case compared to the case in which the moving mass is <b>traversing</b> the <b>plate</b> on a straight line. A number of equally spaced piezo patches are used on the lower surface of the plate to control the displacement of the center point of the plate. The implemented control mechanism proves to be very efficient in suppressing the near resonant dynamic response of the system, requiring fairly low levels of voltage for each patch. Increasing the area of the employed piezo patches would reduce the required maximum voltage for controlling the response of the system...|$|R
40|$|X-band {{radiation}} {{has been}} observed which occurs when an electron beam travelling in air <b>traverses</b> an aluminum <b>plate.</b> The radiation pattern {{is more complicated than}} can be explained with a simplified model of Cerenkov radiation from air and transition radiation from the aluminum-air interface. The empirical observation is that the peak angle decreases with energy until about 70 MeV, then increases with energy. The angular width of the peak distribution shows a similar behavior with energy. The observed peak angle decreases as the distance from the horn antenna to the aluminum foil is increased. The explanation of the radiation distribution observed is not yet satisfactory. A major improvement in the data accumulation process has been introduced by measuring radiation at a fixed angle as data is taken with a movable horn. This procedure allows us to compensate for the fluctuating electron beam intensity. The data can now be digitized and stored in a computer for analysis. Previous experiments allowed only for analog measurements. Further work, both theoretical and experimental, will be required to understand fully the radiation signature of the electron beam.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanisms of}} alphafetoprotein (AFP) transfer across the human placenta by correlating measurements of AFP transfer with cytochemical localization of AFP. Placental cotyledons were dually perfused in vitro with either the fetal or maternal perfusate containing umbilical cord plasma {{as a source of}} AFP. Steady state AFP clearance, corrected for release of endogenous AFP, was 0. 973 +/- 0. 292 microliter/min per gram in the fetal to maternal direction (n = 10), significantly higher (P < 0. 02) than that in the maternal to fetal direction (n = 5; 0. 022 +/- 0. 013 microliter/min per gram). Clearance of a similarly sized protein, horseradish peroxidase was also asymmetric but clearance of the small tracer creatinine was not. Using a monoclonal antibody, we localized AFP to fibrinoid deposits in regions of villi with discontinuities of the syncytiotrophoblast, to cytotrophoblast cells in these deposits, to syncytiotrophoblast on some villi, and to trophoblast cells in the decidua. We conclude that AFP transfer in the placenta is asymmetric and that there are two available pathways for AFP transfer: (a) from the fetal circulation into the villous core and across fibrinoid deposits at discontinuities in the villous syncytiotrophoblast to enter the maternal circulation; and (b) AFP present in the decidua could enter vessels that <b>traverse</b> the basal <b>plate...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} spinal cord and hindbrain consist of a motor basal plate and a sensory alar plate. This assumption was tested in the chicken embryo by mapping the expression of cadherin- 7 and cadherin- 6 B, in comparison to genetic markers of ventrodorsal patterning (Otp, Pax 6, Pax 7, Nkx 2. 2, Shh) and markers for specific motoneuron subpopulations (Phox 2 b, Islet- 1, and Lim 3 /Lhx 4). Results show that cadherin- 7 is expressed in a complete radial domain, which occupies the dorsal region of the basal plate. The dorsal limit of this cadherin- 7 domain coincides with the ventral border of Pax 7 expression, i. e. with the basal/alar plate boundary. The branchiomotor neurons of the chicken hindbrain are born at a medial position close to the floor plate. They extend a cadherin- 7 -positive axon that grows laterally and exits the hindbrain from the alar plate. Following this axonal trajectory, the cadherin- 7 -positive neuronal cell bodies translocate laterally {{to pass through the}} cadherin- 7 -positive basal plate domain. Subsequently, the cell bodies <b>traverse</b> the basal/alar <b>plate</b> boundary and assume their final position in the alar plate. After migration is completed, branchiomotor neurons switch expression from cadherin- 7 to cadherin- 6 B. These findings demonstrate that a specific subset of primary motor neurons, the branchiomotor neurons, migrate into the alar plate of the chicken embryo. Consequently, the century-old concept that all primary motor neurons come to reside in the basal plate should be revised...|$|R

The step heights varied between 0. 1 in. and 0. 9 in., and the steps could be <b>traversed</b> along the <b>plate</b> surface to vary the distance from the leading edge Three stream static pressure levels (P 0) were chosen: 30, 50 and 70 microns of mercury, giving Reynolds numbers per inch between 98 and 281 [...] Initially the flat plate without step was investigated and it is shown that the pressure increase caused by the thick, rapidly-growing boundary layer could be estimated reasonably well over the front part of the plate by a tangent-wedge theory. Over the rear part of the plate this estimate was too high. Near the front of the plate the viscous interaction effect was in broad agreement with other tests at M o = 4 if the correlation was made in terms of the hypersonic parameter Z. The plate boundary layer was explored with a small pitot tube and its growth with distance from the leading edge was found to correspond to a simple law of familiar form. The approximate velocity distribution within the boundary layer was also deduced and is shown to be similar to the theoretical profile for a laminar boundary layer on an insulated plate at M o [...] 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been the design and {{demonstration}} of refractive devices, not only for acoustic waves, but also for flexural waves in thin plates. Mathematically these problems have been treated {{by means of the}} multiple scattering theory, because the geometries of the problems were mainly circular and such theory is the best one in these cases. The multiple scattering theory, previously stated, is here explained. Additionally, a multilayer scattering theory for flexural waves is here introduced and successfully used to numerically simulate their behavior. Therefore, this PhD thesis is divided in two parts. The first part is devoted to describe two acoustic refractive devices: a gradient index lens and an omnidirectional broadband acoustic absorber, or “acoustic black hole”. Both are based on sonic crystals consisting of of rigid cylinders immersed in a fluid background. As the homogenization method states, the desired refractive index can be obtained by tailoring the radii of the cylinders. Thereafter, numerical simulations and measurements were conducted to test the behavior of each device. For this purpose, two specific measuring systems were developed: the two-dimensional chamber and the impedance chamber. Both are here explained in detail. The second part describes the design of refractive devices for flexural waves. Instead of using “platonic crystals”, we made use of the peculiar dispersion relationship of flexural waves. As the equation states, the wave speed is modified not only by the elastic properties of the plate, but also from its thickness. Using the latest approach a set of numerical simulations of known circularly symmetrical gradient index lenses have been performed. Additionally, an omnidirectional broadband insulating device for flexural waves has been designed. It consist of a well-like thickness profile in an annular region of the plate, that mimics the combination of an attractive and repulsive potentials. The waves are focused at its bottom and dissipated by means of an absorptive layer placed on top. Numerical simulations are here presented and discussed. Finally, we present an in-plane flexural resonator, consisting of a hole in a thin <b>plate</b> <b>traversed</b> by a beam. Here, a closed form of the transfer matrix is obtained by coupling the Kirchhoff-Love and the Euler-Bernoulli motion equations.
