5000|$|Documents, {{obtained}} {{by a major}} Japanese newspaper, The Mainichi Daily News, after many official information requests, showed that the Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization (JNES) copied an inspection manual from an original provided by a supplier of fuel-rods: Global Nuclear Fuel Japan Co. This very company was subject to JNES investigations. The faulty manual was copied almost completely, even the layout was not altered, and the errors in it were missed. At first JNES deputy head of inspections Masaharu Kudo told the newspaper: [...] "we do receive data (from Global Nuclear Fuel), but of course we don't use it as-is. The JNES checks the data and produces its own manual as well." [...] After two official requests the newspaper received the originals the JNES manual and the documents of Global Nuclear Fuel document, Kudo did admit that the documents were indeed identical, {{but he could see}} any problem, because JNES and the nuclear fuel firm need <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> about the inspection procedures. [...] "The JNES would have no access to the necessary data without the nuclear fuel maker, so we ask them to cooperate," [...] Kudo continued. [...] "It wouldn't be impossible for the JNES to draw up the manuals independently, but if we tried we'd be at it all day." [...] The inspection procedures were obtained from Global Nuclear Fuel in September 2008, and on 18 December 2009 JNES inspected the fuel that was meant for the Higashidori nuclear plant, the manual used was copied directly from the Global Nuclear Fuel documents. Furthermore, JNES staff noticed later that the minimum fuel rod length already reported to the government was 3 to 5 centimeters longer than the value listed in both the inspection manual and the Global Nuclear Fuel draft procedures. The staff had not looked into the manual, but compared the rod with another rod, before all rods were certified. In February 2009 the error in the manual was found. Just before the certification was reported to the government. Later JNES found that it had made the same mistake three times before with the inspections of fuel-rods produced by Global Nuclear Fuel. The examiners failed to notice the mistakes as they did not closely check the manual beforehand. NISA said JNES was ordered to make the corrections needed and also to improve its screening procedures.|$|E
5000|$|France {{was deeply}} {{split between the}} monarchists on one side, and the Republicans on the other. The Republicans at first seemed highly {{unlikely}} to welcome any military alliance with Russia. That large nation was poor and not industrialized; it was intensely religious and authoritarian, with no sense of democracy or freedom for its peoples. It oppressed Poland, and exiled, and even executed political liberals and radicals. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the Dreyfus affair against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center {{in the world of}} anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews. On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically. France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance. Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its “splendid isolation” mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin. Colonial conflicts in Africa brought Britain and France to a major crisis The Fashoda crisis of 1898 brought Britain and France almost to the brink of war and ended with a humiliation of France that left it hostile to Britain. By 1892 Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation. Russia had been allied with Germany the new Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890 and in 1892 ended the “Reinsurance treaty” with Russia. Russia was now alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany’s strong army and military aggressiveness. The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together. Russia desperately needed money for our infrastructure of railways and ports facilities. The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks eagerly did so. For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway. Rejected by Germany, Russia cautiously began a policy of rapprochement with France starting in 1891 while the French for their part were very interested in the Russian offers of an alliance. In August 1891, France and Russia signed a [...] "consultative pact" [...] where both nations agreed <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> if another power were to threaten the peace of Europe. Negotiations were increasingly successful, and in early 1894 France and Russia signed a military alliance to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them. The alliance was intended to deter Germany from going to war by presenting it with the threat of a two-front war; neither France or Russia could hope to defeat Germany on its own, but their combined power might do so. France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} undertaking, a {{theoretical}} analysis of EC industrial policy. This will involve selecting definitions and identifying policy instruments, and conclude by advancing an industrial policy model {{with which we}} may better comprehend contemporary EC industrial policy. Secondly, it is my aim to explore the relationship which exists between the European Commission and electronics transnational corporations (TNCS) in the creation and control of EC industrial policy. The objective is to understand {{and to provide a}} framework of analysis for the processes of Comrnission-TNC relations. This necessitates understanding how the various organisations interact and how they influence one another. This policy-making power interplay is best conceptualised in terms of the Pentagonal Diplomacy model. I acknowledge that other actors, especially national governments, are important players in EC industrial policy formulation. I argue however, that EC electronics policy is shaped and guided mainly by the Commission and a group of large firms. This process occurs through what Wilks & Wright describe as "informal relationships" [1987 : 2861, the effects of which are often underestimated in analyses of EC industrial policy. Thirdly, I advance the notion that the emergence and consolidation of an EC industrial policy has eroded national sovereignty and contributed to the closer union of Europe 2 ̆ 7 s nation states. The 1990 delineation of an explicit industrial policy for the European Union has implications which go beyond mere rhetoric. Member states are now obliged <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and coordinate their actions in many spheres. This means that the industrial policy competence of the Union should also be understood as part of the integration process. That is, through the Maastricht Treaty, the coordination of economic and monetary policies has become central to the development of European integration. The coordination of industrial policies {{can be seen as a}} flanking dimension of this endeavour. Following on from the 1950 s creation of a High Authority for coal and steel policy, competence has, since the early 19802 ̆ 7 s, shifted from the national to the European level in several other important economic sectors. This power shift signifies a weakening of national government policy autonomy, and a strengthening of supranational bodies, most notably the European Commission. It indicates an integration of decision-making power, as well as an irreversible fusing of national economic interests for core industrial sectors. I shall support these assertions with evidence from the electronics industry...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to 50 years´ anniversary of signing the Rome Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, to better understanding the European Union, {{the relationship of the}} Union and the Member States. The issue of the European Union´s Constitution deadlock including the special issue of the weighting of votes as well as the issue of Poland´s and the Czech Republic´s position on the US offer to install a US led anti-missile system in the two EU Member States : these issues are demonstrating the one crucial identity issue of the relationship of the European Union and its Member States, the relationship of the whole and the parts. Viewing at transdisciplinary comparative reflections on the relationship of the whole and the parts in philosophy, philosophy of economics and in natural science {{as well as in the}} law and policy making system of the European Union: the author concludes that the parts do not constitute the whole as an end in itself, they are subject, however, to a functional dialectical role to achieve common objectives, they are bound by the rationalism´s principle of effectiveness which is one of the constitutional essentials of the Treaty establishing the European Union as the legal incorporation of the functional dialectical approach of combining integrative, cooperative and competitive interactions between the Member States. The author has a deeper look at the biology/cytology system of the cell as a complex network of intracellular and extracellular structures the individual components of which are highly interconnected and practice the dynamics of the dialectical relationship of the cell and its structural components of interconnected cooperative and competitive levels of the complex network: ensuring the vitality of the cell and preventing the cell´s intracellular components from losing their independent identity and getting mixed in the cytoplasm. What prevents the smaller Member States of an enlarged European Union from losing identity, from mixing in the “cytoplasm” of the larger European Union: it is the Union´s complex multileveled network system of the functional approach of the dialectical dynamic cooperative and competitive relationship of the Union and the Member States, the whole and the parts, and that dialectical functional relation prevents the enlarged European Union from being dismantled, as well. Part of that system the Membership of which Poland´s Government had signed is the legal and political commitment to respect Treaty obligations: <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> within the EU´s Council before undertaking bilateral actions having direct impact on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to consult within the EU´s Council a common position before consulting the matter within NATO and,actually, before accepting the US offer to install a anti-missile shield in Central Europe...|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} it entered the fleet, the S-3 {{introduced}} an unprecedented level of systems integration. Previous ASW aircraft like the Lockheed P-3 Orion and S-3's predecessor, the Grumman S-2 Tracker, featured separate instrumentation and controls for each sensor system. Sensor operators often monitored paper traces, using mechanical calipers to make precise measurements and annotating data by writing on the scrolling paper. Beginning with the S-3, all sensor systems were integrated through a single General Purpose Digital Computer (GPDC). Each crew station had its own display, the co-pilot/COTAC, TACCO and SENSO displays were Multi-Purpose Displays (MPD) capable of displaying data from any {{of a number of}} systems. This new level of integration allowed the crew <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by examining the same data at multiple stations simultaneously, to manage workload by assigning responsibility for a given sensor from one station to another, and to easily combine clues from each sensor to classify faint targets.

40|$|This thesis makes a {{contribution}} to network theory and how it applies to economics. It consists of three self-contained papers. It predominantly considers how connections between economic entities can affect economic outcomes. In particular, the first two papers examine social learning, in the one case by applying it to portfolio choice, {{and in the other}} by conducting an experiment to determine how people incorporate information from others into their beliefs to achieve economic outcomes. The final paper looks at how sectoral shocks can be transmitted through the economy through the connections between industries. The first paper, Social learning and financial markets: Can informed neighbors make up for a lack of financial acumen?, allows financially- informed and uninformed agents <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> on different social networks and examines what the benefits are to the two different groups of agents on the different networks in terms of financial investment. The second paper, Incorporating information into beliefs on networks: An experiment, studies how agents incorporate into their beliefs information they receive from other agents. In particular, it considers whether agents use the DeGroot model or a Bayesian approach. Further, it considers how the density of network connections affects the results of consultation. The third paper, Sectoral shocks and aggregate volatility, explores how sectoral shocks can propagate through the economy through the input-output networks. It devises a demand-side measure of industry influence and shows that such a demand-side measure is needed to fully understand the influence of industries with a case study of the Australian mining industry...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{organizations}} of the Caribbean countries continue to face serious challenges {{posed by the}} increased demand for more relevant, accurate and timely statistical data. Tangible {{progress has been made}} in delivering key products in the area of economic statistics. The central banks of the subregion have assisted greatly in this respect. However, even in this branch of statistics there are still several glaring gaps. The situation is even worse in other areas of statistics including social and environmental statistics. Even though all countries of the subregion have committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as to other internationally agreed development goals serious challenges remain with respect to the compilation of the agreed indicators to assist in assessing progress towards the goals. It is acknowledged that appreciable assistance has been provided by the various donor agencies to develop statistical competence. This assistance has translated into the many gains that have been made. However, the national statistical organizations require much more help if they are to reach the plateau of self reliance in the production of the necessary statistical services. The governments of the subregion have also committed to invest more in statistical development and in promoting a statistics culture in the Caribbean. The training institutions of the subregion have also started to address this urgent need by broadening and deepening their teaching curricula. Funding support is urgently required to develop the appropriate cadre of statistical professionals to deliver the required outputs. However, this training must be continuous and must be sustained over an appropriate period since the current turnover of trained staff is high. This programme of training will need to be intensive for a period of at least five years after which it may be reduced. The modalities of training will also have to be more focused and in addition to formal training at educational institutions there is much room for on-the-job training, group training at the national level and much more south-south capacity building. There is also an urgent need to strengthen cooperation and collaboration among the donor community in the delivery of assistance for statistical development. Several development agencies with very good intentions are currently operating in the Caribbean. There is a danger however, that efforts can be duplicated if agencies do not collaborate adequately. Development agencies therefore need <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> much more and share there development agenda more freely if duplication is to be averted.
