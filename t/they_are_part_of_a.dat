5|$|The Simpson and Suwannee points, {{found in}} Florida and the Southeastern United States, {{are similar to}} the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series. Identification is made by {{examination}} of the blade edges—Golondrina exhibits much less serration. The Meserve type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations.

The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.|$|E
5|$|Argo is a 2012 {{political}} thriller {{directed by}} Ben Affleck, and produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck and George Clooney. The screenplay by Chris Terrio {{was adapted from}} sections of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Tony Mendez's memoir The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA, and the 2007 Wired article The Great Escape by Joshuah Bearman on the Canadian Caper. The film stars Affleck as Mendez, who attempts to rescue six United States diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis by pretending that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> film crew scouting {{the country for the}} filming of a fictitious science-fiction film, Argo.

5|$|Section 9 {{operatives}} {{develop a}} theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or 傀儡廻 (Kugutsumawashi, literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い Ningyō-zukai, literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes {{the disappearance of the}} sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lipid, are {{a diverse group}} of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure {{is one of the most}} fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E

25|$|Poirot sends his valet out {{investigating}} {{and finds}} an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions {{of where it}} would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E
