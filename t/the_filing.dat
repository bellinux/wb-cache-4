5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to the parent company violated the beverage contracts between various parties. Negotiations between the two entities eventually failed, {{which led to a}} class action suit being filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Burger King Corporation, Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper on behalf of all Burger King franchises in the United States in May 2009. In <b>the</b> <b>filing,</b> the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Congress {{passed the}} Mining in the Parks Act, which closed Death Valley National Monument to <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> of new mining claims, banned open-pit mining and {{required}} the National Park Service {{to examine the}} validity {{of tens of thousands}} of pre-1976 mining claims. Mining was allowed to resume on a limited basis in 1980 with stricter environmental standards.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Pizza Time Theatre went public; {{however, the}} {{evolving}} video game {{industry and the}} video game crash of 1983 resulted in significant losses for Pizza Time Theatre, which lost $15 million in 1983, and by 1984, Bushnell’s debts were insurmountable, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for Pizza Time Theatre Inc.

An additional class-action suit was filed by stockholders claiming Plains provided “false and misleading statements” regarding pipeline maintenance and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. <b>The</b> <b>filing</b> came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to {{a claim for}} an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> fees and lied to Wyatt about what {{happened}} to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and did not pass on the royalties to her.|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{computer}} world, {{the information is}} maintained in a file. Some interrupts may occur on the stored data to corrupt <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> This may be termed as ‘Attacks’. There exists lot of attacks that would corrupt our <b>file.</b> One of <b>the</b> common attacks is termed as DDOS Attack. To avoid these attacks and to prevent our <b>files,</b> <b>the</b> concept of <b>file</b> watcher, Ip watcher and firewall are used. All our files are saved in the database and the firewall allows all kinds of users to access <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> This kind of permission to access <b>the</b> <b>file</b> has certain limitations such as until the user does not involve in the action of modifying <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>file</b> gets modified by an individual, it gets corrupted. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>file</b> from these attacks, <b>the</b> <b>file</b> watcher and Ip watcher are included. File watcher is responsible to monitor <b>the</b> <b>file</b> stored in <b>the</b> home directory and analyze the modifications made in <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> IP address that modifies <b>the</b> <b>file</b> can be detected by IP watcher. When the client sends request to modify <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> watcher deny <b>the</b> service provided to the user and thus prevent <b>the</b> <b>file</b> from attack. <b>The</b> IP Address of the client who sends attack on <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is blocked by adding its address to the blocked list of the firewall. The clients whose IP Address are in the blocked list can’t have permission to access <b>the</b> <b>file</b> further. Thus <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is prevented from the attacks. In this paper, a new method has been proposed to watch the activities taken in <b>the</b> <b>file</b> and to prevent <b>the</b> <b>file</b> from modifications by other users...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} week of January 2014, a filing with the U.S. District court in San Jose showed that legal {{executives}} from both parties agreed to meet prior to February 19, 2014, to engage in settlement discussions. Both Samsung and Apple were responding to a court order that instructed the completion of such a meeting before a new trial begins in March 2014. One of three Samsung chiefs met with Cook, but <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> did not reveal the name of the representative.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> deadline, Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's cross-filing system. Voorhis also filed in the two major party primaries. Under cross-filing, if the same candidate won both major party endorsements, he would be effectively elected, with only minor party candidates to stand against him. Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E
5|$|The new {{district}} map was not {{agreed upon}} by the General Assembly until March 26, 1992, one week before <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5. Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27, and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2. Miller's hometown of Lancaster was placed in freshman David Hobson's Springfield-based Seventh District, but Miller chose {{to run in the}} Sixth District against McEwen since the largest piece of his old district — five counties — was placed in the new Sixth. Miller's decision was also impacted by his strong personal distaste for McEwen.|$|E

5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In <b>the</b> <b>filing,</b> Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case. After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition {{on the first day}} of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at oral arguments, held on January 19, 2016.|$|E
50|$|EFS {{works by}} {{encrypting}} a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as <b>the</b> <b>File</b> Encryption Key, or FEK), {{which is used}} because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher were used. The symmetric key used to encrypt <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is then encrypted with a public key associated with the user who encrypted <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> and this encrypted data is stored in the header of <b>the</b> encrypted <b>file.</b> To decrypt <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system uses <b>the</b> private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in <b>the</b> <b>file</b> header.

Allegheny County Councilman Bill Robinson stated that he would run for Mayor despite not meeting the deadline for petitions {{to appear on the}} ballot. Jim Ferlo, despite filing to run, dropped out of the race three days later, on March 15. On March 27, Darlene Harris dropped out of the race. On the same day, Jack Wagner received endorsements from Pittsburgh police and firefighter unions, as well as former candidate and State Senator Jim Ferlo. Also on March 27, Bill Peduto was endorsed by State Representative Ed Gainey.|$|E
5|$|Upon <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> of the application, the Court {{may either}} make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} {{be issued to}} enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E
5|$|With its {{connection}} through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi {{to the south}} and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting nativist sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to free states caused it to become a center for <b>the</b> <b>filing</b> of freedom suits. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the Dred Scott case, interpretations had changed and the US Supreme Court ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the American Civil War. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under Union control.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{a program}} tries to access a <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> {{operating}} system {{needs to know}} two things: which <b>file</b> <b>the</b> program is asking for, and whether the program has permission to access <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> In <b>the</b> example, <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is designated by its name, “BILL”. The server receives <b>the</b> <b>file</b> name from <b>the</b> client, but does not know whether the client had permission to write <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> When <b>the</b> server opens <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> system uses the server’s permission, not the client’s. When <b>the</b> <b>file</b> name was passed from the client to the server, the permission did not go along with it; the permission was increased by the system silently and automatically.|$|R
