5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E
25|$|The rise {{of field}} guides for the {{identification}} of birds was another major innovation. The early guides {{such as those of}} Thomas Bewick (2 volumes) and William Yarrell (3 volumes) were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of field guides was prepared by Florence Merriam, sister of Clinton Hart Merriam, the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series Hints to Audubon Workers:Fifty Birds and How <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Them</b> in Grinnell's Audubon Magazine. These were followed by new field guides including classics by Roger Tory Peterson.|$|E

The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians. But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.|$|E

Around 1964, LaBelle was engaged to Otis Williams, founding member of The Temptations, but broke it off due to scheduling conflicts. In 1969, LaBelle married a longtime friend, Armstead Edwards. After LaBelle started a solo career, Edwards became her manager until the couple separated in the late 1990s. In 2000, the couple announced they had legally separated. Three years later, their divorce was finalized. They have a son, Zuri Kye Edwards (born 1973), who is now her current manager. In addition to Zuri, LaBelle has two people in her life who are like sons to her, Dodd and Stanley. LaBelle came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> {{after the death of}} their mother, Veaunita, a neighborhood acquaintance.|$|E

According to Zeitz, [...] "the greater Lincoln grew in death, the greater they grew for having known him so well, and so intimately, in life. Everyone wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> {{if only to}} ask {{what it had been}} like—what he had been like."

Zeitz concurs, [...] "Americans today understand Abraham Lincoln much as Nicolay and Hay hoped that they would." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} discussed changing Kono to {{a female}} character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them.</b> Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, {{as well as some}} comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, [...] "Book 'em, Danno". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Francois {{suggested}} newly famous stage actress Michele Alfa for {{the role}} of Christine, and Renoir went with his wife Marguerite and Zwobada to see her perform in a play. While at the play Renoir noticed Nora Gregor in a box seat in the audience and asked about her during the intermission. He learned that Gregor was the wife of Prince Ernst Rudiger von Stahremberg, an Austrian nobleman. Renoir became friends with Gregor and her husband, getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> over several dinners in Paris. Stahremberg was forced to resign his leadership role in the Heimwehra paramilitary fascist partybecause Gregor was Jewish and he was anti-fascist. When Germany annexed Austria in March 1938 Gregor and Stahremberg fled to France. Renoir said they were [...] "in a state of great disarray. Everything they believed in was collapsing." [...] Gregor was an actress from the Viennese Burgtheater and had appeared in some films, including Carl Theodor Dreyer's Michael. Gregor's first husband had been the concert pianist Mitja Nikisch, son of the renowned conductor Arthur Nikisch of the Leipzig Opera and according to film theorist Charles Drazin, a possible inspiration for some characteristics of Octave.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode two stars out of four. She praised Carter's directing, but {{felt that the}} story {{suffered}} {{in comparison to the}} second season's [...] "Duane Barry", also written and directed by Carter, which was better at [...] "unsettling ambiguity". She felt that there were too many characters for the audience to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them,</b> and the lack of resolution would leave the audience [...] "utterly frustrated". Other reviews were more critical. Author Phil Farrand wrote negatively of the episode, calling it his third least favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two positively critiqued Carter's directing, calling the entry [...] "good looking" [...] and noting that it was [...] "a decidedly grisly hour of television." [...] However, they derided the plot and called it [...] "barely cooked", writing that the characters that are killed are wholly one-dimensional and are not fleshed out.|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>them,</b> but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E

Though it was labelled a romance, she expressed discontent with the stereotype. Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew. Cookson had little connection with the London literary circus. She was always more interested in practising the art of writing. Her research could be uncomfortable—going down a mine, for instance, because her heroine came from a mining area.
