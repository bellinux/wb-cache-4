[...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties <b>translucidus</b> (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E

50|$|Stratocumulus <b>Translucidus</b> {{consist of}} {{separate}} groups of stratocumulus clouds, {{with a clear}} sky (or higher clouds) visible between them. No precipitation in most cases.|$|E
50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus {{stratiformis}} {{has three}} opacity-based varieties; <b>Translucidus</b> (CM3), perlucidus (CM3 or 7 depending on predominant opacity), and opacus (CM7). Varieties based on opacity are not commonly associatied with the species lenticularis, castellanus, or floccus.|$|E
50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus <b>translucidus</b> is {{relatively}} thin {{so that the}} sun or moon is always visible as if seen through frosted glass. It is strictly a middle cloud and is coded CM1 in the SYNOP report. The opacus variety is sufficiently thick to obscure the sun or moon and can extend vertically into the high étage. It is therefore sometimes classified as vertical or multi-level, but is still coded CM2 as a middle cloud.|$|E
50|$|Stratus fractus are not {{divided into}} varieties, but stratus {{nebulosus}} {{on the other}} hand, are divided into two. The Stratus opacus variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the nebulosus species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus <b>Translucidus</b> is another variety of the nebulosus species. These clouds are considered more thin than the opacus variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing {{the position of the}} sun or moon to be observed from earth's surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Labarrus <b>translucidus</b> and Pseudesymus lucidus are {{recorded}} as new for the fauna of Dagestan, the Caucasus and Russia. Earlier these species {{were found in}} Central Asia. Labarrus <b>translucidus</b> and Pseudesymus lucidus {{are recorded}} for Island Chechen only. Labarrus lividus is similiar to Labarrus <b>translucidus</b> and it was recorded for other part of Dagestan. Species are reliably divided by a structure of genitals only. Photos of habitus and epipharinx of Labarrus <b>translucidus</b> and Pseudesymus lucidus, drawings of genitals of Labarrus <b>translucidus</b> and Labarrus lividus are given in the paper...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{describe}} for {{the first}} time the adult female of the troglobitic scorpion Troglorhopalurus <b>translucidus</b> Lourenço Baptista & Giupponi, 2004, and broaden its known distribution to other sandstone caves at Chapada Diamantina's region. The life history of T. <b>translucidus</b> is reconstructed through morphometric measurements, with a multivariate analysis applied on a set of 16 specimens in all stages (including the holotype) and biological notes. The ontogeny of T. <b>translucidus</b> has seven stages and the litter size is 43 (n = 1). We discuss the isolation of T. <b>translucidus</b> and Rhopalurus lacrau Lourenço & Pinto-da-Rocha, 1997 in caves of Chapada Diamantina, and discuss their troglomorphisms (autapomorphies) among other species related with Rhopalurus. Both species must be considered fragile due their restricted endemism at Chapada Diamantina...|$|E

40|$|Three {{new species}} of Entoloma s. l. from Kerala State, India are described, {{illustrated}} and discussed. Entoloma haematinum, a very small, bright red, omphalinoid species, reminiscent of Hygrocybe cantharellus, is unique because ofits quadrate-cuboidspores; it fits well in subgenus Omphaliopsis. Entoloma nubilum and E. carneum are both characterised by their small, pleurotoid basidiocarps. The first {{is related to the}} species ofsubgenus Leptonia; the second fits better in subgenus Claudopus. Comments are given on the taxonomic position of the new species.
