5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as <b>the</b> <b>Protective</b> Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. <b>The</b> <b>protective</b> symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{design of}} {{structural}} members is considered less collision effects, {{so it may}} be possible to cause damage due to impact loads. In view of this, impact-resistant performance of <b>the</b> composite <b>protective</b> measures proposed in the early time was analyzed. In the process of the numerical simulation, the observed reinforced concrete beams fixed at both ends with four different measures including the unprotected, <b>the</b> rigid <b>protective,</b> <b>the</b> flexible <b>protective</b> and <b>the</b> composite <b>protective</b> one were considered separately. <b>Protective</b> effects of <b>the</b> different measures were compared and analyzed by observing the strain, the velocity, the acceleration and the impact force of the target beam. Numerical results show that <b>the</b> composite <b>protective</b> system works best. <b>The</b> composite <b>protective</b> layer of <b>the</b> beam can suppress the impact response effectively...|$|R

5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> lacquer {{covering}} Knife Edge Two Piece degraded {{and exposed}} the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. <b>The</b> <b>protective</b> attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>protective</b> anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
