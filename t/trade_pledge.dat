40|$|In the 2004 U. S. elections, {{the dispute}} on trade policy {{was one of}} the {{important}} issues between the Democrats and the Republicans. The Democratic Party emphasized that the U. S. government should link multinational trade agreements to labor and environmental issues. Conversely, the Republican Party advocated free <b>trade</b> and <b>pledged</b> to make the expansion of trade a consistent priority. This dis-pute over trade policy raises an interesting question: Does a party’s tariff platform affect its electoral outcome? It is recognized that, in the late 20 th century, the Democratic Party was labeled as a pro-moter of protectionism (Magee, Brock, and Young 1989). Simultaneously, the Democrats lost their longtime majority in the House of Representative with the election of the 104 th Congress in 1994. Hence, it is natural to ask: Did the high Democratic tariff plat-form translate into its falling vote share? Previous studies have recognized that campaign contributions and lobbies affect trade policy. The related theoretical models on the political economy of trade policy have two different approaches. The first one is the median-voter approach, developed by Mayer (1984) ...|$|R

50|$|Foreign labels {{accounted}} for just 18 {{percent of the}} NT$45 billion (US$1.3 billion) beer market in the ROC in 2004; Taiwan Beer {{accounted for}} all of the remaining 82 percent. Two years later the PRC refused to allow Taiwan Beer to be imported. Officials cited a law banning the use of county or regional names in commercial products. In the ROC this argument was hardly persuasive, given the number of products in China already sporting such names, including PRC's Tsingtao Beer, named for a city in Shandong province. The move was interpreted by many Taiwanese as an attempt to thwart the free <b>trade</b> PRC had <b>pledged</b> by denying Taiwan proper recognition of its trademarks. A boycott of beers from China was soon under way on the island. The controversy, widely reported in the international press, led to increased recognition of the Taiwan Beer brand.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the locus}} of trade appears to have shifted from the {{multilateral}} stage to the bilateral and plurilateral levels. This article focuses on the integration {{of human rights in}} bilateral and plurilateral free trade agreements as a complementary strategy to achieving a coherent international law. It draws on Switzerland as a case study, in reference to its bilateral trade relations and as part of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The study puts forward a mix of arguments supporting the integration of human rights in Swiss free trade agreements: international law impetuses stemming from the need to preserve a coherent international legal system and uphold the human rights obligations of all <b>trade</b> partners, Switzerland's <b>pledge</b> to ensure coherence of its policies, and economic arguments purporting to strengthen economic integration and to reduce the costs for business.

After Mossendjo suffered structural damage due to strong winds on 23 January 2006, Nguélé held a fundraiser in Brazzaville to collect money to repair the damage. Tele Mossendjo, a television station for Mossendjo, was created at Nguélé's initiative and launched on 29 April 2007. Nguélé said on that occasion that the station would end the town's isolation by providing its people with direct access to information concerning events {{in the rest of}} the country and the world, particularly emphasizing that it would enable the people to follow the work of the government and President Sassou Nguesso. On the same date, he inaugurated a local bridge across the Itibou River; the completion of the bridge, which was needed to facilitate local <b>trade,</b> fulfilled a <b>pledge</b> made by Nguélé some years before.|$|R
5000|$|The twelve Federal Reserve banks {{provide the}} {{financial}} means {{to operate the}} Federal Reserve System. Each reserve bank is organized much like a private corporation {{so that it can}} provide the necessary revenue to cover operational expenses and implement the demands of the board. A member bank is a privately owned bank that must buy an amount equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus of stock in the Reserve Bank within its region of the Federal Reserve System. This stock [...] "may not be sold, <b>traded,</b> or <b>pledged</b> as security for a loan" [...] and all member banks receive a 6% annual dividend. No stock in any Federal Reserve Bank has ever been sold to the public, to foreigners, or to any non-bank U.S. firm. These member banks must maintain fractional reserves either as vault currency or on account at its Reserve Bank. As of October 2008, the Federal Reserve has paid interest to banks' holdings in Reserve Banks' accounts. The dividends paid by the Federal Reserve Banks to member banks are considered partial compensation for the lack of interest paid on the required reserves. All profit after expenses is returned to the U.S. Treasury or contributed to the surplus capital of the Federal Reserve Banks. Since shares in ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks are redeemable only at par, the nominal [...] "owners" [...] do not benefit from this surplus capital. In 2010, the Federal Reserve System contributed $79 billion to the U.S. Treasury.|$|R
30|$|In practice, {{small banks}} lack methods and {{techniques}} to dynamically hedge such loans. Big investment banks could consider creating such derivatives and directly selling them to small financial institutions; this would provide new market space. In addition, the scientific {{measurement of the}} pledged loan-to-value ratio means that using simple rules of thumb or the VaR method may lead to mispricing, which could create the possibility of arbitrage. This provides a direction for trading derivative products of pledges. In this paper, the result is concluded in the situation of fixed interest rates. For floating interest rate circumstances, we should introduce a random interest rate process and specify the function form between the loan interest and the risk-free rate. The major limitation of this method is that the matter should be tradable. The option pricing method requires that sales of the underlying assets can be transacted dynamically with a low cost. If futures corresponding to the pledged properties exist, for example, metal futures, a dynamic hedge can be achieved through futures <b>trading.</b> For a <b>pledged</b> property with corresponding futures that are non-tradable or require expensive transactions, we should introduce risk appetite or use the traditional method to analyze.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{used the}} option pricing method to {{systematically}} analyze the pricing of an inventory pledge loan and emphasized the pledged loan-to-value ratio. Compared with existing domestic research, the method of this paper has rich theoretical implications. First, each different loan term has its own pledged loan-to-value ratio, thus this method allows us to determine the term structure of the pledged loan-to-value ratio. Second, the method {{can be used to}} analyze the relationship between the pledged loan-to-value ratio and the loan interest rate. Third, volatility influences the pledged loan-to-value ratio, and therefore, this method can be used to analyze {{the manner in which the}} pledged loan-to-value ratio varies with different types of metals pledged. Lastly, risk attitude affects the determination of the pledged loan-to-value ratio. The major limitation of this method is that the matter pledged should be tradable. The option pricing method requires that the sales of the underlying assets can be transacted dynamically with a low cost. If the pledged property exists, a dynamic hedge of its corresponding futures product (for example, metal futures) can be achieved by futures <b>trading.</b> For a <b>pledged</b> property with futures that are non-tradable or require expensive transactions, we should introduce risk appetite or use the traditional method for analysis. The main purpose of this paper is to articulate the theoretical framework and analytical method; the concrete conclusion and empirical implications will be offered in follow-up studies. Compared to the previous version, this paper summarizes and analyzes more related literature in recent years.|$|R
5000|$|Clinton did win Upstate New York's {{traditionally}} Democratic {{cities and}} hold onto urban counties upstate. However Trump nevertheless also made gains in urban parts of upstate, which {{had long been}} in economic decline, due to his strength in economically distressed areas and his appeal to working class whites who traditionally vote Democratic. Trump's message on <b>trade</b> policy and <b>pledge</b> to halt job outsourcing appealed strongly to the Rust Belt region of the United States, where many local economies had been ravaged by loss of industrial jobs, which extends into Upstate New York cities like Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. In Erie County, where Buffalo is located in Western New York bordering the Great Lakes, Clinton won only 51-44 compared with Obama's 57-41 victory in 2012. Clinton suffered her strongest swings against her in traditionally Democratic Northern New York along the Saint Lawrence River, becoming the first Democrat to lose Franklin County and St. Lawrence County since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Trump won St. Lawrence County 51-42, where Obama had won 57-41, and Franklin County 48-43, where Obama had won 62-36. Clinton barely held onto neighboring Clinton County 47-45, which Obama had also won 62-36. [...] The only upstate county where Clinton won by a stronger margin than Obama had in 2012 was the liberal Democratic stronghold of Tompkins County, home to the college town of Ithaca where Cornell University is located. Clinton and Obama both received 68% in the county, but Trump's unpopularity with young people and students led him to fall to only 24% of the vote compared with 28% for Romney.|$|R
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' <b>trade</b> deficit and <b>pledged</b> to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|R
