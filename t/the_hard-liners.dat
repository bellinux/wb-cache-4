25|$|In 1968, the New Economic Mechanism was introduced, {{intending}} on revitalizing the Hungarian economy, {{while the}} band Illés won almost every prize {{at the prestigious}} Táncdalfesztivál. In the 1970s, however, <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> of the Communist party cracked down on dissidence in Hungary, and rock was a major target. The band Illés was banned from performing and recording, while Metró and Omega left. Some {{of the members of}} these bands formed a supergroup, Locomotiv GT, that quickly became very famous. The remaining members of Omega, meanwhile, succeeded in achieving stardom in Germany, and remained very popular for a time.|$|E
25|$|By 1796 Hoche had a {{free hand}} because, unlike earlier governments, the French Directory {{did not need to}} approve every operation. With unity of command and near-dictatorial powers, his expeditions {{continuously}} pressed the insurgents. An earlier truce worked in his favor by allowing the rebels to briefly enjoy peace; afterward they were less inclined to fight. Elsewhere, French victories over the First Coalition armies made Royalist prospects look dim. At length, rebel leaders Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and François de Charette were captured and executed. By March 1796 the south bank of the Loire River was pacified and Hoche deployed 15,000 infantry and two cavalry regiments against the Chouans on the north bank. By May the Chouannerie was quelled after most of the leaders were captured or gave up. In return for peace, Hoche promised that the priests had religious freedom while the young men would not be conscripted into the army. About 2,000 Republican deserters fighting for the rebels surrendered and their only punishment was to return to the Republican army. <b>The</b> <b>hard-liners</b> were not pleased with Hoche's lenient terms and wished that Willot had been in charge. However, the Directory was so thankful for Hoche's efforts that it publicly proclaimed him Pacificateur and bought him a pair of pistols, two good horses and riding tack.|$|E
500|$|In later days, Bahrain was {{engulfed in}} the Khawalid brothers-led-crackdown with almost daily clashes between {{security}} forces and opposition activists. The crackdown was the widest against the opposition in Bahrain's modern history; dozens of protesters were killed, some due to torture in police custody. Thousands of Shia were expelled from their jobs and dozens of their mosques were demolished. Al-Mushīr also ppresided over the Court of National Safety, a military court that convicted more than 500 defendants, including all opposition leaders outside Al Wefaq (i.e. Bahrain Thirteen). [...] "The different style of the crackdown reflected a different leadership calling the shots," [...] said Kinninmont. The Independent reported that continued crackdown and the Saudi-led intervention has increased the influence of al-Mushīr, which it named [...] "the leading hardliner within the royal family". Professor Michael Hudson said that the [...] "crackdown mark the victory of <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> within the royal establishment".|$|E
5000|$|According to Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a [...] "leading Iranian {{newspaper}} editor and confidant of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami" [...] interviewed by Newsweek magazine, the arrest and stiff sentence were {{an attempt to}} distract attention from two bills to increase the power of president and curb <b>the</b> <b>hard-liner</b> conservatives' supervisory power which reformist President Khatami had introduced into Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|The group members, on {{the other}} hand, point out that {{less than a week}} after the poetic {{demonstration}} in the Akerstein factory in Yeruham, <b>the</b> <b>hard-liner</b> local executive was fired and some of the workers' demands were accepted. Similarly, following the demonstration in the coffee-shop in Tel Aviv, the waitresses' demands were fully granted. Each and every event gained valuable publicity for the corresponding campaign. Moreover, as one of the striking Akerstein's employees put it: [...] "Tarbut's visit is empowering us in our struggle, it raises our spirits." ...|$|R
50|$|Leaflets air-dropped to the Japanese people {{informed}} {{them of the}} Potsdam Declaration, which brought to bear the extent of Allied victory, and of the Japanese government's peace negotiations, undermining the ability of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>hard-liners</b> to insist on continued war.|$|R
2500|$|Believing {{they had}} {{the upper hand in}} the conflict, {{beginning}} in 1980 the Islamists began a series of campaigns against government installations in Aleppo; the attacks became urban guerilla warfare. The government began to lose control in the city and, inspired by events, similar disturbances spread to Hama, Homs, Idlib, Latakia, Deir ez-Zor, Maaret-en-Namen and Jisr esh-Shagour. Those affected by Ba'athist repression began to rally behind the insurgents; Ba'ath Party co-founder Bitar supported the uprising, rallying the old, anti-military Ba'athists. The increasing threat to the government's survival strengthened <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners,</b> who favored repression over concessions. Security forces began to purge all state, party and social institutions in Syria, and were sent to the northern provinces to quell the uprising. When this failed, <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> began accusing the United States of fomenting the uprising and called for the reinstatement of [...] "revolutionary vigilance". <b>The</b> <b>hard-liners</b> won the debate after a failed attempt on Assad's life in June 1980, and began responding to the uprising with state terrorism later that year. Under Rifaat al-Assad Islamic prisoners at the Tadmur prison were massacred, membership in the Muslim Brotherhood became a capital offence and the government sent a death squad to kill Bitar and Attar's former wife. The military court began condemning captured militants, which [...] "sometimes degenerated into indiscriminate killings". Little care was taken to distinguish Muslim Brotherhood hard-liners from their passive supporters, and violence was met with violence.|$|E
5000|$|The armed forces' {{officer corps}} was divided {{between those who}} {{believed}} that they should confine themselves to their barracks, and <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> who regarded politicians as willing to turn Brazil to communism. The victory of <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> dragged Brazil into what political scientist Juan J. Linz called [...] "an authoritarian situation." [...] However, because <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> could not ignore the counterweight opinions of their colleagues or the resistance of society, {{they were unable to}} institutionalize their agenda politically. In addition, they did not attempt to eliminate liberal constitutionalism because they feared disapproval of international opinion and damage to their alignment with the United States. the United States as bastion of anticommunism during the Cold War, provided the ideology that the authoritarians used to justify their hold on power. Washington also preached liberal democracy, which forced the authoritarians to assume the contradictory position of defending democracy, while destroying it. Their concern for appearances caused them to abstain from personal dictatorship by requiring each successive general-president to hand over power to his replacement.|$|E
50|$|In 1977 and 1978 the Presidential {{succession}} issue caused further political {{confrontation with}} <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners.</b> In October 1977 he suddenly dismissed the far-right Minister of Army, General Sylvio Couto Coelho da Frota {{who had tried}} to become candidate for the next President.|$|E
2500|$|The modernisers {{called for}} {{community}} campaigns among the white working-class populations of London's East End, and Northern England. While the modernisers gained some concessions from <b>the</b> party's <b>hard-liners,</b> Tyndall opposed {{many of their}} ideas and sought to stem their growing influence. In his view, [...] "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves {{in order to make}} our features more appealing to the public".|$|R
50|$|He later backs {{off from}} this pledge due to {{pressure}} from <b>hard-liners.</b> <b>The</b> mujaheddin say his association with Najibullah makes him unacceptable for any compromise. On July 16, 2004, he died in Netherlands {{at the age of}} 70.|$|R
50|$|In August 1991, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev by ex-communist military <b>hard-liners.</b> <b>The</b> coup failed, and all members of it were arrested; {{from the ashes of}} the old Soviet Union, the modern Russian Federation was born.|$|R
5000|$|The {{influences}} of socialism and socialist movements in Pakistan have taken many different forms as a counterpart to political conservatism, from <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> of the Communist Party {{through to the}} reformist electoral project enshrined in {{the birth of the}} Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1972, François Duprat co-founded the National Front (FN) {{headed by}} Jean-Marie Le Pen, and {{was part of}} its {{political}} bureau {{until his death in}} 1978. He represented <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> of the party, and directed the Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires (National Revolutionary Groups), alongside Alain Renault.|$|E
50|$|Being {{the head}} of the Presidential Security Service, Korzhakov was {{frequently}} accused of interfering in governmental affairs, as the Service gathered evidence on high government officials engaged in corruption, bribe-taking, and squandering money. He was regarded as one of <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> of Yeltsin's team, a strong backer of the war in Chechnya, and an opponent to holding the presidential election in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Khrushchev also {{promoted}} and groomed Leonid Brezhnev, whom {{he brought}} to Kremlin and introduced to Stalin in 1952. Then Khrushchev promoted Brezhnev to Presidium (Politburo) and made him the Head of Political Directorate of the Red Army and Navy, and moved him up to several other powerful positions. Brezhnev in return helped Khrushchev by tipping {{the balance of power}} during several critical confrontations with <b>the</b> conservative <b>hard-liners,</b> including <b>the</b> ouster of pro-Stalinists headed by Molotov and Malenkov.|$|R
40|$|Throughout 2001, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, {{punctuated by}} {{gestures}} {{of peace and}} acts of violence, continued in its cycle of promise and disappointment. It was a year {{of changes in the}} Israeli and American administrations, as well as a call for a change in the Palestinian administration. It was a year which saw American involvement wax and wane and wax again. Although to no avail, U. S. President Bill Clinton strove to facilitate a lasting peace in the closing days of his presidency. Incoming President George W. Bush, stepping back in the initial months of his presidency from such intense American involvement in the region, retracted Clinton’s final peace plan. Soon, however, Bush realized the need to send a special envoy, General Anthony Zinni to the region in an attempt to support the diplomatic work of C. I. A. Director George Tenet to implement the Mitchell recommendations for peace. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s peace efforts, he was defeated in the February Israeli elections. He lost to <b>the</b> <b>hard-liner</b> Ariel Sharon, whose march across the contested Temple Mount in Jerusalem in September of 2000, sparked the round of violence that continues until today.

50|$|During that time, the {{regional}} {{delegate to the}} Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was the Soviet marshal Sergei Akhromeyev — one of <b>the</b> most pre-eminent <b>hard-liners</b> in <b>the</b> Soviet power system, {{and one of the}} close allies of the putchists that attempted to overthrow Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Another issue {{concerned}} the youth league. The party took an initiative {{to create a}} broad-based youth movement, looking at similar developments in countries like Finland. In 1952, Democratic Youth (Demokratisk Ungdom) was founded as a broad youth movement, parallel to the existing Young Communist League of Sweden. <b>The</b> <b>hard-liners</b> saw this as diluting the political character of the youth movement.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hard-liners</b> {{reacted to}} the opening {{with a series of}} {{terrorist}} bombings. An April 1981 bombing incident confirmed direct military involvement in terrorism, but Figueiredo proved too weak to punish the guilty. The incident and the regime's inaction strengthened the public's resolve to end military rule. Moreover, Figueiredo faced other significant problems, such as soaring inflation, declining productivity, and a mounting foreign debt.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 President Emílio Garrastazu Médici {{selected}} Geisel to be {{his successor}} as the President. There had been intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering by <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> against him and by the more moderate supporters of Castelo Branco for him. Fortunately for Geisel, his older brother, Orlando Geisel was the Minister of Army, and his close ally General João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo the chief of Médici's military staff.|$|E
50|$|By 1990 the Muslim Board's chief {{official}} in Dushanbe, the senior qadi, Hajji Akbar Turajonzoda (in office 1988-92), {{had become an}} independent public figure with a broad following. In the factional political battle that followed independence, Turajonzoda criticized <b>the</b> communist <b>hard-liners</b> and supported political reform and official recognition {{of the importance of}} Islam in Tajikistani society. At the same time, he repeatedly denied hard-liners' accusations that he sought the establishment of an Islamic government in Tajikistan. After the hard-liners' victory in the civil war at the end of 1992, Turajonzoda fled Dushanbe and was charged with treason.|$|R
50|$|In the 2005 book Firmaets største bedrift {{historian}} Peer Henrik Hansen {{argues that}} Aksel Larsen was {{recruited by the}} U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to Hansen Larsen had his first meetings with American agents in November 1958 in his own home. According to the newspaper Information Larsen was offered information on sentiments among <b>the</b> party <b>hard-liners</b> if he would cause a split in the party. For years the CIA had a bugging device in the apartment of Alfred Jensen the vice-chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark. From there they knew about the tensions in the party leadership.|$|R
5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate <b>the</b> military <b>hard-liners</b> in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|R
50|$|There {{had been}} intense behind-the-scenes {{maneuvering}} by <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> {{against him and}} by the more moderate supporters of Castelo Branco for him. Fortunately for Geisel, his older brother, Orlando Geisel was the Minister of Army, and his close ally, General João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo, was chief of Médici's military staff. Once in power, Geisel adopted a more moderate stance with regards to political opposition than his predecessor Médici.|$|E
50|$|In {{the realm}} of more {{practical}} politics, Izvolsky advocated a gradual rapprochement with Russia's traditional foes - Great Britain and Japan. He had to face vigorous opposition from several directions, notably from the public opinion and <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> in the military, who demanded a revanchist war against Japan and military advance into Afghanistan. His allies in the government included Pyotr Stolypin and Vladimir Kokovtsov. He concluded the Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1907 to improve relations with Japan.|$|E
50|$|Many historians compare Khrushchev's Thaw and {{his massive}} efforts {{to change the}} Soviet society and move away from its past, with Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost during the 1980s. Although they led the Soviet Union in {{different}} eras, both Khrushchev and Gorbachev had initiated dramatic reforms. Both efforts lasted {{only a few years}} and were supported by the people, while being opposed by <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners.</b> Both leaders were dismissed, albeit with completely different results for their country.|$|E
50|$|As Minister of War, Costa e Silva defended {{interests}} of <b>hard-liners,</b> <b>the</b> ultra-right {{faction of the}} Armed Forces. As such he was considered an acceptable candidate to succeed Castelo Branco, who was judged to be too liberal. This also served well to isolate from power more moderate soldiers - such as future President Ernesto Geisel and his future chief aide Golbery do Couto e Silva.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{his first}} {{activities}} as defense minister was to initiate the cleansing of <b>the</b> society from <b>hard-liner</b> communists and informers. He stated his aim as defense minister to transform the ministry into [...] "an integrated civilian-military institution". During his tenure Baudyš was informed that the Czech army had had pathogens. He ordered the destruction of them {{due to the fact}} that they were no longer necessary.|$|R
50|$|Lamsdorf did {{not share}} the Tsar’s {{position}} that Russia was destined to rule East Asia, and cooperated with Finance Minister Sergey Witte and War Minister Aleksey Kuropatkin to curtail {{the influence of the}} Bezobrazov Circle over the Tsar. He proposed to relinquish Russia's commercial and industrial enterprises in Korea to obtain an agreement with Japan, in order to safeguard her interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and avoid complications with Great Britain. However, he was steadily sidelined by <b>the</b> jingoist <b>hard-liners</b> from <b>the</b> military, especially after the appointment of Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev as Viceroy of the Far East and events continued their downward spiral towards war, with Lamsdorf seemingly resigned to its inevitability.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 and 1978 the Presidential {{succession}} issue caused further political {{confrontation with}} <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners.</b> Noting that Brazil {{was only a}} [...] "relative democracy," [...] Geisel attempted in April 1977 to restrain the growing strength of the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party by creating an electoral college that elect the next President.

5000|$|A strong votary of swadeshi, he {{was seen}} as one of <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> within the RSS. [...] He had often criticised the National Democratic Alliance {{government}} {{in general and the}} Bharatiya Janata Party in particular for its economic policies. In 2005, his statements suggesting that both Atal Behari Vajpayee and L.K.Advani step aside and let a younger leadership take charge of the BJP created a rift within the Sangh parivar. He stepped down as Sarsanghachalak on 21 March 2009, due to poor health.|$|E

[...] "No {{progress}} is possible {{as long as the}} Bush administration and the Ehud Olmert government persist in their current position of refusing to recognize a unity government that includes Hamas. The recent meeting between Condoleezza Rice, Abbas, and Olmert turned into an empty formality," [...] said Soros. This was playing into the hands of <b>the</b> <b>hard-liners</b> in Hamas, increasing the influence of Syria and Iran, and would escalate the fighting, Soros said.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} of two chairmen {{was meant to}} symbolize cooperation between the two factions of the party but Andersen died shortly after, leaving the young Sohn with the sole responsibility for settling the internal struggles in the party.

They managed to win the power struggle and in 1990 they deposed him. This led to a party congress where the Sohn faction won and the party was split. However a year after he left the communist party and joined the Socialist People's Party.|$|R
