25|$|Specimen {{geometry}} during <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> uncontrolled, yet controls projection behaviour, hence {{there is}} little control over the magnification. This induces distortions into the computer generated 3D dataset.

This yields strong spatial distortions in the final image.|$|E

25|$|Typically the LCOE is {{calculated}} over the design lifetime of a plant, {{which is usually}} 20 to 40 years, and given in the units of currency per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-day, for example AUD/kWh or EUR/kWh or per megawatt-hour, for example AUD/MWh (as tabulated below). However, care should be taken in comparing different LCOE studies and {{the sources of the}} information as the LCOE for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions, financing terms and technological deployment analyzed. In particular, assumption of capacity factor has significant impact on the calculation of LCOE. Thus, a key requirement for <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions.|$|E
