5|$|The LHQ Medical Research Unit used human <b>test</b> <b>subjects,</b> all volunteers {{drawn from}} the Australian Army, {{including}} a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other <b>test</b> <b>subjects,</b> which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical Research Unit researched quinine, sulphonamides, atebrin, plasmoquine, and paludrine.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} taking missions, the three {{learn that the}} city's ruling Cardinals are directly responsible for the crisis. Over twenty years before, Prelate Frieda envisioned a world where people were free of Zenith's control. While she was popular among the Cardinals, with her closest ally being Cardinal Rowen, her ideals led to her being killed by extremists. Rowen was thrown into despair by her death, and when shown the truth about Zenith by Cardinal Sullivan, he is convinced {{to work with the}} other Cardinals to fulfill Frieda's vision. Rowen and Sullivan create <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> programmed to die at specific times: Leanne was #20, designed to die on her 20th birthday. A sympathetic scientist named Juris freed Leanne, and when she learned the truth, she tried to commit suicide before being saved by Zephyr. At the same time, Sullivan studied Rebecca, who had developed natural immunity to the poisons beyond Basel's borders, and sought a way of imprinting her powers onto others. Zephyr was one of his <b>test</b> <b>subjects,</b> along with Zephyr's sister, who was killed by Zephyr during his rampage.|$|E

5|$|Hepatitis: During the 1940s the cause, {{method of}} {{communication}} and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not well understood. Experimentation began with COs working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The men were inoculated with infected blood plasma, swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients, and drank contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Mara Aramov arrives {{to shoot}} Phagan, but she convinces Gabe and Lian {{that she came}} to help. The three travel to PharCom's {{warehouses}} in hopes of preventing Rhoemer from launching a missile. Lian reveals that the serum Gabe injected into the <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> was really a lethal chemical, and Markinson was having them killed. Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.|$|E
5|$|Markinson gives Gabe {{a report}} on the virus called Syphon Filter, a {{bioweapon}} that one can program on a genetic level to target specific groups of people. Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> with a vaccine and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter, and she says there is no universal cure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the movie}} dramatization there were {{actually}} 25 levels of increasing voltage and pain.

50|$|Clinton McIntyre, {{guilty of}} killing his {{commanding}} officer, is offered leniency by General Maxfield Saunders {{to act as}} a <b>test</b> <b>subject</b> for Dr. Abraham Erskine's super-soldier serum. Unhappy with the choice of Steve Rogers as the <b>test</b> <b>subject,</b> General Saunders gives McIntyre the serum before Rogers arrives. McIntyre indeed becomes stronger and faster, but almost immediately goes berserk with pain, smashing the lab. After rushing out to the street, he attacks a motorist before collapsing and dying of a heart attack. There are two additional additives that must be given to the <b>test</b> <b>subject</b> after drinking the serum, unknown to Saunders.|$|R
5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating <b>test</b> <b>subjects.</b> Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{massacre}} of the Uchiha clan {{at the start of}} the series, there were only four living people who possess the Sharingan: Sasuke Uchiha; his brother, Itachi; Obito Uchiha; and Kakashi Hatake. Itachi had died prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, in which Obito meets his demise while Kakashi has his Sharingan removed in exchange for his normal eye. Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> who has a unique ability of accepting tissue and organ transplantation, Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage. Sasuke's daughter, Sarada, also eventually awakens her own Sharingan.|$|E

5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> were {{injected with}} plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|Orochimaru, however, craved {{more power}} than could be {{obtained}} from training with his master, and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims. Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning of his actions, Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village. In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori. However, after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the Sharingan failed, Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki. Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village, Otogakure, populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as <b>test</b> <b>subjects</b> in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns to do his dirty work.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{through the}} marsh, they find Stone injured but safe and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects {{himself with a}} variant of the Las Plagas {{parasite}} and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human <b>test</b> <b>subjects.</b> Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Redfield and Alomar pursue Gionne, but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Redfield and Alomar fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Redfield to follow Wesker.|$|E
