5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, and none of <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|None of <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> of Banksia sphaerocarpa are {{commonly}} seen in cultivation. They {{are difficult to}} grow in the wetter conditions of Australia's east coast.

Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} topological algebras is {{a class of}} topological algebras closed under taking Tychonov products, closed subalgebras and {{continuous}} homomorphic images.

The structure of <b>the</b> lattice of <b>varieties</b> of discrete bands was elucidated by Birjukov [1], Fennemore [2] and Gerhard [3]. The result can be transfered immediately to the lattice of pseudovarieties of finite bands, since the free band over any finite alphabet is finite [4]. A profinite variety of semigroups is a class of profinite semigroups closed under Tychonov products, closed subsemigroups, and profinite homomorphic images. <b>The</b> lattice of <b>varieties</b> of profinite semigroups is isomorphic to the lattice of pseudovarieties of finite semigroups [5].

5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on Romanian grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> of Romanian and create a standard Romanian lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was to be employed in creating the Romanian Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in Muntenia, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve as the standard language.|$|E
