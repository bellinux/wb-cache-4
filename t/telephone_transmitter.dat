25|$|On February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed {{a patent}} caveat for a {{telephone}} {{on the very}} same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The water transmitter described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitter</b> tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the théâtrophone {{can be traced to}} a telephonic {{transmission}} system demonstrated by Clément Ader at the 1881 World Expo in Paris. The system was inaugurated by the French President Jules Grévy, and allowed broadcasting of concerts or plays. Ader had arranged 80 <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitters</b> across the front of a stage to create a form of binaural stereophonic sound. It was the first two-channel audio system, and consisted of a series of <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitters</b> connected from the stage of the Paris Opera to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where the visitors could hear Comédie-Française and opera performances in stereo using two headphones; the Opera was located more than two kilometers away from the venue. In a note dated 11 November 1881, Victor Hugo describes his first experience of théâtrophone as pleasant.|$|R
2500|$|Bell's <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitter</b> (microphone) {{consisted}} of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron [...] "armature" [...] induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which {{consisted of}} an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{proliferation}} of vacuum tube amplifiers in the 1920s, carbon microphones were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals. They were widely used in telephone systems until the 1980s, while other applications used different microphone designs much earlier. Their low cost, inherently high output and frequency response characteristic were well suited for telephony. For {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS), carbon-microphone based telephones can still be used without modification. Carbon microphones, usually modified <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitters,</b> were widely used in early AM radio broadcasting systems, but their limited frequency response, as well as a fairly high noise level, led to their abandonment in those applications by the late 1920s. They continued to be widely used for low-end public address, and military and amateur radio applications for some decades afterward.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Many {{interesting}} application {{problems on}} terrains involve visibility computations.

An exhaustive survey of visibility related problems is provided by Nagy (1994). The solution of such problems needs methods to efficiently answer visibility queries or the development of some structures encoding the visibility situation of a terrain. Visibility queries consist of determining whether a given object located on a terrain is visible from a viewpoint and possibly `how much' of the object is visible. Visibility structures provide information about the visibility of the terrain itself: the knowledge of suitable visibility structures fo...|$|R

Many of these amplified instruments could also be played unamplified. Commercially produced jazz guitars from the 1940s on were most commonly hollow body guitars with pickups.One significant acoustic-electric guitar was the Ovation Roundback developed by Charles Hancock Kaman in 2002, built from fiberglass and based on his research as an aerospace engineer into the vibration of helicopter rotor blades. He added electrical pickups to provide the option of amplification. The Kaman Music Corporation, built on the success of the Roundback, became one of the largest music instrument manufacturers in the United States.|$|R
30|$|Several {{prototype}} nephelometer-based {{smoke detection}} systems were developed and trialled by initially sampling airflows in air-conditioning ductwork in several Australia <b>telephone</b> exchanges, <b>transmitter</b> facilities, a space tracking station and a hospital, and {{the principle of}} high sensitivity, very early warning smoke detection was borne. Later, small bore pipework or aspirated smoke sampling systems were added, together with three level alarms outputs, outside air compensation, and other patented developments.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{communication}} system, a transmitter encodes {{a message to}} a signal, which is carried to a receiver by the communications channel. For example, the words [...] "Mary had a little lamb" [...] might be the message spoken into a telephone.

The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds.|$|E

50|$|The first {{vacuum-tube}} {{hearing aid}} was patented by a Naval engineer Earl Hanson in 1920. It {{was called the}} Vactuphone and used the <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitter</b> to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried. Marconi in England and Western Electric in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitters</b> through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|R

During World War I the original Marconi spark transmitter was replaced with an Alexanderson alternator, {{the invention of the}} General Electric engineer, with an output power of 200 kilowatts and looking like an ordinary power station generator. Its frequency was around 17 kHz, which made its wavelength around 17,500 meters.|$|E
5000|$|Collins {{began his}} writing career in 1901, and his {{articles}} about wireless telephony appeared in Electrical World, Scientific American, Encyclopedia Americana, and other encyclopedias.

60|$|Paley {{had put the}} {{argument}} in an apparently unanswerable form. If you found a watch, full of mechanism exquisitely adapted to produce a series of operations all leading to the fulfilment of one central purpose of measuring for mankind the march {{of the day and}} night, could you believe that it was not the work of a cunning artificer who had designed and contrived it all to that end? And here was a far more wonderful thing than a watch, a man with all his organs ingeniously contrived, cords and levers, girders and kingposts, circulating systems of pipes and valves, dialysing membranes, chemical retorts, carburettors, ventilators, inlets and outlets, <b>telephone</b> <b>transmitters</b> in his ears, light recorders and lenses in his eye: was it conceivable that this was the work of chance? that no artificer had wrought here? that there was no purpose in this, no design, no guiding intelligence? The thing was incredible. In vain did Helmholtz declare that 'the eye has every possible defect that can be found in an optical instrument, and even some peculiar to itself,' and that 'if an optician tried to sell me an instrument which had all these defects I should think myself quite justified in blaming his carelessness in the strongest terms, and sending him back his instrument.' To discredit the optician's skill was not {{to get rid of the}} optician. The eye might not be so cleverly made as Paley thought, but it was made somehow, by somebody.|$|R

50|$|In most {{landline}} <b>telephones,</b> the <b>transmitter</b> {{and receiver}} (microphone and speaker) {{are located in}} the handset, although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure. Powered by the line, the microphone (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm. The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the coil of the receiver (A3). The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver's diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter.|$|R
