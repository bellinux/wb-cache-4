5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Within {{twenty years}} of the Norman conquest, the former Anglo-Saxon elite were {{replaced}} by {{a new class of}} Norman nobility, with around 8,000 Normans and French settling in England. The new earls (successors to the ealdermen), sheriffs and church seniors were all drawn from their ranks. In many areas of society there was continuity, as the Normans adopted many of the Anglo-Saxon governmental institutions, including the tax system, mints and the centralisation of law-making and some judicial matters; initially sheriffs and the hundred courts continued to function as before. The existing <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> were captured in Domesday Book, produced in 1086.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{attorney}} general, White {{was in charge of}} several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuit of <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> from railroad companies. Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in the lower courts, and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court, which compelled the railroads to pay taxes to the state.|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. The for-profit {{business}} must maximise owners' wealth {{over the}} long term. It is accomplished by legally structuring the lease to minimise <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Accounting profits and <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> arising from the lease are determined in different ways: different lease structures could result in similar accounting profits, but different <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> A lease's accounting profits may be preestimated with relative certainty, but it's difficult to pre-estimate its <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> It's especially difficult with long-term leases that stretch {{over a number of}} accounting periods and tax years. There isn't a specific framework with which <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> arising from the lease of immovable property may be determined and minimised. This study focuses on determining and minimising income <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> {{within the context of the}} leasing of immovable property in South Africa. The workings of the factors that give rise to the <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> are distinguished. Different types oflease agreements, reflecting the commercial objectives, are identified. A framework is then constructed from these factors to simplizy determination of the <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> and to structure the lease so that <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> may be reduced. The different types of lease agreements are imposed on the framework to subordinate the reduction of <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> to the parties' commercial objectives...|$|R

It may be refunded if it is determined, when a [...] is filed, that the recipient's <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> to the government which received the {{withholding tax}} is less than the tax withheld, or additional tax may be due if it is determined that the recipient's <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> is more than the withholding tax. In some cases the withholding tax is treated as discharging the recipient's <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> and no <b>tax</b> return or additional tax is required.

5|$|White {{was elected}} as West Virginia's {{attorney}} general in 1876 and served from 1877 until 1881. He was charged with several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuance of <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> from railroad companies. White argued the case before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor and ultimately enriched the West Virginia state treasury. He successfully secured the extradition of Elihu Gregg from Pennsylvania after Gregg was accused of burning the Preston County courthouse and fled. In Kitzmiller v. Williams, White argued {{in favor of the}} rights of former Confederate soldiers before the Supreme Court of the United States and secured a favorable verdict. Following his tenure as attorney general, White served two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates. In 1885, he represented the state at the Washington Monument's dedication. White subsequently served two terms as the city solicitor of Wheeling, and was later counsel for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.|$|E
25|$|Curzon was {{involved}} in several legal cases. In 1894 his financial failure {{was the subject of}} a successful court action against him. In 1901 he and Charles Hawtrey were jointly sued for slander by a disgruntled actor; they won the case. In 1910 Curzon appeared in court in two separate cases, a dispute with the lessor of his theatre over <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and in another slander case, this time as plaintiff, against an acquaintance who falsely alleged that Curzon left his first wife penniless after their divorce in 1909. Curzon, who in fact allowed his ex-wife £25 a week (equivalent to about £2,000 in 2007 values), won the case but was awarded only nominal damages.|$|E
25|$|Tax evasion {{has long}} saddled Argentina's public finances, {{shifting}} the burden {{to the middle}} and working classes by way of high value-added taxes (which are easier to collect). Improvements in enforcement since the 1990s have abated the problem from its peak in the 1980s, when fully half of all <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> (and most income taxes) were evaded. Nevertheless, Hernán Arbizu, a former JP Morgan Chase executive, testified in 2013 and 2014 on how Argentine firms and wealthy Argentine clients still evade {{billions of dollars in}} taxes using local banks and exchange houses. Among those implicated were the Clarín Media Group; energy firm Petrobras Argentina; electricity distributor Edesur; the late María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat and her executor, Congressman Alfonso Prat-Gay; former YPF head Sebastián Eskenazi; and the late television host Bernardo Neustadt.|$|E

25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
25|$|This {{would suggest}} that the Bush tax cut policy was highly regressive, but some writers, notably at the Koch-funded Tax Foundation, argue that the concept of a {{progressive}} tax should be detached from its traditional association with income redistribution, noting that since the share of income of the most wealthy rose so much during the period, their share of the total tax burden went up even as their tax rates went down. Between 2003 and 2004, following the 2003 tax cuts, the share of after-tax income going to the top 1% rose from 12.2% in 2003 to 14.0% in 2004. (This followed the period from 2000 to 2002, where after-tax incomes declined the most for the top 1%.) At the same time, the share of overall <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the top 1% increased from 22.9% to 25.3%,. In this way, they claim, the tax system actually became more progressive between 2000 and 2004.|$|E
25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E

500|$|Ludlow Castle {{gradually}} became the Mortimer family's most important property, but {{for much of}} the rest of the century its owners were too young to control the castle personally. The castle was first briefly inherited by Mortimer's son, Edmund, and then in 1331 Mortimer's young grandson, Roger, who eventually became a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years War. Roger's young son, Edmund, inherited the castle in 1358, and also grew up to become involved in the war with France. Both Roger and Edmund used a legal device called [...] "the use", effectively giving Ludlow Castle to trustees during their lifetimes in exchange for annual payments; this reduced their <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and gave them more control over the distribution of the estates on their deaths. Edmund's son, another Roger, inherited the castle in 1381, but King Richard II took the opportunity of Roger's minority to exploit the Mortimer estates until they were put into the control of a committee of major nobles. When Roger died in 1398, Richard again took wardship of the castle on behalf of the young heir, Edmund, until he was deposed from power in 1399.|$|E

500|$|Heyer {{was noted}} for the {{thorough}} historical detail she invested in her works – unlike her literary predecessors, who typically {{lived in the}} eras they wrote about, Heyer had to enliven the past for her contemporary readers; she thus endeavored to research every available aspect of her chosen plot settings. Despite the popularity of her romance novels, Heyer did not consider herself a romance writer and had ambivalent feelings towards the genre, dismissing her stories as [...] "another bleeding romance." [...] Heyer published historical novels such as The Conqueror (1931), which depicted {{the early years of}} William I. The careful detail found in her 1937 historical romance, An Infamous Army, attracted critical acclaim. Her other novels never reached this level of positive critical opinion and have been largely overlooked by scholars. Heyer aspired for many years to produce [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years," [...] a medieval trilogy featuring the House of Lancaster. This project failed to come to full fruition, as she faced pressure from eager readers to continue publishing her popular romance novels; the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> she dealt with were also a factor.
