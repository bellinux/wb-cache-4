25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level <b>today.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

Now <b>today</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

2500|$|Today, Diophantine {{analysis}} {{is the area}} of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most {{of the problems in}} Arithmetica lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations: , , and [...] The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while <b>today</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only one case, is {{that he did not have}} any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers , , [...] to all be positive in each of the three cases above. [...] Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered negative or irrational square root solutions [...] "useless", [...] "meaningless", and even [...] "absurd". To give one specific example, he calls the equation [...] 'absurd' because it would lead to a negative value for [...] One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation.

2500|$|Among {{these three}} catalogues, ldan-dkar-ma, {{included}} in the volume Jo of sna-tsogs in sde-ge bka’-bstan, is generally {{believed to be the}} only surviving so far. But recently a manuscript of dkar-chag phang-thang-ma is discovered and published from Tibet. It contains 961 titles listed under 34 subject headings with additional information of numbers of verses (soloka and bampo [...] ) that contains in each text. The ldan-dkar-ma catalogue comprises 735 titles and listed under a category of 27 subject headings. An interesting unique feature of Tibetan catalogue is that, alongside information about the source material of translation and the bibliographical details, it gives in physical descriptions, such as the nos. of words, verses, canto (bampo) and folios-pages in each of textual contents. Thus <b>today</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a record of 73 million words contained in the bka’-’gyur & bstan-’gyur collection. According to the latest edition of Dharma Publication, the bKa’-‘gyur contains 1,115 texts, spread over 65,420 Tibetan folios amounting to 450,000 lines or 25 million words. Likewise, the bsTan-'gyur contains 3,387 texts using 127,000 folios amounting to 850,000 lines and 48 millions words. The sum total of both these collections is 4,502 texts in 73 millions words. By fixing bampo to verses and to words of each of the textual contents, the individual works are interpolation and alteration. This further strengthened the authenticity of Tibetan Buddhist literature.|$|E
