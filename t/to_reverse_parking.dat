In this article {{we focus on the}} implementation of a <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> assistance and more precisely, a <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> manoeuvre planner. This paper is based on a manoeuvre planning technique presented in previous work and specialised in planning <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> manoeuvre. Since {{a key part of the}} previous method was not explicited, our goal in this paper is to present a practical and reproducible way <b>to</b> implement a <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> manoeuvre planner. Our implementation uses a database engine to search for the elementary movements that will make the complete parking manoeuvre. Our results have been successfully tested on a real platform: the CSIRO Autonomous Tractor. ...|$|R
50|$|Canada's Worst Parking Lot - The annual non-race to park {{a car in}} an open {{parking space}} has all five contestants driving five {{different}} luxury vehicles, with the additional requirement of having <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> into their <b>parking</b> spaces.

25|$|The <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure.

Shifting <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the <b>reverse</b> <b>park</b> guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, and adjustment arrows; <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> adds rotation selection).

50|$|The {{site was}} remodelled over {{the turn of}} 2009 and 2010. A new {{entrance}} was built directly off the roundabout, with a new bus stop and shelter, and a raised kerb.

The rearrangement also provides more spaces. A new bus shelter was due to be installed at the site on 24 November 2009, leading to the closure of the site to buses from 11am, with temporary bus stops on the main road outside, although this didn't happen as planned. The site was closed at a later date for a longer period, with buses using stops on the main road for around a month. The newly remodelled site was completed on 22 January 2010, at which point buses started to enter the site again.|$|R

50|$|The Water Tank Challenge - A Jeep Grand Wagoneer with 200 litres {{of water}} is used for this annual challenge. The {{obstacle}} course this year consists of a slow portion, which includes a sudden stop <b>to</b> accommodate a <b>reversing</b> <b>parked</b> car, an acceleration to 30 km/h, a gradual deceleration and turn, and then a slow bump that concludes the challenge. In Andrew's demonstration run, he loses 20 litres of 200, mostly from the bump that has also soaked him in previous years. Sly doesn't brake at all in his run, and collides into the reversing car. He proceeds to power his way forwards, not realizing that the hitting of obstacles {{has resulted in a}} flat tire in the front right tire heading into the acceleration portion. He loses 100 litres in his run. Aaron also nearly collides into the car, losing control of the car as he powers forward. He also loses 100 litres. Afiya loses 120 litres in her run. Shirley only loses 35 litres and does not hit anything, only losing water at the bump. Tab goes through the course too fast, losing 90 litres in her run. Ben loses 50 litres in his run, all from intentionally soaking Jan {{in the beginning of the}} run; when he drives seriously through the acceleration portion and thereafter, he does not lose a single drop, even on the hump, and even as he goes over speed (35 km/h) on the acceleration portion.|$|R

5000|$|Canada's Worst Parking Lot: All {{the drivers}} admit to having caused {{at least one}} {{accident}} while {{in a parking lot}} (even Siham, who is regarded as the best-behaved of the drivers, once broke her driving-side mirror), leading to this semi-regular challenge being held. Each driver has a different car, and is required <b>to</b> <b>reverse</b> into a <b>parking</b> spot when it opens up; furthermore, each driver is permitted no more than three or four turns while parking. Mariah and Siham quickly get into parking spots, but fail for taking too long to do it. Chanie (who is disadvantaged by having by far the largest vehicle) reverses into a marked [...] "parent with child" [...] spot and then smashes the sign, while Jason hits a bus and then illegally parks in a disabled spot, a mistake which Mariah then also makes. It then turns out that Mariah is severely ignorant about parking laws, which she denies even exist. Tyler becomes the first person to park, doing so without any trouble, while Chanie fails another two attempts due to hitting another car and poorly aligned parking respectively. Siham then passes, with Mariah also passing shortly after that, though their techniques are far from perfect. After more and more failed attempts from Chanie and Jason, Andrew calls a halt to the challenge, and declares that they have both failed.|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} visual- and auditory-based assisted driving technologies, haptic modality {{promises to be}} more effective and less disturbing assistance to the driver. However, in most previous studies, haptic assistance systems were evaluated from safety and stability viewpoints. Moreover, the effect of haptic assistance on human driving behavior has not been sufficiently discussed. In this paper, we introduce an assisted driving method based on haptic assistance for driver training in <b>reverse</b> <b>parking,</b> which is considered as an uncertain factor in conventional assisted driving systems. The proposed system assists the driver by applying a torque on the steering wheel to guide proper and well-timed steering. To design the appropriate assistance method, we conducted a measurement experiment to determine the qualitative <b>reverse</b> <b>parking</b> driver characteristics. Based on the determined characteristics, we propose a haptic assistance calculation method that utilizes the receding horizon control algorithm. For a simulation environment to assess the proposed assistance method, we also developed a scaled car simulator comprising a 1 / 10 scaled robot car and an omnidirectional camera. We used the scaled car simulator to conduct comparative experiments on subjects, and observed that the driving skills of the assisted subjects were significantly better than those of the control subjects...|$|R
