5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend.

On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. <b>The</b> <b>gold</b> was finally deposited at the Bank of England.

5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform.

The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, re{{gained control of}} the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.|$|E
