The conduct of Napoleon I, when he became emperor (18 May 1804) towards Pius VII was most offensive to the papacy; but even during those years when Napoleon was ill-treating Pius VII and keeping him a prisoner, Catholicism in France was reviving and expanding day by day. Numerous religious congregations came to life again or grew up rapidly, often under the guidance of simple priests or humble women. <b>The</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Christian Schools of Mercy, who work in hospitals and schools, date from 1802, as do <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Providence <b>of</b> Langres; <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Mercy of Montauban from 1804; <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart of Jesus at St-Julien-du-Gua date from 1805.
