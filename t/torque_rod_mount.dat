40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. NPSAT 1 is a gravity-gradient friendly, prolate body designed to fly at 600 Å 40 km inclined to 34. 5 degrees. The satellite uses a magnetic 3 -axis active {{attitude control system}} (ACS) using magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> that interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This thesis accomplishes three goals. The first objective was to verify and to validate the magnetic attitude control system program and model developed by Leonard. The verification and validation process was completed in two steps. The first step accomplished an independent modeling of the Earth's magnetic field using MATLAB. The second step completed a verification via inspection of Leonard's ACS SIMULINK model. The verification confirmed that Leonard's modular sub-components of the disturbance torques, the quaternion vectors, the Euler angles, the spacecraft kinematics and dynamics, and the ACS control laws conformed to current ACS empirical theory. The second goal was to establish a laboratory used to demonstrate the ACS robustness and ability to perform as designed. The laboratory was created to house an air-bearing platform that simulates NPSAT 1 characteristics. The third goal was to perform hardware-in-the-loop experiments with the NPSAT 1 ACS software and model. Hardwarein- the-loop tests were performed to the magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> driver circuit board, micro-controller computer, and control interfaces.

40|$|A {{method of}} using {{magnetic}} <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> to do 3 -axis spacecraft attitude control has been developed. The {{goal of this}} system is to achieve a nadir pointing accuracy {{on the order of}} 0. 1 to 1. 0 deg without the need for thrusters or wheels. The open-loop system is under-actuated because magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> cannot <b>torque</b> about the local magnetic field direction. This direction moves in space as the spacecraft moves along an inclined orbit, and the resulting system is roughly periodic. Periodic controllers are designed using an asymptotic linear quadratic regulator technique. The control laws include integral action and saturation logic. This system's performance has been studied via analysis and simulation. The resulting closed-loop systems are robust with respect to parametric modeling uncertainty. They converge from initial attitude errors of 30 deg per axis, and they achieve steady-state pointing errors on the order of 0. 5 to 1. 0 deg in the presence of drag torques and unmodeled residual dipole moments...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis considers {{the problem of}} time-optimal spacecraft slew maneuvers. Since the work of Bilimoria and Wie it has been known that the time-optimal reorientation of a symmetric rigid body was not the eigenaxis maneuver {{once thought to be}} correct. Here, this concept is extended to axisymmetric and asymmetric rigid body reorientations with idealized independent torque generating devices. The premise that the time-optimal maneuver is not, in general, an eigenaxis maneuver, is shown to hold for all spacecraft configurations. The methodology is then extended to include spacecraft control systems employing magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods,</b> a combination of pitch bias wheel with magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods,</b> and finally to control systems employing single gimbal control moment gyros.

40|$|Abstract: {{this paper}} {{describes}} the attitude determination and control system for a nanosatellite (30 kg), using geomagnetic field data and solar panels as sun sensors, applied to a spinning nanosatellite (Penn State Univer-sity’s LionSat). LionSat will map plasma densities in the ram and wake of the vehicle’s path, using two hybrid plasma probes that rotate with the spacecraft. Attitude will be determined {{using a combination of}} voltage out-puts from contiguous solar panels and a three-axis magnetometer (TAM). To correct for spin-axis drift due to orbital plane nodal regression (approximately five degrees per day), two magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> will provide the necessary control actuation. To avoid corrupting the TAM and plasma probe measurements, periodic quiescent intervals for the <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> are required. Initial design concepts for this mission employed an extended Kalman filter, implemented onboard to predict attitude during the passive control intervals; making use of digital sun sensors as part of the attitude determination scheme; however, budget limitations have resulted in the need to employ the body-mounted solar panels (sides and end caps) to estimate the sun vector. Simulation results indi-cate that the solar-panel sun sensors (in conjunction with the TAM) can produce the required attitude knowledge for processing the scientific data; the pointing accuracy for spin-axis control (nominally within 5 degrees of or...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDesign requirements {{for a small}} satellite (NPSAT- 1) Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft which requires a control attitude of +/- 1. 0 degrees and knowledge attitude of +/- 0. 1 degree. Several design aspects are considered in development of attitude control systems for a small satellite, such as: spacecraft dynamics, space environment, disturbance torques, orbit type, and spacecraft complexity. The ideal spacecraft's attitude sensor is a rate gyroscope, which provides rate information to the attitude control system. In the case of NPSAT- 1, due to budget constraints alternative sensors will be utilized, such as: a three-axis magnetometer, earth sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS). A small satellite designed to have a three-axis stabilized, biased momentum system, must have a robust control system and requires a momentum wheel to provide stiffness to maintain attitude, and magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> on each axis. The current design of NPSAT- 1 uses all of these sensors to provide rate information for damping and stability to the control system that requires a complicated attitude control design. The purpose of this attitude control design simulation is to investigate and propose a control law utilizing a single pitch momentum wheel and three magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>rods.</b> A further proposal is to utilize a constant speed momentum wheel to avoid momentum damping and over speed, replace the pitch control with magnetic torquers, and develop a Kalman filter estimator to provide all the required angular rates.

40|$|Volvo Cars {{is in need}} of a {{development}} method to be used for in-house new product development of powertrain mounts. The current development process includes development of requirements in-house and component design by an external supplier. To reduce the development lead-time and cost Volvo Cars is investigating the possibilities to do component design of powertrain mounts in-house. It is suggested to use structural optimization as a tool in the design work. A method for using structural optimization to design the geometry of powertrain mounts to meet stiffness specifications has been developed in this project. The project focused on shape optimization of <b>torque</b> <b>rods</b> to meet static stiffness requirement. An iterative approach was used, where the optimization method was developed using a simplified <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> to facilitate the development. It was also studied if it is possible to obtain material parameters to sufficiently accurate model rubber materials by doing tensile tests on rubber from existing components. Finally, the optimization method was applied to a real Volvo <b>torque</b> <b>rod</b> for validation and adjustment. The proposed optimization method is based on finite element (FE) modelling of the mount. A concept geometry and a requirement stiffness curve are needed as input to the method. An FE model of the concept geometry is created and then morphed, creating shapes that are used as design variables. The morphing enables controlled geometry changes that are used in the optimization. An objective function, that represents the sum of the squared distances that a certain design’s displacement values for certain force levels deviates from the required displacement values, is used to determine the goodness of the design. The shape of the FE model is then optimized by changing the shapes to minimizing the value of the objective function. The output from the optimization method is an optimized mount geometry that can be used as basis in final design work. The proposed method is performing well; it is able to optimize a concept geometry far from the final geometry into a shape that has a static stiffness close to the required. It is also able to fine-tune the shape of a full-feature geometry to a static stiffness very close to the requirement. The method is very flexible, and additional optimization constraints can easily be added. The proposed optimization method has potential of being an important tool in new product development of powertrain mounts or other rubber components. A modified version of the method was also shown to be useful for optimizing hyperelastic material parameters to model a certain rubber compound more accurately...|$|R
