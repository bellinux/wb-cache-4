5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> such as the arrangement of the footsteps {{at the front of the}} locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E

5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing {{to pay for their}} college.|$|E

25|$|All 10 {{ships were}} {{laid down in}} 1905, with the first four ships of the Artigliere group {{completed}} in 1907, with the remaining ships delivered in 1910. In 1910, China placed an order for a single destroyer based on the Soldato class, to be named Ching Po or Tsing Po. This ship {{was to have a}} gun armament of two 76mm and four 47mm guns, and was designed to use mixed fuel, with one boiler being coal-fired and two being oil-fired. In 1912, the under-construction ship was acquired by Italy, and renamed Ascaro.

500|$|No. A805 {{was put on}} {{performance}} trials prior to work commencing on rebuilding of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> at Brighton and Eastleigh works. The rebuilds lost their names because of the bad publicity attached to the [...] "River" [...] class after the 1927 crash, and the heavily damaged No. A800 was the last member of the K class to be rebuilt to U class configuration in December 1928. The unique 3-cylinder [...] "River" [...] tank, K1 class No. A890 River Frome was also rebuilt to the general U class specification, becoming the prototype of Maunsell's 3-cylinder U1 class derivative in June 1928.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships were}} armed with ten 10.5cm SK L/40 guns in single mounts.

The guns could engage targets out to [...] They were {{supplied}} with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun, though the allotment {{for the last three}} ships increased to 1,500 rounds, or 150 per gun. They were also equipped with torpedo tubes. Gazelle had three [...] tubes with eight torpedoes; one was submerged in the hull in the bow and two were mounted in deck launchers on the broadside. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> only had two 45cm tubes with five torpedoes, and these were submerged in the ships' hulls, on the broadside.|$|E
500|$|Other {{modifications}} {{included the}} lengthening of valve travel, and fitting larger outside steam pipes {{to streamline the}} flow of steam into the cylinders. Fifteen locomotives of this revised design were built in 1927, and some were given [...] six-wheeled tenders for use on the Southern Railway's Central section. This allowed the locomotive to be turned on the shorter turntables found on {{this part of the}} network. From new, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> was equipped with the Urie [...] eight-wheel bogie tender, which allowed the class to operate on the extended freight routes of the Southern Railway's Western section. The standardisation measures undertaken by both Urie and Maunsell were soon vindicated by the fact that tenders and other parts were swapped with those of other classes on the Southern Railway when locomotives were under overhaul.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{successful}} use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos.E448E457, the mechanically similar [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925. The performance of those {{allocated to the}} Eastern section was indifferent, and failed to improve upon the double-headed ex-SECR 4-4-0s they were to replace. Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel axleboxes were common from crewmen and shed fitters. After investigation, the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract. [...] Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch, and necessitated six replacement boilers, re-riveting, re-fitting of tubes and replacement of firebox stays. The hot driving wheel axleboxes were caused by the main frames being out of alignment. A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives {{should be taken to}} Eastleigh for repair. Once repaired, the [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved as capable as <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> in service.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> {{remained}} in {{hands of the}} Yugoslav Navy. On 6 October, Hasan Zahirović-Laca along with the Koni-class frigate Koper (VPBR-32) {{took part in the}} Battle of Zadar. Croatian coastal batteries in the area operated two captured Bofors [...] guns with only one of them being in position to open fire on the ships. The initial five to six rounds fired at Hasan Zahirović-Laca missed their target, after which the gun malfunctioned. After a quick repair, the missile boat was targeted again, with three rounds hitting the stern section and causing no damage because the gun crew didn't have armor-piercing ammunition at their disposal. Two Končar-class missile boats also took part in the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. Jordan Nikolov-Orce, operating under the codename [...] "Parak", and Ante Banina, under the codename [...] "Pakra", were members of the tactical group [...] "Vis" [...] which was tasked with enforcing a naval blocade of the city of Split and the surrounding islands. With the Yugoslav Peoples Army endings its campaign in Croatia, all ships of the class, excluding Vlado Ćetković, were relocated to Montenegro where they were commissioned with the new FR Yugoslav Navy of Serbia and Montenegro.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} months, the two railway companies ran comparative exchange trials {{between the two}} types from which the Great Western emerged triumphant with 4079 Pendennis Castle. The LNER learned valuable lessons from the trials {{which resulted in a}} series of modifications carried out from 1926 on number 4477 Gay Crusader. Changes to the valve gear included increased lap and longer travel, in accordance with Great Western practice; this allowed fuller exploitation of the expansive properties of steam and reduced back pressure from the exhaust, transforming performance and economy; the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that had previously been impossible. There followed a complete redesign of the valve gear, which was applied to 2555 Centenary in 1927, with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> being modified in due course. Locomotives with modified valve gear had a slightly raised running plate over the cylinders in order to give room for the longer combination lever necessary for the longer valve travel. Another modification was made in 1927 when number 4480 Enterprise was fitted with a [...] boiler. This was closely followed by two other locomotives which also incorporated variations in the cylinder diameter and superheater size for comparative purposes. This led Gresley to make a radical departure from Churchward practice by increasing the number of large tubes containing superheating elements, hence increasing the superheater surface area in contact with the hot gases, thus raising steam temperature. The presence of the larger superheater could be recognised from the square covers {{on either side of the}} smokebox, a feature that the locomotives retained throughout the rest of their existence.|$|E
