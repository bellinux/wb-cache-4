5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{began the}} regular season with twelve {{consecutive}} victories before losing to Iowa State by two points after losing {{the lead in the}} closing seconds of the game. Kansas' following game was against Iowa State; this time, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> won the game by a margin of nine points. <b>The</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> won their next four games before losing to Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Due to the lack of a shot-clock in 1957, the Cowboys held the ball for the final three and a half minutes in order to win the game 5654. Both of <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> regular season losses were in part due to poor ball control by <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> squad closed out {{the regular season}} with four more victories. <b>The</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> closed the regular season with a conference best 111, earning them the Big Seven Conference regular season crown and a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Kansas faced Southern Methodist and was forced into an {{overtime}} period. Behind 36 points by Chamberlain, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> won 7365 to advance to the regional finals. There, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> defeated Oklahoma City 8161 to reach the Final Four. Chamberlain posted 30 points in the contest, adding 15 rebounds. The twotime defending NCAA Tournament champions, San Francisco, faced Kansas in the Final Four's host site, Kansas City. With a field goal percentage of almost 60 percent, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> posted an 80–56 win to advance to the championship game against undefeated North Carolina, the number oneranked team in the country. Even though the Tar Heels were undefeated and ranked number 1 in the nation, Kansas entered the game as a 3point favorite, mostly because playing in Kansas City was a virtual home game.|$|E

5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents the University of Kansas in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 36head coaches and one interim head coach since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname Jayhawks. They played their first season without a head coach. Kansas joined the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the Big Eight Conference. <b>The</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the Big Eight disbanded. <b>The</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> have played in 1,179games during their 120seasons. In those seasons, seven coaches have led Kansas to postseason bowl games: George Sauer, Jack Mitchell, Pepper Rodgers, Don Fambrough, Bud Moore, Glen Mason and Mark Mangino. Four coaches have won conference championships with the Jayhawks: A. R. Kennedy, Bill Hargiss, Sauer and Rodgers.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned the ball over three times, while Kansas turned the ball over just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> an enormous advantage on the scoreboard. Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} heavy {{media attention}} with over ten television stations and seventy news reporters being represented. The North Carolina Tar Heels jumped {{out to an}} early 197 lead in the first half, before <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> were able to close the lead before halftime. In the second half, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> managed to fully overcome the deficit and take the lead. However, the Tar Heels were able {{to tie the game}} in the final minute, sending the game to overtime. The first overtime saw each team score a basket before time ran out, while the second overtime saw zero points scored due to poor offensive execution on both teams parts. The third overtime saw more action take place, with the Tar Heels winning the game 5453 as Joe Quigg made two free throws in the closing seconds to give the Tar Heels the lead.|$|E

5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> to increase their odds of winning the game. After <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E

5|$|On offense, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 344yards, 249of which came through the air.

Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas defense, {{which had}} been ill-regarded heading into the game, {{performed}} well, as MVP Aqib Talib finished the game with fivetackles {{in addition to the}} interception that he returned for a touchdown.

5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the National Championship game with an unblemished record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American Wilt Chamberlain, came into the game favored to win against the Tar Heels of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by <b>the</b> <b>Jayhawks</b> allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored its opponents 162–16.

In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season. Late in the fourth quarter, Reesing threw a ball that bounced off the facemask of wide receiver Dexton Fields before being intercepted. The interception set up a Kansas State touchdown that put Kansas into a 2421 hole with seven and a half minutes remaining.
