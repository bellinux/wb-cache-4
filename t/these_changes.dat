Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> or if <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> result in epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|NAD and NADH {{also differ}} in their fluorescence. NADH in {{solution}} has an emission peak at 460nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4nanoseconds, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> {{can be used to}} measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the game were changed for its Western release: <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> {{included}} the removal or alteration of several revealing costumes, the removal of visual and dialogue references to Gravure modelling, and changes to the ages of certain characters. Multiple sections of dialogue were re-recorded to match <b>these</b> <b>changes.</b> The game's Hot Springs scenario and associated costumes also went unreleased. The removed outfits were replaced with Western-exclusive outfits. Changes to content were attributed to Nintendo's varying content requirements and regulations for the regions the game was released in. Staff later defended <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> as necessary adjustments based on the regions they would be releasing the game in, while working on keeping the core identity intact. After the game's Western release, staff were divided on the issue: Yamagami was positive about the game's adaption for a Western audience, while Hirata was initially disappointed with the alterations prior to seeing positive responses to the game from Western fans. Following the game's Western release, a fan-developed patch was released that reverted all the localization changes, ranging from cosmetic alteration to script changes.|$|E

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{the number}} of front line {{infantry}} within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a manpower crisis. In an attempt to consolidate manpower and to increase {{the number of}} machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was cut from twelve to nine. This had the effect of reducing the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the 33rd Division. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time.
