5|$|Fearing that <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> {{war would}} spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian Congress criticised {{scientific}} and civil defense agencies for scaremongering, {{and the government}} and army were preoccupied with <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> campaign in Bogotá, the national capital, which was then at its height.|$|E
5|$|The Mozambican War of Independence was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> {{forces of the}} Mozambique Liberation Front or FRELIMO (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique), and Portugal. The war officially started on September 25, 1964, and ended with a ceasefire on September 8, 1974, resulting in a negotiated independence in 1975.|$|E
50|$|On April 30, 1998, <b>The</b> ELN <b>guerrilla</b> {{assaulted}} <b>the</b> Colombian {{border town}} of Ragonvalia. After <b>the</b> attacks <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> crossed <b>the</b> border into Venezuela. Venezuelan president Rafael Caldera authorized the Colombian Army to enter Venezuela and fight <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Following the 1990 Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait, SF teams {{worked with the}} Kuwaiti resistance. When they can direct, using long-distance secure communications, air and missile strikes on targets, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> need not risk their limited resources in raids and ambushes. While U.S. special operations doctrine had conceived of guiding strikes, that was seen as being done directly by SF specialists. The evolving model would have SF UW trainers teach <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> how to guide strikes against targets. Separating the means of destruction from <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> not only makes them safer, but avoids the problem of [...] "blowback" [...] if <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> later turn against the U.S.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> {{sent from}} <b>the</b> India during May-June to various sectors were ill-equipped and not {{properly}} trained and hence were unsuccessful {{in almost every}} operations. Most of <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> were caught or shot dead by Pakistani Army.|$|R
5|$|With Lord Carrington, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, in the chair, {{these discussions}} were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, {{producing}} {{a total of}} 47 plenary sessions. On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the Lancaster House Agreement, effectively ending <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Besides their guerrilla activities, {{these groups}} {{also participated in}} many pivotal battles during the liberation of the islands. In Cebu, guerrillas and irregulars under Lieutenant James M. Cushing and Basilio J. Valdes aided in the Battle for Cebu City. They were also {{successful}} in their capture of Maj. Gen. Takeo Manjom and his 2,000 soldiers and munitions. Panay guerrillas under Col. Macario Peralta helped in the seizing of the Tiring Landing Field and Mandurriao district airfield during the Battle of the Visayas. Major Ingeniero commanded <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> forces in Bohol, {{in which they were}} credited in the liberation of the island from Japanese outposts at a cost of only seven men.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long-term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> from Comas lacked weapons, {{the peasants}} being armed only with spears. The peasants arrested Salazar in early July 1882 on {{the arrival of}} two columns sent by Caceres to reorganize <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> with orders to attack Concepción.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side, {{the actions of}} the Spanish police were wearing down the {{population}} in the areas populated by <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b> Their repressive tactics ranged from searches, to the utilization of contras to uncover maquis links, to the scorched earth policy utilized in Maestrazgo. The Guardia Civil removed the population from many mountain zones where support for <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> had continued, intending to deprive <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> of this support. Torture was a common practice during interrogations.|$|R
5000|$|In total, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> {{trained and}} {{supported}} by SACO/Naval Group China had destroyed more than 200 bridges, 84 locomotives, and 141 ships and river craft. Their activities {{were responsible for the}} deaths of around 71,000 Japanese military personnel, and <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> themselves killed about 30,000- a rate of 2 1/2 Japanese for each weapon supplied to <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> by SACO. This [...] "kill ratio" [...] was unmatched by any branch of the American military during the war.|$|R
5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E
5|$|San Martín and Belgrano {{met at the}} Yatasto relay. The {{army was}} in poor condition, and San Martín {{initially}} refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it would hurt the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Martín acted as instructed. San Martín stayed {{only a few weeks}} in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> war waged by Martín Miguel de Güemes against the royalists, similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Martín trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods in more ways than one.|$|E
5000|$|Jorge Medina -a witness {{located in}} the {{basement}} {{at the start of}} the siege- said that [...] "suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> entered <b>the</b> basement in a truck. They opened fire with their machine guns against everyone who was there". [...] The official report judged that <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> planned <b>the</b> takeover operation to be a 'bloody takeover'. According to these official sources <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> [...] "set out to shoot indiscriminately and detonate building-shaking bombs while chanting M19-praising battle cries." ...|$|R
50|$|In July 1987, Jairo Jonathan Elias-Zacarias {{was arrested}} for {{illegally}} entering the United States without inspection. In deportation proceedings, he testified that six months before he was arrested, in his native Guatemala, two armed, uniformed guerrillas covering their faces with handkerchiefs entered his home. <b>The</b> armed <b>guerrillas</b> demanded {{that he and his}} parents join the rebellion, but they all refused. Elias-Zacarias did not want to join <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> because they were against the government, and he was afraid the government would retaliate against him if he joined <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b> Elias-Zacarias left Guatemala in March, 1987, because he was afraid <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> would return.|$|R
50|$|Royalists {{casualties}} were few, as <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> had withdrawn timely. <b>The</b> Hmong <b>guerrillas</b> had served {{to attract the}} concentration of Communist troops, making them a worthwhile target for tactical air power. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> withdrew to nearby Moung Hiem; this Lima Site was held by Forces Armee Neutralistes Batallion Infanterie 5 (BI 5). They had a tacit nonaggression pact with the PAVN.|$|R
5|$|Spanish Americans in royalist areas {{who were}} {{committed}} to independence had already joined <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of {{the control of the}} crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.|$|E
5|$|The duo was {{eventually}} smuggled into occupied Poland where they contacted the Polish Underground in Częstochowa and joined <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> movement Armia Krajowa. Posing as a Polish laborer {{working in a}} jam factory, he served on patrols, raided food convoys, and assassinated members of the Gestapo during a probationary period. After the camp was attacked in December, which not only killed several resistance members but also caused a split in the group, the reduced force continued its operations until February 1944, when retaliation for a raid on a police garrison lowered their membership to a critical point.|$|E
5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
5000|$|The plan {{aimed to}} defeat <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> by cutting off their {{sources of support}} from the civilians was a succeed. The {{creation}} of ‘New Village’ under this plan had caused shortages of intelligences and foods supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effects on <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Livingston {{was not to}} be eliminated, however. Further {{attempts}} to destroy his force or capture it resulted in frustration. The Union troops from the two camps, and other Union troops nearby, repeatedly forced <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> to scatter. Instead of being able to round them up, however, they found <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> would simply disappear, not to be found until they decided to attack Union troops. After the War it was discovered <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> had established a well concealed camp (Livingston's Hideout) 5½ miles east of Camp Hunter and just inside the Kansas border with Missouri.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} July, <b>the</b> Bouamlong <b>guerrillas</b> {{staged a}} diversionary attack on the Communist Route 72 supply line. However, in early August, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> were overrun by a Communist counter-assault.|$|R
5|$|Waugh {{managed to}} extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was {{recruited}} by Randolph Churchill to serve in a military mission to Yugoslavia, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from Bari, Italy, to the Croatian island of Vis. There, they met Marshal Tito, the Communist leader of the Partisans, who was leading <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.|$|E
5|$|When {{initially}} established, the F-FDTL land force comprised two light infantry battalions, {{each with}} an authorised strength of 600 personnel. Each battalion has three rifle companies, a support {{company and a}} headquarters company. Although the army is small, <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers {{and it has the}} potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion. The Army's current doctrine is focused on low-intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter-insurgency tasks. Most of the force's training and operations are conducted at the section level, and company or battalion-sized exercises are rare.|$|E
5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare {{to commemorate the}} struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid the integration of <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As President, Mugabe retained Walls {{as the head of}} the armed forces.|$|E
50|$|On February 17, 1968 five {{surviving}} guerrillas, three Cubans and two Bolivians, {{managed to}} get to Chile. There they were detained by policing carabiniers and sent to Iquique. On February 22, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> applied for asylum. While in Iquique they were visited by Salvador Allende, then {{president of the senate}} of Chile. After <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla's</b> meeting with Allende and other prominent leftist politicians the interior minister of the Christian Democrat government Edmundo Pérez Zujovic decided to expel <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> from Chile. Due to problems in obtaining transit visas the journey to Cuba was done via Tahiti and New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Livingstone {{also argues}} that the Colombian paramilitaries employ counter {{insurgency}} methods that US military schools and manuals have been teaching Latin American officers in Colombia and in the region at large since the 1960s, and that these manuals teach students to target civilian supporters of <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas,</b> because without such support <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> cannot survive.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, {{the effort}} worked to {{contaminate}} water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into Rhodesia, forcing <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled {{by the security}} forces. Finally, the Rhodesians sought to hit <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> in their camps in Mozambique by poisoning food, beverages, and medicines.|$|R
5|$|Anderson {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> camp and {{described}} the day's events, the brutality of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw {{a group of about}} 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops {{to the top of a}} hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed; Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.|$|E
5|$|In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 {{adopted by}} the Cortes de Cadiz served {{as the basis for}} {{independence}} in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> forces led by Vicente Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|Long's {{strategy}} of proclaiming {{himself as a}} royal descendent or claiming to have supernatural powers in order to rally support for political ends was not new; it has been repeatedly used throughout Vietnamese history. In 1516, a man calling himself Trần Cảo rebelled against the Lê Dynasty, claiming to be a descendant of the deposed Trần Dynasty and a reincarnation of Indra. During the 19th century, there was a Buddhist revival and many people masqueraded as monks claiming to have supernatural powers. These false monks were frequently able to start new religious movements and secret societies based on millenarianism. Quickly gathering large numbers of disciples, they staged rebellions against Vietnamese imperial and French colonial armies alike. However, these uprisings were typically incoherent and caused minimal disruption to the ruling authorities. On the other hand, the French were often troubled by resistance movements in southern Vietnam that were led by more conventionally motivated nationalist militants, such as <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla</b> outfits of Trương Định and Nguyễn Trung Trực.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{communication}} between the Sector Commanders and the Indian Military Officers also created major casualties to <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> sent by <b>the</b> Indian officers to Bangladesh. Wherever <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> were caught or killed, Pakistani Army {{in search of the}} other members of them used to start arson in many villages and killed numerous innocent people to take revenge.|$|R
50|$|Without Bunke as <b>the</b> <b>guerrilla's</b> contact to <b>the</b> outside world, <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> {{then found}} {{themselves}} isolated. Bunke also soon found herself battling a high fever, a leg injury, and the painful {{effects of the}} Chigoe flea parasite. Consequently, Guevara {{decided to try to}} send a group of 16 other ailing combatants, including Bunke, out of the mountains.|$|R
2500|$|... "The hammer blows of <b>the</b> <b>guerrillas</b> {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> British administration. <b>The</b> <b>guerrillas</b> {{acted in}} small {{numbers in the}} right localities and compelled the British to disperse to find them. Then as the British searched, they hit them at will {{by means of the}} ambush. Communications were systematically destroyed and even the British army's transport system in the country was disorganised." ...|$|R
