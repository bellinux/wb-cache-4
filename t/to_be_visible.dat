5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and {{found it to be}} a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> with the naked eye. He {{observed the}} double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.|$|E

5|$|In November 1943 some {{plutonium}} trifluoride {{was reduced}} to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads. Enough plutonium was produced {{to make it the}} first synthetically made element <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> with the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This is bright enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> using a high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> without special processing.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E

5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E

5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>visible</b> through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E
