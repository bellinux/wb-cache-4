25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{shortage}} of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 {{percent of the time}} to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula was devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.|$|E

Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable.

25|$|CTR as {{pedagogy}} {{has been}} almost universally employed by schools {{since its inception in}} the late nineteenth century, and until the 1960s, its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product and the notion that <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and cognitivism.|$|E

At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. The young Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be [...] "bored" [...] by his studies. He was quoted later as saying: [...] "I never learned much geography at school...

Reviewers {{also pointed out that}} Zhang had succeeded in breaking away from the [...] "commercial entertainment wave" [...] of popular film. Noel Vera of BusinessWorld writes that the film concerns itself mainly with emotional impact, at the expense of visual extravagance, making it the opposite of earlier Zhang Yimou films such as Red Sorghum. Other critics noted the strength of the film's storytelling; for instance, Rainer called the film an [...] "uncommon, and uncommonly moving, love story", and Film Journal Internationals Kevin Lally described it as [...] "a poignant story of poverty and spirit reminiscent of the great Italian neo-realists." [...] Another well-received part of the film was the segment in which Wei teaches math by creating practical examples out of her attempt {{to raise money for the}} bus to Zhangjiakou; in the Chinese journal Teacher Doctrines, Mao Wen wrote that <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> learn from Wei's example and provide students with practical exercises.|$|E

The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives.

Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities".

[...] He praised Hugo Black's dissenting opinion on Tinker and called it [...] "prophetic". Thomas cited the doctrine of in loco parentis, meaning [...] "in place of the parent", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. [...] "In short", he continues, [...] "in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed." [...] He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted Tinker for [...] "usurping [...] traditional authority for the judiciary".

2500|$|Benjamin Bloom (1913â€“1999) {{spent over}} 50 {{years at the}} University of Chicago, where {{he worked in the}} {{department}} of education. He believed that all students can learn. He developed taxonomy of educational objectives. The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think. It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex. The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. [...] The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories. The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values. The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex. The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination. The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives {{that could be used to}} help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy. [...] The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material. Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses. Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.|$|E
