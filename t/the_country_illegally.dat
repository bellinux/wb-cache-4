5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. People {{have been moving}} {{throughout}} history. These movements may be either obligatory due to natural disasters, wars and famines or voluntary such as the movements to find more fertile lands or new jobs. The movements {{of people have been}} limited by the immigration policies of receiving countries. Although developed countries are willing to accept migrant workers in economic boom years, they do their best to limit their entrance in stagnation periods. As a last resort, people use the deficiencies in legal and physical measures to enter <b>the</b> destination <b>countries</b> <b>illegally.</b> These people are mostly employed in the jobs shunned by the natives and therefore they are still welcomed implicitly. Receiving states try to prevent illegal immigration waves as they are seen {{as a threat to the}} sovereignty, and more recently, the security of the states. This thesis analyzes the measures to be taken in prevention of illegal migration and tries to bring new solutions to the problem. İşaşır, EmirM. S...|$|R
3000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, a registry-based {{random sample}} has limitations {{that are relevant}} for {{the selection of the}} migrant population. For example, persons who have recently moved and have not yet registered at their new place of residence cannot be covered by the register. This is particularly relevant for migrants in Germany, {{who are most likely to}} be unfamiliar with the practice of registration (Salentin 2014). In certain circumstances, moves from one municipality to another are reported only with considerable delay, or only if proof of current residence is required for other purposes. In addition, some migrants fail to deregister with their local registration office when they permanently return to their country of origin. In consequence, in some cases, the addresses of selected individuals are no longer current (Martin et al. 2015). Moreover, migrants may be residing in <b>the</b> host <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> According to an estimate provided by the Hamburgisches Weltwirtschaftsinstitut (2010), 3 the proportion of illegal immigrants in the target population in Germany at the time of sample selection in PIAAC Germany was approximately [...]. 5 %. However, this figure is subject to change due the current refugee movements.|$|R

25|$|In 1986, Turkish {{soldiers}} and Greek soldiers sufferd casualties at the Evros River incident, due to fire exchange. Turkish and Greek soldiers have exchanged {{fire in the}} past, as Greeks have tried to stop Iranian refugees from entering <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> from Turkey, but this incident {{was the first in}} which there have been casualties. During this period, Greek soldiers along the border with Turkey were on alert after receiving reports that Turkey planned to help thousands of refugees slip into Greece illegally.|$|E
25|$|The law prohibits {{all forms}} of {{trafficking}} in persons; however, {{there were reports that}} persons were trafficked to, from, through, and within <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Women from Russia, other <b>countries</b> of <b>the</b> former Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries were trafficked to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. They were recruited personally or answered advertisements and were flown to Korea, often with entertainer or tourist visas. In some instances, once these visa recipients arrived in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> employers <b>illegally</b> held victims' passports. In addition some foreign women recruited for legal and brokered marriages with Korean men ended up in situations of sexual exploitation, debt bondage, and involuntary servitude once married. Korean women were trafficked primarily for sexual exploitation to the United States, sometimes through Canada and Mexico, as well as to other countries, such as Australia and Japan. Relatively small numbers of migrants seeking opportunities in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> were believed to have become victims of trafficking as well, although the MOL Employment Permit System reduced the number of workers trafficked into <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> There were reports that human traffickers exploited ROK passports for the purpose of human trafficking. There was no credible evidence that officials were involved in trafficking.|$|R
2500|$|The {{deportation}} of Georgian {{immigrants from}} Russia amid the ongoing diplomatic crisis also aroused much controversy. According to Russian authorities, {{more than half}} of the Georgians in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> are working <b>illegally.</b> Following the Russian crackdown on Georgian-owned alleged criminal businesses and the tightening of visa criteria for Georgians, on October 6, 2006, about 136 Georgians accused of [...] "immigration offences" [...] were flown back to Georgia on board a Russian cargo plane. Several deportees, however, showed valid passports and Russian entry visas, as reported by Reuters. In Georgia, the process of deportation and crackdown on allegedly illegal Georgian businesses in Moscow was described as “ethnic cleansing.” ...|$|R
40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is a {{multilateral}} international treaty designed to effectively govern {{the return of}} children abducted (often by a parent) and taken to a foreign country. In most cases, if the “left-behind” parent applies for relief under the Convention {{within a year of}} the abduction, the child must be returned to <b>the</b> <b>country</b> of origin for a custody hearing. If, however, the application for return is made more than one year after abduction and the child is now “well-settled” in their new environment, the application may be denied under the well-settled affirmative defense provided by Article 12 of the Convention. The Convention does not, however, specify which factors are to be considered in a well-settled determination, and courts have frequently grappled with how immigration status (particularly, whether the abducting parent and child are living in <b>the</b> new <b>country</b> <b>illegally)</b> should impact <b>the</b> determination. U. S. and international courts have adopted one of three approaches to the issue: granting immigration status considerable weight in the determination, treating immigration status as {{one of a number of}} equally weighted factors in the determination, or granting immigration status considerably little weight in the determination. This Note addresses this conflict and concludes that courts should generally accord immigration status little weight, except where uncertain immigration status is likely to affect the child’s future prospects, irrespective of a deportation risk...|$|R
25|$|On 26 August, {{two days}} before the UNSC meeting and Frazer was due to arrive in Khartoum, Paul Salopek, a U.S. National Geographic Magazine journalist, {{appeared}} in court in Darfur facing charges of espionage; he had crossed into <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> from Chad, circumventing the Sudanese government's official restrictions on foreign journalists. He was later released after direct negotiation with President al-Bashir. This came a month after Tomo Križnar, a Slovenian presidential envoy, was sentenced to two years in prison for spying.|$|E
25|$|When {{his term}} as Sheriff ended, he bought {{and ran the}} Palace Hotel and the Occidental Hotel. In 1884, he opened a store until 1887 when he was once again {{appointed}} deputy sheriff under Sheriff Eugene O. Shaw. He was deputy sheriff until January 1, 1889. On February 22, 1888, Shibell along with U.S. Deputy Marshal William K. Meade and deputies pursued men suspected of robbing a Southern Pacific train deep into Mexico. When they finally notified Mexican authorities of their purpose in Mexico, they were arrested for entering <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ineffectiveness}} {{of current}} employer sanctions for illegal hiring. This allows immigrants {{who are in}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> to easily find jobs. There are three reasons for this ineffectiveness—the absence of reliable mechanisms for verifying employment eligibility, inadequate funding of interior immigration enforcement, {{and the absence of}} political will due to labor needs to the United States economy. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant, but according to Judith Gans, there are no reliable mechanisms in place for employers to verify that the immigrants' papers are authentic.|$|E
30|$|It is also {{necessary}} to weigh up the security of immigrants themselves, especially {{when they try to}} enter <b>the</b> host <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> because of human trafficking networks (Czaika & de Haas, 2013), that have caused the loss of human lives, notably in routes from North Africa to Southern European countries and, more recently, related to the Syrian civil war (Ferreira, 2016 a, pp. 1 – 2). Nevertheless, even if they settle in, some reports indicate cases of illegal work, work exploitation, involvement in prostitution and human organ trafficking networks (Burgess, 2011, p. 15), which generate a space for the legal marginalisation of (im)migrants based on the of use nationalistic values to justify the exclusion of immigrants (Geddes, 2003, p. 22). For the benefit of immigrants and hosting communities, prevention of marginalisation, discrimination, urban segregation and social disruption are essential to ensure social stability. If economic and social security of these individuals is granted, the area of socio-economic exclusion will be restricted. However, so far, the path followed does not seem very inclusive, as some countries in global North rely on growing punitive governance, which clearly illustrates the cycle of labour marginalisation, radicalisation and criminalisation. The politics of immigration control and the criminalization of illegal immigrants derive mostly from a social-legal system that allow their marginalization and their labour exploitation (Melossi, 2015, p. 60, p. 85).|$|R

5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> supplying food <b>illegally</b> at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|R

His father had come to the United States without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector.
