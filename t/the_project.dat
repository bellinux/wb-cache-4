In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was publicly closed after Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games for trademark and copyright infringement. Despite its closure, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> has received critical and popular praise.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>project</b> made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E

Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted <b>the</b> <b>project</b> placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed <b>the</b> <b>project</b> that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E

In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> and restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand <b>the</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for <b>the</b> <b>project</b> were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong opposition to <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> This opposition came first from engineers {{who felt that}} the covering was incompatible with Brusselsâ€™s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to <b>the</b> <b>project</b> complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> This resulted in several transfers of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens assumed <b>the</b> <b>project</b> leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left <b>the</b> <b>project</b> in 1998.|$|E
