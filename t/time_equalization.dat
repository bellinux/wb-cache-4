30|$|This paper {{proposed}} the <b>time</b> domain <b>equalization</b> (TDE) method for the TS-OFDM signal in higher time-varying fading channels. The salient {{features of the}} proposed method are to employ the new design of TS signal in the estimation of CIR at every sampling time and the <b>time</b> domain <b>equalization</b> method of using the parallel block inverse matrix algorithm. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed TDE method, this paper conducted various computer simulations. From the simulation results, this paper confirmed that the proposed TS signal can achieve lower leakage of power spectrum density at the outside of allocated OFDM frequency bandwidth with keeping higher CIR estimation accuracy. This paper also concluded that the proposed TDE method with the parallel block inverse matrix algorithm can achieve much better BER performance than the conventional FDE methods of using the complexity reduction methods with allowable increase of computation complexity in higher time-varying fading channels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — OFDM systems {{typically}} {{make use}} of a cyclic prefix to combat multipath fading. Although computationally cheap, this solution also reduces the channel efficiency. <b>Time</b> <b>equalization</b> is one alternative to add multipath robustness and achieve a better data rate. In this article, we introduce a time equalizer suitable for use in OFDM systems that employ pilot carriers for channel estimation, {{as in the case}} of the European DVB-T and the Japanese ISDB-T. The novelty presented is a new variant of the LMS algorithm specially adapted for OFDM systems. We show with simulations that the introduction of the pre-FFT time equalizer increases the performance of the DVB-T system. The proposed algorithm does not depend on the cyclic prefix length and can even be used in systems that do not use one. The resulting complexity of the adaptation algorithm is within the capabilities of current technology. Index Terms — DVB-T, OFDM, Pre-FFT equalization, time equalizer. I...|$|E
30|$|In OFDM, {{as long as}} {{the channel}} delay spread and the {{possible}} synchronization errors remain within the cyclic prefix <b>time,</b> <b>equalization</b> can simply be done with a complex coefficient multiplication at subcarrier level. This approach is also applicable to FBMC, if the ratio of channel delay spread in samples and number of subchannels is sufficiently low, since the frequency variation within a subchannel is then small enough that it can be considered flat fading. But as this is not the general case, more effective channel equalization methods have been developed for FBMC. The single complex coefficient is usually considered when the FB waveforms are well localized in time and frequency domains to limit the effect on consecutive symbols and neighboring subchannels [5, 29, 30]. Longer finite impulse response (FIR) filters as subcarrier equalizers with cross-connections between the adjacent subchannels to cancel the ICI are studied in [31, 32]. To avoid the cross-connections between subchannels, an oversampled receiver filter bank structure with per-subcarrier FIR equalizers can restore the orthogonality of the subcarrier waveforms. This approach is followed in [33 – 37] and more recently with MMSE equalizers explicitly for FBMC/OQAM in [38].|$|E
