Relying to a considerable degree on the analysis of factors determining the achievement of Hattie's students, Leithwood et al. (2009) identified four paths allowing a head teacher to exert impact on students' learning processes through his/her actions. They are <b>the</b> rational <b>path,</b> <b>the</b> emotions <b>path,</b> <b>the</b> organisation <b>path,</b> and <b>the</b> family <b>path.</b> <b>The</b> objective of the research was {{to answer the following}} question: which tasks in the area of teaching and learning activities do head teachers consider as the most important? Preparing an answer to this question, the author relied on data collected during in-depth interviews (IDI) with 170 head teachers of Polish schools. The interviews were conducted within the scope of the project entitled Educational Leadership, whose objective is to prepare a training and development system for head teachers. Opinions acquired during the interviews underwent a qualitative analysis (an analysis of the content) in an attempt to isolate particular activities undertaken by head teachers with respect to <b>the</b> four <b>paths</b> of influencing students' learning processes: <b>the</b> rational <b>path,</b> <b>the</b> emotions <b>path,</b> <b>the</b> organisation <b>path,</b> and <b>the</b> family <b>path...</b>|$|R
