5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled {{the ball on the}} second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> took less than a minute of game time to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E

50|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1989 regular season {{to get himself}} more {{established}} at his full-time job, Mullen signed with <b>the</b> Detroit <b>Drive</b> during their playoff run. <b>The</b> <b>Drive</b> won ArenaBowl III. Mullen returned to <b>the</b> <b>Drive</b> in 1991, and teamed with fellow WR/DB George LaFrance and QB Art Schlichter, <b>the</b> <b>Drive's</b> offense stood {{as one of the}} most challenging to defend. He helped <b>the</b> <b>Drive</b> to a three-peat with a 37-yard touchdown reception, when <b>the</b> <b>Drive</b> defeated <b>the</b> Dallas Texans 51-27 in ArenaBowl IV. In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Drive</b> were again on their way to the ArenaBowl, this time they faced the Orlando Predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} freewheel device {{consists of}} two saw-toothed, spring-loaded discs pressing against each other with the toothed sides together, somewhat like a ratchet. Rotating in one direction, the saw teeth of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> disc lock with the teeth of <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> disc, making it rotate at the same speed. If <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> disc slows down or stops rotating, the teeth of <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> disc slip over <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> disc teeth and continue rotating, producing a characteristic clicking sound proportionate to the speed difference of <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> gear relative {{to that of the}} (slower) driving gear.|$|R
25|$|When using {{hardware}} RAID, {{the controller}} usually adds controller-dependent data to <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> which prevents software RAID from accessing the user data. While {{it is possible}} to read the data with a compatible hardware RAID controller, this inconveniences consumers as a compatible controller usually isn't readily available. Using the JBOD/RAID-Z combination, any disk controller can be used to resume operation after a controller failure.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{used with}} multiple-user {{computers}} running enterprise software. Examples are: transaction processing databases, internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce), scientific computing software, and nearline storage management software. Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously ("24/7") in demanding environments while delivering {{the highest possible}} performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.|$|E
25|$|On one of <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> {{along the}} coast, Master (Yogananda) {{spoke to me}} about the value of SRF Colonies. He {{referred}} to the forming of groups within a city or a rural area in the manner of hermitage life, among members who do not desire to become renunciants, or cannot do so because of certain obligations. Such a life would enable each one to be in daily association with those who share the same spiritual goal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{value-added}} resellers are {{now using}} a flash drive as part of small-business turnkey solutions (e.g., point-of-sale systems). <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> {{is used as a}} backup medium: at the close of business each night, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> is inserted, and a database backup is saved to <b>the</b> <b>drive.</b> Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> is removed at night and taken offsite.|$|R
50|$|There are 13 known {{different}} US {{versions of}} the VertiBird playsets. The original VertiBird had an early manufacturing change that modified <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> spring to <b>drive</b> rod coupling. <b>The</b> first version had the end of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> rod screwed into <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> spring on <b>the</b> helicopter. The production modification resulted in <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> rod being permanently soldered to <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> spring, and packaged the base, controls, rods, and helicopter (except rotor) into one complete unit.|$|R

25|$|Nine bond drives were {{conducted}} over {{the length of}} the war and, as in Austria-Hungary, the loans were issued at six-month intervals. <b>The</b> <b>drives</b> themselves would often last several weeks, during which there was extensive use of propaganda via all possible media. Most bonds had a rate of return of 5% and were redeemable over a ten-year period, in semi-annual payments. Like war bonds in other countries, the German war bonds drives were designed to be extravagant displays of patriotism and the bonds were sold through banks, post offices and other financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|E-waste {{presents}} a potential security threat {{to individuals and}} exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. Credit card numbers, private financial data, account information, and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> for information to use in local scams. Electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security {{institutions such as the}} Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Transportation Security Administration, and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.|$|E
500|$|The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three {{modes of}} drive {{operation}} were automatic, local, and manual. In automatic, <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> {{would follow the}} bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system. In local, <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> would follow {{the motion of the}} trainer's and pointer's hand wheels. [...] (This is similar to power steering on a car.) [...] Manual was direct gear linkage from the hand wheels to move the mount with no power assist.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{relies on}} measuring several key (mainly mechanical) parameters of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> unit, {{for example the}} flying height of heads. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> firmware compares <b>the</b> measured parameters against predefined thresholds and evaluates the health status of <b>the</b> <b>drive.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> appears likely to fail soon, the system sends notification to the disk controller.|$|R
50|$|The {{lubricator}} is {{a self-contained}} unit with <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism fitted at one end, with <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> shaft {{running through the}} cast iron oil reservoir. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> shaft is fitted with 2 hardened steel eccentrics which provide movement to <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> frame which runs in machined grooves in the oil reservoir. This drive frame reciprocates vertically which then <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> double acting independent oil pumps located in the oil reservoir.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{models were}} {{produced}} both powered by J.A.P air-cooled V-twin engines with friction disc transmission and belt <b>drive.</b> <b>The</b> friction <b>drive</b> {{consisted of a}} vertical driven disc and a smaller wheel which could be moved {{across the face of}} <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> disc so <b>the</b> distace from <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> axis would give variable gearing. A clutch action was made by lifting <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> wheel off <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> disc. Moving <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> wheel past <b>the</b> centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9hp engine.|$|R
500|$|The {{optical system}} weighs [...] and is manoeuvred on an alt-azimuth mount, {{with a total}} moving mass of [...] (plus instruments). The BTA-6 and Multi Mirror Telescope had {{demonstrated}} during the 1970s the significant weight (and therefore cost) savings which could be achieved by the alt-azimuth design compared to the traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes. However, the alt-azimuth design requires continuous computer control, compensation for field rotation at each focus, and results in a 0.2 degree radius [...] at zenith where the drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion (<b>the</b> <b>drives</b> have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis). The mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before the drive motors were installed {{it was possible to}} move the then [...] assembly by hand. During closed loop guiding, the mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0.03 arcseconds.|$|E
500|$|Part of this promotional {{campaign}} involved USB drives {{that were left}} in concert venues for fans to find during Nine Inch Nails' 2007 European tour.

500|$|At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat, and {{contemporary}} sources indicate his performance improved. [...] "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle {{field for the}} Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. [...] "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added. [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> was for a home run {{and three of the}} hits were bunts". [...] In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] The Vindicator went on to quote the Indianapolis Journal as follows: [...] "Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. [...] He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal". [...] The article concluded, [...] "If he keeps up this gait, it will not be long before [...] Von der Ahe reclaims his pet".|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>drives</b> {{are closely}} related to desire since both {{originate}} in the field of the subject. But they are not to be confused: drives are the partial aspects in which desire is realized—desire is one and undivided, whereas <b>the</b> <b>drives</b> are its partial manifestations. A drive is a demand that is not caught up in the dialectical mediation of desire; drive is a [...] "mechanical" [...] insistence that is not ensnared in demand's dialectical mediation.|$|E
