5|$|Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who {{resided in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and {{a veteran of}} the Alps, made the first attempt to ascend the {{mountain}} in 1866.

5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E

5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back,</b> while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} abandon the attack.|$|E
5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up {{to buy one}} of his own, but because of his poor credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's suggestion <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice.

5|$|In 1869, Ontario Member of Parliament William McDougall was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories and sent to Fort Garry to establish formal governance for Canada. Before his party arrived at the settlement, a small group led by Louis Riel intercepted him near the Ontario border and forced him <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> because they opposed the transfer to the Canadian government. The inhabitants of the Red River Valley began the Red River Rebellion, delaying formal governance until their demands for provincial status were met.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> {{the same way they}} had come with only four men surviving.|$|E

5|$|Relief efforts {{following}} the hurricane were mostly {{affected by the}} associated flooding. Trucks transporting food and medicine from the Jalisco state government were forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> because of flooded roads. The army then decided on an aerial transport. This effort was hampered because, after three federal helicopters and Air Force planes touched down at the local airport, the road into the city was still flooded, meaning the aid could not be distributed.|$|E
5|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P.

5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington and they had <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York {{and then on to}} Albany and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

25|$|Thus began Australia's {{involvement}} in the six-year global conflict.

From bomber missions over Europe and Mediterranean naval engagements, to facing Japanese mini-sub raids on Sydney Harbour and devastating air raids on the city of Darwin.|$|R

5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored an order <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation {{and shot the}} attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by European standards.|$|E
