25|$|In the United States, {{the tax on}} {{interest}} income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, {{in some cases the}} benefit derived from <b>tax</b> <b>deferral</b> may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{insurance}} products and practices {{have been described}} as rent-seeking by critics. That is, some {{insurance products}} or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this <b>tax</b> <b>deferral</b> is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{possibility}} of having a [...] "retirement" [...] became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly {{should not have to}} work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintain an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained to have employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by collective agreement became known as [...] "Taft-Hartley plans" [...] after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required joint management of funds by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual [...] "401(k)" [...] plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same <b>tax</b> <b>deferral</b> rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a [...] "defined benefit" [...] plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have to rely only on minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. There is no right to an occupational pension, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other [...] "employee benefit" [...] plan.|$|E

40|$|Three {{hypotheses}} {{about the nature}} of federal tax arrears in Russia {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s are tested empirically. Tax arrears can be a result of: 1) liquidity problems in firms, 2) redistribute subsidies of the federal government, or 3) regional political resistance to federal tax collectors. Liquidity problems in firms explain a large part of variation in tax arrears. Regional political resistance to federal tax collectors was also an important factor: for a given level of liquidity, federal arrears accumulated faster in regions where governors had a larger popular base, regions with better bargaining position vis-à-vis the centre, and regions with governors in political opposition to the centre. We find that patterns of federal arrears are inconsistent with the redistributive politics premise that redistribution favours jurisdictions with ‘closer races’ for the incumbent in national elections. Variation in authorized <b>tax</b> <b>deferrals,</b> in part, can be explained by federal redistributive politics. redistributive politics; regional protection; Russia; tax arrears; transition...|$|R

(JEL G 11) Tax-deferred retirement accounts have grown considerably in popularity in recent years. An investor with significant wealth in both his taxable and tax-deferred accounts faces both the traditional asset allocation decision (how much to allocate to each asset) and a location decision (where to place an asset). When dealing with each account in isolation, the investor’s desired allocation is generally different across the two accounts, as he prefers different portfolios under different tax environments. 1 Integrating the two portfolio decisions is clearly important and, not surprisingly, complex, given the potential interactions between these decisions and tax considerations. 2 This paper seeks to shed ligh...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. In the Introduction to this study, two {{potential}} {{measures of}} effectiveness of {{controlled foreign company}} (hereinafter “CFC”) rules (as anti-avoidance legislation) are identified, namely {{the extent to which}} <b>tax</b> avoidance or <b>deferral</b> is prevented, {{and the extent to which}} those business undertakings and investments for which <b>tax</b> avoidance or <b>deferral</b> is not the sole or main purpose or effect are complicated or subjected to disincentives, with the focus of the study being on the latter. Section 9 D of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (South Africa: 2012 a), (hereinafter “the Act”, to which all otherwise un-referenced section references also refer) operates within the context of the worldwide basis of taxation adopted by South Africa and its related provisions. The study of the fundamentals of section 9 D demonstrates that residents who, alone or together with one or more “connected persons”, invest in “foreign companies” which meet the definition of a “controlled foreign company” in section 9 D(1), and who meet the minimum holding requirement of at least 10 % of either participation rights or voting rights (proviso (A) to section 9 D(2)), are subjected to the inclusion in their income for tax purposes of a notional amount equal to their proportion of participation rights in the CFC applied to the CFC’s net income (section 9 D(2)), unless any exemption or exclusion from the provisions of section 9 D of the Act applies. A foreign company meets the CFC definition (subject to provisos) if residents “directly or indirectly” hold over 50 % of participation rights or voting rights. The legislature is understood to have intended this section as both an anti-deferral and anti-avoidance measure regarding income tax, within the context of the intention of the legislature to tax South African residents on a worldwide basis. Relief is provided where limitations in the jurisdiction of residence of a CFC would inhibit the funding of a resident’s tax liability by way of CFC dividends (section 9 A), however not when such dividends are not forthcoming for other reasons. The study highlights in a number of areas that when section 9 D of the Act is measured against the extent to which business is complicated or subjected to disincentives, it may fall short in that the section is found to both introduce considerable complexity, and to contain a number of uncertainties and potential pitfalls which may introduce risk and compliance cost for resident investors in CFCs. The section appears however to be effective in its prevention of avoidance or <b>deferral</b> of <b>tax,</b> which is its main purpose, although it is submitted that the section does have wider implications for resident taxpayers. Further legislative focus appears to be warranted with a view to alleviating those impacts which may be undesirable from a policy point of view. Negative impacts may include potential reduced after-tax investment returns; increased taxation uncertainty; increased administrative costs; and increased requirements for scarce business resources...|$|R
