Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino-terminal <b>threonine</b> of catalytic β subunits of the proteasome, particularly the β5 subunit responsible for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity.

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic assembly/disassembly of non-muscle myosin II {{filaments}} {{is critical}} for the regulation of enzymatic activities and localization. Phosphorylation of three <b>threonines,</b> 1823, 1833 and 2029, in the tail of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II has been implicated in control of myosin filament assembly. By systematically replacing the three <b>threonines</b> to aspartates, mimicking a phosphorylated residue, we found that position 1823 is the most critical one for the regulation of myosin filament formation and in vivo function. Surprisingly, a single charge change is able to perturb filament formation and in vivo function of myosin II...|$|R

5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, <b>threonine</b> proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of <b>threonine,</b> however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, <b>threonine,</b> or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. <b>Threonine</b> proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E

40|$|AFX is a Forkhead {{transcription}} factor that induces a G 1 cell cycle arrest via upregulation {{of the cell}} cycle inhibitor p 27 Kip 1. Previously we have shown that protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylates AFX causing inhibition of AFX by nuclear exclusion. In addition, Ras, through the activation of the RalGEF-Ral pathway, induces phosphorylation of AFX. Here we show that the Ras-Ral pathway provokes phosphorylation of <b>threonines</b> 447 and 451 in the C terminus of AFX. A mutant protein in which both <b>threonines</b> are substituted for alanines (T 447 A/T 451 A) still responds to PKB-regulated nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, but transcriptional activity and consequent G 1 cell cycle arrest are greatly impaired. Furthermore, inhibition of the Ral signaling pathway abolishes both AFX-mediated transcription and regulation of p 27 Kip 1, while activation of Ral augments AFX activity. From these results we conclude that Ral-mediated phosphorylation of <b>threonines</b> 447 and 451 is required for proper activity of AFX-WT. Interestingly, the T 447 A/T 451 A mutation {{did not affect the}} induction of transcription and G 1 cell cycle arrest by the PKB-insensitive AFX-A 3 mutant, suggesting that Ral-mediated phosphorylation plays a role in the regulation of AFX by PKB...|$|R
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally <b>threonine.</b> Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, <b>threonine,</b> and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino acids from the diet.

Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and <b>threonine</b> from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 2500 – 2504] inactivated the phosphatase with 32 P-labelled myelin basic protein prepared by incubation with the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, the src-family protein kinases p 56 lck and p 60 c-src, myelin basic protein kinase- 1, or protamine kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, p 56 lck and p 60 c-src phosphorylated myelin basic protein on tyrosines, that the protamine kinase phosphorylated myelin basic protein on serines, and that myelin basic protein kinase- 1 phosphorylated myelin basic protein on <b>threonines.</b> The results demonstrate that the autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase not only inactivates the protein serine/threonine phosphatase, but also the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP 2 A. This autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase-mediated inactivation of PP 2 A may, in response to extracellular stimuli, not only contribute to the enhanced phosphorylation of cellular proteins on serines and <b>threonines</b> but also on tyrosines...|$|R

Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was <b>threonine</b> in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or <b>threonine</b> residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive <b>threonine</b> hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lantibiotics are (methyl) lanthionine-containing {{bacterial}} peptides. (Methyl) lanthionines are posttranslationally {{introduced into}} the prepropeptides by biosynthetic enzymes that dehydrate serines and <b>threonines</b> and couple these dehydrated residues to cysteine residues. Thirty seven lantibiotic primary structures have been proposed to date, but {{little is known about}} the substrate specificity of the lantibiotic modifying enzymes. To define rules for the rational design of modified peptides, we compared all known lantibiotic structures by in silico analysis. Although no strict sequence motifs can be defined that govern the modification, statistical analysis demonstrates that dehydratable serines and <b>threonines</b> are more often flanked by hydrophobic than by hydrophilic amino acids. Serine residues escape dehydration more often than <b>threonines.</b> With these rules, novel hexapeptides were designed that either were predicted to become modified or will escape modification. The hexapeptides were fused to the nisin leader and expressed in a Lactococcus lactis strain containing the nisin modifying and export enzymes. The excreted peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. All designed fusion peptides were produced, and the presence or absence of modifications was found to be in full agreement with the predictions based on the statistical analysis. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of the rational design of a wide range of novel peptides with dehydrated amino acid residues...|$|R

5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, <b>threonine,</b> serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E

40|$|Small {{and large}} scale proteomic {{technologies}} are providing {{a wealth of}} potential interactions between proteins bearing phospho-recognition modules and their substrates. Resulting interaction maps reveal such a dense network of interactions that the functional dissection and understanding of these networks often require to break specific interactions while keeping the rest intact. Here, we developed a computational strategy, called STRIP, to predict the precise interaction site involved in an interaction with a phospho-recognition module. The method was validated by a two-hybrid screen carried out using the ForkHead Associated (FHA) 1 domain of Rad 53, a key protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA checkpoint, as a bait. In this screen we detected 11 partners, including Cdc 7 and Cdc 45, essential components of the DNA replication machinery. FHA domains are phospho-threonine binding modules and the <b>threonines</b> involved in both interactions could be predicted using the STRIP strategy. The <b>threonines</b> T 484 and T 189 in Cdc 7 and Cdc 45, respectively, were mutated and loss of binding could be monitored experimentally with the full-length proteins. The method was further tested {{for the analysis of}} 63 known Rad 53 binding partners and provided several key insights regarding the <b>threonines</b> likely involved in these interactions.

50|$|O-GlcNAc {{is added}} to serines or <b>threonines</b> by O-GlcNAc {{transferase}} (OGT). O-GlcNAc appears to occur on most serines and <b>threonines</b> {{that would otherwise be}} phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases. Thus, if phosphorylation occurs, O-GlcNAc does not, and vice versa. This apparently competitive modification of certain sites may have significant consequences for some research directions. Much cancer research is focused on phosphorylation, because of its important role in cell signalling pathways. As competitive or variable glycosylation occurs at the same sites, there is a risk that phosphorylation research has overlooked important roles that these modification sites play when glycosylated. O-GlcNAc addition and removal also appears to be a key regulator of the pathways that are disrupted in diabetes mellitus. The gene encoding the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) enzyme has been linked to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. It is the terminal step in a nutrient-sensing hexosamine signaling pathway.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism underlying the modulation of the cardiac L-type Ca 2 + current by protein kinase C (PKC). Using the patch-clamp technique, we found that PKC activation by 4 -α-phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) or rac- 1 -oleyl- 2 -acetylglycerol (OAG) caused a substantial reduction in Ba 2 + current through Cav 1. 2 channels composed of α 11. 2, β 1 b, and α 2 δ 1 subunits expressed in tsA- 201 cells. In contrast, Ba 2 + current through a cloned brain isoform of the Cav 1. 2 channel (rbC-II) was unaffected by PKC activation. Two potential sites of PKC phosphorylation are present at positions 27 and 31 in the cardiac form of Cav 1. 2, {{but not in the}} brain form. Deletion of N-terminal residues 2 – 46 prevented PKC inhibition. Conversion of the <b>threonines</b> at positions 27 and 31 to alanine also abolished the PKC sensitivity of Cav 1. 2. Mutant Cav 1. 2 channels in which the <b>threonines</b> were converted singly to alanines were also insensitive to PKC modulation, suggesting that phosphorylation of both residues is required for PKC-dependent modulation. Consistent with this, mutating each of the <b>threonines</b> individually to aspartate in separate mutants restored the PKC sensitivity of Cav 1. 2, indicating that a change in net charge by phosphorylation of both sites is responsible for inhibition.
