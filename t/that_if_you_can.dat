500|$|As author Malcolm Gladwell has stated, [...] "Sesame Street {{was built}} around a single, {{breakthrough}} insight: <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hold the attention of children, you can educate them". Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. Sesame Street was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, [...] "small but critical adjustments" [...] to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, Sesame Street {{was one of the}} few children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from formative and summative research.|$|E
500|$|Rufus has {{received}} mixed to positive reception since his debut. GameDaily named Rufus the strangest {{of the new}} characters introduced in Street Fighter IV, placing him 12th on their [...] "Most Bizarre Fighting Characters" [...] list and noting his high attack speed despite his weight. IGN described Rufus {{as one of the}} most interesting new characters introduced in the title, due to the [...] "juxtaposition between his comical size and impressive speed" [...] and added that his attack set [...] "shows <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get past Rufus' comical exterior, a capable fighter hides within." [...] IGN AU stated that while they felt the character was the ugliest in the game, they enjoyed his unpredictability and acrobatics, as well as his attitude. 1UP.com called Rufus a worthy addition to the series, [...] "despite...outward, me-too appearances". Anime News Network described Rufus as well-designed and engaging, despite initial reservations regarding the character. VideoGamer.com praised Rufus as one of the game's better new characters in the title, in heavy contrast to other additions such as Crimson Viper. GameTrailers praised the character and noted he [...] "definitely offered something different", adding [...] "You may not have expected a game's most obvious jiggle physics to apply to a male character." [...] Stars and Stripes noted the level of detail in Rufus's animations and movements, describing his mobility as [...] "weirdly awesome".|$|E

2500|$|There is also {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{influence}} of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. [...] "The worry is <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" [...] said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at UEA and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught {{me is that the}} NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

2500|$|At St Peter's, Connolly {{decided he}} wanted to make people laugh. [...] "I can {{remember}} the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. And I was sitting in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn't all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it longer than I normally would because I really enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn't something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant." [...] While at St Peter's, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.|$|E
2500|$|Snow shoeing â€“ A snowshoe is {{footwear}} {{for walking}} over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing {{the weight of}} the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called [...] "flotation". It is often said by snowshoers <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> walk, you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing [...] "straddle-gait" [...] that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.|$|E
2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E
