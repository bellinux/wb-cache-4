50|$|Offset binary may be {{converted}} into <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> by inverting the most significant bit. For example, with 8-bit values, the offset binary value may be XORed with 0x80 in order to convert to <b>twos</b> <b>complement.</b> In specialised hardware it may be simpler to accept the bit as it stands, but to apply its value in inverted significance.|$|E

2500|$|The term <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> {{can mean}} either a number format or a {{mathematical}} operator.

The statement [...] "convert [...] to two's complement" [...] may be ambiguous, since it could describe either the process of representing [...] in two's-complement notation without changing its value, or the calculation of the <b>two's</b> <b>complement,</b> which is the arithmetic negative of [...] if <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> representation is used.|$|R
5000|$|Offset binary, also {{referred}} to as excess-K, excess-N, excess code or biased representation, is a digital coding scheme where all-zero corresponds to the minimal negative value and all-one to the maximal positive value. There is no standard for offset binary, but most often the offset K for an n-bit binary word is K = 2n−1. This has the consequence that the [...] "zero" [...] value is represented by a 1 in the most significant bit and zero in all other bits, and in general the effect is conveniently the same as using <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> except that the most significant bit is inverted. It also has the consequence that in a logical comparison operation, one gets the same result as with a <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> numerical comparison operation, whereas, in <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> notation a logical comparison will agree with <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> numerical comparison operation if and only if the numbers being compared have the same sign. Otherwise the sense of the comparison will be inverted, with all negative values being taken as being larger than all positive values.|$|E

50|$|<b>Two's</b> <b>complement</b> is {{the easiest}} to {{implement}} in hardware, {{which may be the}} ultimate reason for its widespread popularity. Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistorseliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings. Mainframes such as the IBM System/360, the GE-600 series, and the PDP-6 and PDP-10 use <b>two's</b> <b>complement,</b> as did minicomputers such as the PDP-5 and PDP-8 and the PDP-11 and VAX. The architects of the early integrated circuit-based CPUs (Intel 8080, etc.) chose to use <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> math. As IC technology advanced, virtually all adopted <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> technology. x86, m68k, Power Architecture, MIPS, SPARC, ARM, Itanium, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha processors are all <b>two's</b> <b>complement.</b>|$|R

2500|$|To get the <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> of {{a binary}} number, the bits are inverted, or [...] "flipped", {{by using the}} bitwise NOT operation; the value of 1 is then added to the {{resulting}} value, ignoring the overflow which occurs when taking the <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> of 0.|$|R
50|$|Integral minifloats in one byte have {{a greater}} range of ±122880 than <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> integer with a range −128 to +127. The greater range is {{compensated}} by a poor precision, because there are only 4 mantissa bits, equivalent to slightly more than one decimal place. They also have greater range than half-precision minifloats with range ±65504, also compensated by lack of fractions and poor precision.|$|E
5000|$|The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) uses {{various sizes}} of exponent, but also uses offset {{notation}} for {{the format of}} each precision. Unusually however, instead of using [...] "excess 2n−1" [...] it uses [...] "excess 2n−1 − 1" [...] (i.e. excess-15, excess-127, excess-1023, excess-16383) which means that inverting the leading (high-order) bit of the exponent will not convert the exponent to correct <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> notation.|$|E
50|$|This {{does not}} affect CRC {{generation}} and checking in any way, as long as both generator and checker use the same initial value. Any non-zero initial value will do, and a few standards specify unusual values, but the all-ones value (−1 in <b>twos</b> <b>complement</b> binary) {{is by far the}} most common. Note that a one-pass CRC generate/check will still produce a result of zero when the message is correct, regardless of the preset value.|$|E
25|$|Many early computers, {{including}} the CDC 6600, the LINC, the PDP-1, and the UNIVAC 1107, use ones' complement notation; {{the descendants of}} the UNIVAC 1107, the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, continue to do so. The IBM 700/7000 series scientific machines use sign/magnitude notation, except for the index registers which are <b>two's</b> <b>complement.</b> Early commercial <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> computers include the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-5 and the 1963 PDP-6. The System/360, introduced in 1964 by IBM, then the dominant player in the computer industry, made <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> the most widely used binary representation in the computer industry. The first minicomputer, the PDP-8 introduced in 1965, uses <b>two's</b> <b>complement</b> arithmetic as do the 1969 Data General Nova, the 1970 PDP-11, and almost all subsequent minicomputers and microcomputers.|$|R

50|$|Most {{standard}} computer CPU chips cannot {{handle the}} offset binary format directly. CPU chips typically can only handle signed and unsigned integers, and floating point value formats. Offset binary values {{can be handled}} in several ways by these CPU chips. The data may just be treated as unsigned integers, requiring the programmer {{to deal with the}} zero offset in software. The data may also be converted to signed integer format (which the CPU can handle natively) by simply subtracting the zero offset. As a consequence of the most common offset for an n-bit word being 2^(n-1), which implies that the first bit is inverted relative to <b>twos</b> <b>complement,</b> {{there is no need for}} a separate subtraction step, but one simply can invert the first bit.
