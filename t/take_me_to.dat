25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see cowboy movies {{all the time when}} I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

500|$|DOOM and Madlib {{decided to}} work on {{different}} projects. Madlib released Champion Sound with J Dilla, while DOOM released two solo albums: <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> Your Leader, as King Geedorah, and Vaudeville Villain, as Viktor Vaughn. Nevertheless, {{after the release of}} these albums, they decided to return to Madvillainy. For {{the final version of the}} album, DOOM altered his voice, described by Peanut Butter Wolf as going from [...] "really hyper, more enthusiastic" [...] to [...] "a more mellow, relaxed, confident, less abrasive", and changed some lyrics to coincide with this change. Madlib was also asked by the label to change some instrumentals, but told them that he forgot the samples he used, in order to allow for them to remain on the album. Additionally, the label also requested the duo make a proper ending for the album, forcing them to rent a studio for the recording of [...] "Rhinestone Cowboy". The beat used, however, was produced in Brazil.|$|E
500|$|Affleck acted professionally {{throughout}} his childhood but, {{in his own}} words, [...] "not {{in the sense that}} I had a mom that wanted to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something." [...] He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{compared}} the song to {{the works of}} Spears. James Dinh of MTV News said that [...] "Gomez, who has gushed to us about her Spears fandom, shows off her best impersonation" [...] in the song. While reviewing the We Own the Night Tour, Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the song [...] "sound {{as if it was}} ripped directly from Spears' catalog." [...] Blair Kelly of musicOMH compared it to the music of Circus, and more specifically to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008). It was also compared by Tim Sendra of Allmusic to the [...] "electro glam" [...] sound of Goldfrapp. The lyrics of [...] "Whiplash" [...] speak of a blossoming romance. Gomez sings in the chorus, [...] "Come on and <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the other side / I'm blown away, when I look into your eyes /I'm so in love, I think I'm going to crash / And get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years {{trying to get their}} film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of a}} year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He showed me a letter from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! They <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood and they have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman thing. He could see Hollywood for what it was." ...|$|E

The original procedure called for Glenn to exit through the top hatch, but he was uncomfortably warm and decided that egress through the side hatch would be faster. During the flight, he endured 7.8 G's of acceleration and traveled [...] at about [...] The flight took Glenn to a maximum altitude (apogee) of about [...] and a minimum altitude of [...] (perigee) at a speed of about [...] The flight made Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth, the third American in space, and the fifth human in space. The mission, which Glenn called [...] "best day of his life", renewed U.S. confidence. His flight occurred while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were embroiled in the Cold War and competing in the Space Race.|$|E

500|$|McAdams is an environmentalist. She ran an {{eco-friendly}} lifestyle website GreenIsSexy.org {{with two}} of her friends for five years, from 2007 to 2011. Her house is powered by Bullfrog renewable energy. She travels around Toronto by bicycle and does not own a car, but drives when in Los Angeles because it is [...] "a harder town to cycle in". She volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi and Louisiana in fall of 2005, {{as part of the}} clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. McAdams sat on a TreeHugger/Live Earth judging panel in 2007. She appealed for donations during the Canada for Haiti telethon in 2010. She was involved in Matter of Trust's [...] "hair boom" [...] efforts following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. In 2011, McAdams supported Foodstock, a protest against a proposed limestone mega quarry in Melancthon, Ontario. In 2013, she filmed two promotional videos for the Food & Water First Movement, aiming to preserve prime farmland and source water in Ontario, Canada. In 2014, she narrated the feature documentary <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> The River, which investigates what is being done to try to save iconic rivers.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
