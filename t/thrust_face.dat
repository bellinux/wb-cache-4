5000|$|There {{are serious}} {{disadvantages}} to running many engines backwards under load {{for any length}} of time, and some of these reasons are general, applying equally to both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. This disadvantage is accepted in most cases where cost, weight and size are major considerations. The problem comes about because in [...] "forwards" [...] running the major <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> of the piston is on the back face of the cylinder which, in a two-stroke particularly, is the coolest and best-lubricated part. The forward face of the piston in a trunk engine is less well-suited to be the major <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> since it covers and uncovers the exhaust port in the cylinder, the hottest part of the engine, where piston lubrication is at its most marginal. The front face of the piston is also more vulnerable since the exhaust port, the largest in the engine, is in the front wall of the cylinder. Piston skirts and rings risk being extruded into this port, so it is always better to have them pressing hardest on the opposite wall (where there are only the transfer ports in a crossflow engine) and there is good support. In some engines, the small end is offset to reduce thrust in the intended rotational direction and the forward face of the piston has been made thinner and lighter to compensate - but when running backwards, this weaker forward face suffers increased mechanical stress it was not designed to resist. This can be avoided by the use of crossheads and also using thrust bearings to isolate the engine from end loads.|$|E

40|$|The first {{portion of}} this report {{discusses}} measurements of friction made in the altitude laboratory of the Bureau of Standards between 1920 and 1926 under research authorization of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. These are discussed {{with reference to the}} influence of speed, barometric pressure, jacket-water temperature, and throttle opening upon the friction of aviation engines. The second section of the report deals with measurements of the friction of a group of pistons differing from each other in a single respect, such as length, clearance, area of <b>thrust</b> <b>face,</b> location of <b>thrust</b> <b>face,</b> etc. Results obtained with each type of piston are discussed and attention is directed particularly {{to the fact that the}} friction chargeable to piston rings depends upon piston design as well as upon ring design. This is attributed to the effect of the rings upon the thickness and distribution of the oil film which in turn affects the friction of the piston to an extent which depends upon its design...|$|E

The one-way analysis of variance(ANOVA) method of investigation to test for the differences between themanufacturing data is employed in the ‘analysis phase’.

30|$|The process {{capability}} studies on <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> thickness, bolt hole center distance and crank pin bore diameter critical-to-quality characteristics of connecting rod were performed.

30|$|This paper {{witnesses}} {{an application}} of process tolerancing which proves {{to be a better}} way of finding the optimal tolerancing of the part, leading to fewer process rejections and improved quality levels. The end results of the process capability values and tolerances obtained from tolerance charting of connecting rod machining process are compared with a tolerance capability expert software. The results showed further scope of improvement for the <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> thickness and gudgeon pin bore diameter, whereas the crank pin bore diameter after honing operation showed close resemblance between the values obtained through process capability and tolerance capability expert software.|$|E
30|$|In this phase, the <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> {{thickness}} data of 30 nominal consecutive readingsis {{collected and}} plotted {{on the process}} monitoring chart. This data collectionwas performed in four iterations. In each iteration, the data set of thrust facewidth measurement readings is taken and analyzed for Cp and Cpk values and followed by the suitable corrective action. Thecorrective action was decided based on the cause-and-effect diagram. After thecorrective action was implemented, the next iteration was performed. Thisprocedure was continued until the Cp and Cpk values are {{greater than or equal}} to 1.33, i.e., up to 4 σ quality level as decided by the management of the enginemanufacturing plant.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis of film generation at the rotating {{contact between the}} gear tooth end faces and bearing block <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> seal in a high-pressure aerospace fuel pump. The analysis includes the effect of tilt of the face seal together with elastic deformation and surface roughness of the contacting components. The results of the analysis show that relatively thin hydrodynamic films are generated and that the most likely mode of lubrication is that of mixed lubrication in which part of the load is carried by direct contact at asperity junctions. It is shown that a small improvement in film formation might be obtained by careful profiling or crowning of the end faces of the gears...|$|E

30|$|Pareek and Bhamniya (2013) {{used the}} Taguchi and ANOVA methods for finding an optimum {{value of the}} melting temperature, {{injection}} pressure and cooling time for an injection molding process. Lal and Vasudevan (2013) employed the Taguchi method comprising S/N ratio and orthogonal arrays for determining the optimum combinations of the process conditions for shrinkage in molding of low-density polyethylene (LPDE). The {{results showed that the}} cooling time was the most effective factor for LPDE followed by refilling pressure and injection pressure was found to be the least effective factor. Mariajayaprakash et al. (2013) found the optimum process parameters of shock absorber process using failure mode and effect analysis and genetic algorithm. Chen et al. (2013) studied on simultaneous optimization of multiple interrelated quality indices, leading to product quality improvement in the field of plastic injection molding. The component under consideration was the thin front cover of a digital camera. The ANOVA methodology was applied to find the significant process parameters that affect the part’s quality indices and efficient frontier of the process parameters was found with only a few experiments. Sharma and Srinivasa Rao (2013) implemented the six sigma DMAIC and ANOVA combinational approach for improving the machining process performance of <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> width grinding of a connecting rod of an internal combustion engine. The cause and effect relationship, FMEA and the ANOVA were finally used for identifying the root cause and improving the sigma levels of the connecting rod machining process.|$|E
30|$|Xue and Ji (2001) {{proposed}} a methodology {{for dealing with}} angular features in tolerance charting. Ji and Xue (2002) obtained the mean working dimensions from the reverse chain matrix containing reverse tolerance chains. Huang et al. (2005) devised a procedure for determining the process tolerances directly from multiple correlated critical tolerances in an assembly. Process-oriented tolerancing was focused upon, by considering all the variations arising due to tool wear, measurement device fluctuations, tolerance stack-up propagation (Ding et al. 2005). A process optimization model was introduced which considers process means and process tolerances simultaneously, with sequential operation adjustment to reduce process variability, and with part compensation to offset process shifting (Jeang et al. 2007). Peng et al. (2008) derived quality loss function of interrelated critical-to-quality dimensions. Through this quality loss function, the design-tolerances of the component are determined for achieving an improved product as well as process quality. The tolerance chart balancing was mathematically modeled for minimizing the manufacturing cost and quality loss (Jeang 2011). Concurrent tolerancing was identified as an optimization problem and a feasible solution for systematically distributing the process tolerances within the design constraints was proposed (Sivakumar et al. 2012). Contreras (2013) proposed simplification of tolerance chains through a surface position tolerance (SPT) method for tolerance chart balancing. Chen et al. (2013) optimized the process parameters for the plastic injection molding. An improvement in the process potential capability index (C p) and process performance capability index (C pk) was registered through process capability improvement studies on <b>thrust</b> <b>face</b> thickness characteristic of connecting rod (Sharma and Rao 2013).|$|E
