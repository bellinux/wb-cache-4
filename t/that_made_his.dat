5|$|As the Confederate forces {{approached}} Vicksburg, Pemberton {{could put}} only 18,500 troops in his lines. Grant had over 35,000, {{with more on}} the way. However, Pemberton had the advantage of terrain and fortifications <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> defense nearly impregnable. The defensive line around Vicksburg ran approximately 6.5 miles, based on terrain of varying elevations that included hills and knobs with steep angles for an attacker to ascend under fire. The perimeter included many gun pits, forts, trenches, redoubts, and lunettes. The major fortifications of the line included Fort Hill, on a high bluff north of the city; the Stockade Redan, dominating the approach to the city on Graveyard Road from the northeast; the 3rd Louisiana Redan; the Great Redoubt; the Railroad Redoubt, protecting the gap for the railroad line entering the city; the Square Fort (Fort Garrott); a salient along the Hall's Ferry Road; and the South Fort.|$|E
5|$|Cameron Rahles-Rahbula, {{competing}} at {{his fourth}} Winter Paralympics, was named as the Australian flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony. After being named flag bearer, Rahles-Rahbula had a skiing training accident <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> participation doubtful. He {{went on to}} carry the flag but withdrew from the Games on medical advice. At Opening Ceremony, the entire Australian team of nine athletes, coaches, medical staff and administration officials wore the black arm bands to remember Matthew Robinson, who had recently {{died as a result}} of a skiing accident. Ben Tudhope, the youngest competitor at the Games, carried the Australian flag at the Closing Ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E

5|$|Manuel's {{death on}} 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son Alexios II Komnenos on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent at the office, {{but it was}} his mother, Maria of Antioch, and her Frankish {{background}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> regency unpopular. Eventually, Andronikos I Komnenos, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent coup d'état. Utilizing his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, he marched on to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a massacre of the Latins. After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II, and took his 12-year-old wife Agnes of France for himself.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he had}} been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier {{had told him that}} if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, Domnall mac Taidc {{appears to}} have forcefully seized the kingship of the Isles. Although it is {{possible}} that he had backing from Ua Briain himself, there is evidence to suggest <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> move without Ua Briain's consent. Not long after this undertaking, Domnall {{appears to have}} been either forced from the Isles, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Ua Briain's failing health, only to be slain himself in 1115. The encroachment of competing Irish factions into the Isles may well have been as unpalatable to the English and Scots as the power vacuum left in the wake of Magnús' demise. Since the chronicle records that the subsequent reign of Óláfr lasted forty years, the latter's accession to the kingship appears to date to about 1112 or 1113, not long after Domnall launched his bid for the throne. In fact, the chronicle indicates that Óláfr spent his youth at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), and it appears that this restoration of the Crovan dynasty, in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother, was the work of the English king.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he be able to call his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E

25|$|Charles was now {{willing to}} offer {{concrete}} advantages in territory and authority {{in exchange for}} other powers' worthless recognitions of the Pragmatic Sanction <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> daughter Maria Theresa his heir.

It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.|$|E
25|$|The Khan also {{employed}} tactics <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> numbers seem {{greater than}} they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised {{a cloud of dust}} that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched to whistle as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Charles VI relinquished many of {{the gains}} the empire made in the {{previous}} years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg.

With the rise of Prussia, the Austrian–Prussian dualism began in Germany.

For this act, Zeus suspended Apollo from the night sky and commanded Apollo to serve Admetus, King of Thessaly for a year. Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> thunderbolts.
