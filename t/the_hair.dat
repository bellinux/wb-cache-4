5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

5|$|Snake {{is arrested}} for smoking inside the Kwik-E-Mart. Chief Wiggum {{explains}} {{that this is}} Snake's third strike, so he will be executed {{in accordance with the}} three strikes law. Before hauling Snake away, Chief Wiggum points out that Apu, Moe, and Bart are all witnesses; Snake vows to kill them all. After the execution, Homer visits Dr. Nick, who transplants Snake's hair onto Homer's head. When Homer goes to sleep the following night, it plants its roots in Homer's brain. With <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> controlling his mind, Homer murders Apu and Moe. Bart realizes that the other two witnesses have been killed, and Homer vows to protect him. Homer locks himself and Bart in a room, but Snake's hair takes control of him. Homer tries to kill Bart with a sledgehammer. Bart begs Homer to fight <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and, after a struggle, Homer rips <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> off his head. Wiggum bursts in and shoots <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> dead.|$|E

5|$|Help!... It's <b>the</b> <b>Hair</b> Bear Bunch! is an American {{animated}} television series, {{produced by}} Hanna-Barbera, which originally aired for one season on CBS from September 11, 1971, to January 8, 1972. Daws Butler, Paul Winchell and Bill Callaway voice the three bears that comprise <b>the</b> <b>Hair</b> Bear Bunch, while John Stephenson and Joe E.

5|$|In syndication, {{the series}} was replayed on several {{television}} networks after its cancellation. USA Network ran the series beginning February 19, 1989, and until November 7, 1991.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hair</b> {{color of}} Highland cattle {{can vary from}} black, brindled, red, yellow and dun. The coat colors are caused by alleles at the MC1R gene (Elocus) and the PMEL or SILV gene (Dlocus).|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon.

While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates.

40|$|Cercal hairs {{represent}} in cricket a wind sensitive escape system, able {{to detect}} the airflow generated from predating species. These sensors have been studied as a biomimetic concept to allow the development of MEMS for biomedical use. In particular, the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> including airflow response, resonant frequency and damping, has been investigated up to a frequency of 20 kHz. The microscopic nature of <b>the</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>the</b> complex vibrations of excited <b>hairs</b> and <b>the</b> high damping of the system suggested {{that the use of}} Laser Doppler vibrometry could possibly improve the test performance. Two types of tests were performed: in the first case <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> were indirectly excited using the signal obtained from a vibrating aluminium plate, whilst in the second case <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> were directly excited using a white noise chirp. The results from the first experiment indicated that <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> move in-phase with the exciting signal up to frequencies in the order of 10 kHz, responding to the vibration modes of the plate with a signal attenuation of 12 to 20 dB. The chirp experiment revealed the presence of rotational resonant modes at 6850 and 11300 Hz. No clear effect of hair length was perceivable on the vibration response of the filiform sensors. The obtained results proved promising to support the mechanical and vibration characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>hairs</b> and suggest that scanning Laser vibrometry can be used extensively on highly dampened biological materials...|$|R
