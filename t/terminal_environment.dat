In addition to the waypoints, altitudes and minimum visibility requirements necessary to line up an aircraft with a designated runway for landing, they also provide important navigational information such as course headings and navigational aids' radio frequencies. This information allows aircraft to safely transition from the enroute airway segment (which provides guidance for safe flight between the flight origination and destination) through the <b>terminal</b> <b>environment</b> (where aircraft transition from the enroute airway segment to the airspace in the immediate vicinity of the airport) to a safe landing on the designated runway.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Numerous studies {{discuss that}} Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} can provide better container handling efficiency; however, {{relative lack of}} research concerns the tracking and monitoring the movement of vehicle in the container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment.</b> Thus, this study aims at discussing the feasibility of applying RFID for vehicle tracking purpose in a container terminal. Design/methodology/approach: This study makes use {{of a series of}} experiments in a container terminal to discuss the factors that affect the use of RFID in the terminal. The possibility and accuracy of using RFID in such challenging environment is also investigated. These propositions are investigated by a case study. Findings: The experimental results indicate that the RFID communication is good at the containers area which occupies nearly all the area in the container terminal. However, in other area such as sea side and free area, the performance is not good and 100 % readability only achieved in 5 m and 10 m in free area and sea side respectively. Originality/value: The container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment,</b> which consists of different transport vehicles for onward transportation, will affect the performance of RFID readability.

40|$|Abstract A {{key issue}} in {{automated}} seaport container terminals is {{the assignment of}} transportation orders to automated guided vehicles (AGVs). For AGV dispatching two basic types of strategies can be applied, which differ by {{the length of the}} look-ahead period and the rescheduling strategy. The on-line dispatching strategy uses myopic dispatching rules, which have been adopted from flexible manufacturing systems. This strategy schedules only one operation at a time without ever changing an existing schedule. As an alternative, a pattern-based off-line heuristic developed by the authors can be applied. This heuristic creates predictive schedules comprising a sequence of pick-up and drop-off operations for each vehicle getting available during a given look-ahead horizon. To evaluate the performance of the dispatching strategies a comprehensive simulation study is performed. The scenarios investigated reflect realistic <b>terminal</b> <b>environments</b> and consider stochastic variations in the timing and processing of loading and unloading operations of containers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} and propose a new amplify-andforward cooperative spatial multiplexing scheme {{in which the}} transmitter (source), equipped with a single antenna, forms virtual antenna array from a collection of distributed singleantenna wireless terminals, and broadcasts identical signal to those terminals (relays). Each relay amplifies and forwards different portion of the received signal at a reduced data rate to the receiver (destination). The receiver, equipped with multiple antennas, nulls and cancels the interference from different relays in order of the signal-to-noise ratio, and detects the original signal transmitted from the source. The combination of transmitter, relays, and receiver forms a virtual MIMO system in singleantenna wireless <b>terminals</b> <b>environment.</b> Unlike the conventional spatial multiplexing scheme, the proposed scheme does not require multiple antennas at the transmitter side, making it to be particularly useful for uplink (mobile to base-station) data transmissions. It is shown that {{the performance of the}} proposed system approaches and, in some cases, surpasses that of the conventional MIMO spatial multiplexing scheme. I...|$|R

40|$|Automated guided {{vehicles}} (AGVs) {{are increasingly}} becoming the popular mode of container transport in seaport terminals. These unmanned vehicles {{are used to}} transfer containers between ships and storage locations on land. The efficiency of a container terminal {{is directly related to}} the amount of time each vessel spends in the port. Hence to maintain competitive advantage and increase the efficiency of the container terminal it is necessary to determine the appropriate number of AGVs to deploy, and formulate good dispatching strategies for these AGVs. Existing techniques available in the literature use a variety of heuristic methods for dispatching the automated guided vehicles. These methods have been primarily developed to work in a manufacturing context where the network structure is simple and only a small number of such vehicles are required. The situation in seaport terminals however entails a greater network complexity and also a large fleet of 80 or more automated guided vehicles. There is little experimental evidence on how these techniques perform in a container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment.</b> Furthermore, for the handful of papers on AGV dispatching in a <b>terminal</b> <b>environment,</b> to the best of our knowledge, none of the proposed methods have explicitly considered the effects o...|$|E

This research supports the introduction and use of Synthetic Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (SVS/EFVS) as advanced cockpit vision technologies in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. Twelve air transport-rated crews participated in a motion-base simulation experiment to evaluate the use of SVS/EFVS in NextGen low visibility approach and landing operations.

40|$|The {{content of}} the project report {{compiled}} in this document provides the reader with knowledge of operations at a container terminal and how a non-finite queueing theory model {{has been applied to}} the Port of Durban Container Terminal. The document initially discusses the general operations at a container terminal and type of equipment used and what their functions are. The document describes the specific operations at the two piers of the Port of Durban Container Terminal and at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The Port of Rotterdam‟s Container Terminal operations serve as a benchmark to evaluate the Port of Durban Container Terminal operations. The main section of the report is a discussion on the non-finite queueing model which was created for the container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment.</b> The respective methods used and how the service and arrival rates of the model were established and calculated. The non-finite queueing model makes use of multi-server queueing theory and Jackson‟s rule to evaluate the models and calculate the total time a container has to wait in a queue for busy equipment, from when the container is unloaded from the sea vessel until it is stored in the stacking area. The aim of the model is to obtain the number of vehicles or equipment needed per quay crane to achieve a balanced system. A balanced system was defined as one where the least delays and congestion occur. The simulation model created in Simio was used to simulate the container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment</b> of the Port of Durban and the Port of Rotterdam container terminals. The aim of the simulation model was to obtain results from a different perspective. The simulation results are compared to the results of the queueing theory model, which are analysed, discussed and compared to a framework defined by a functionary from the container <b>terminal</b> <b>environment.</b> The end result was that the queueing theory model provided reliable results. The results for Pier 1 were that four truck-trailer units and four rubber tyre gantries should be assigned to a single quay crane. In the Pier 2 system, four straddle carriers should be assigned to a quay crane. iii The advantage of using the most balanced number of vehicles or equipment in the container terminal is that vessels can be processed faster, keeping customers satisfied and generating a greater profit.

40|$|The {{importance}} of passenger experience in aviation has become well {{understood in the}} last several years. It is now generally accepted that the provision of good passenger experience is not an option, but a necessity, from an aviation profitability perspective. In this paper, we paint a picture of the future passenger experience by consolidating a number of industry and research perspectives. Using the future passenger experience as a starting point, we explore the components needed to enable this future vision. From this bottom-up approach, we identify the need to resolve data formatting and data ownership issues. The resolution of these data integration issues is necessary to enable the seamless future travel experience that is envisioned by the aviation industry. By looking at the passenger experience from this bottom-up, data centric perspective, we identify a potential shift in the way that future passenger terminals will be designed.
