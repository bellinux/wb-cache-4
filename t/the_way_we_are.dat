In November 2001, R duo Chemistry's debut album <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> sold over 1.14 million copies in the first week, and debuted at the number-one position on the Oricon weekly album charts. Hip hop bands such as Rip Slyme and Ketsumeishi were also at the top of the Oricon charts.|$|E
25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E

500|$|Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's {{films are}} {{considered}} by film historian Michel Ciment to be [...] "among {{the most important}} contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [...] Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, [...] have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick [...] "tells a story is antithetical to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> accustomed to receiving stories" [...] and that [...] "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: [...] "Among those whom I would call 'younger generation', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant." ...|$|E

"Thriller" [...] {{serves as}} an autobiographical recap of the two years {{following}} From Under the Cork Trees release, referencing the band's mediocre CD reviews and breakout success, as well as thanking their [...] "diehard" [...] fans. The song discusses the band's Best New Artist Grammy loss, and Wentz calls it the [...] "most narcissistic song on the album". The line [...] "Fix me in forty-five" [...] is {{a reference to the}} length of a therapy session. On [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song [...] "kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves – {{to the point where it}} just becomes oversaturated." [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer..." [...] has been described as [...] "about as close to a love song as you'll get from this band, a rare moment of tenderness among songs about blog entries, guest lists, and therapy sessions." [...] In a tribute to the politicized Chicago hardcore scene, Wentz describes the story of a rigged court case of African-American civil rights activist Fred Hampton, Jr. in [...] "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave". The song has been described as a [...] "very well-written track, a welcome respite from the one-liners which permeate the majority of the record." ...|$|E

5000|$|Comparing {{ourselves}} to others is something humans {{do all the}} time. [...] "In doing so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> acknowledging not so much our sameness to othersor our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because {{each one of us}} is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> different from one another and differences in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same.

500|$|Patrick Kombayi, an MDC {{politician}} {{and member of}} the Zimbabwean Senate, said after Smith's death that Zimbabweans had much to thank him for. [...] "The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith," [...] he said. [...] "All the infrastructure is Smith's. We never suffered <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [...] pound was {{on a par with the}} Zimbabwean dollar, but President Mugabe has killed all that." [...] David Coltart, another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith's death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be [...] "disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister"; Coltart considered Smith's policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe's rise to power and thereby [...] "directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today". Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as [...] "draconian"; he also pointed out that these [...] "levers of repression" [...] had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did. Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with Heidi Holland, saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he [...] "absolutely had to choose"; Smith was, in his opinion, [...] "a bigoted, stupid man" [...] responsible for all of Zimbabwe's problems.|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E
