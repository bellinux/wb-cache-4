5|$|Michael Vehe, a Dominican monk and theologian, took in 1537 {{the medieval}} stanza as a {{starting}} point which he completed by adding three different stanzas. His version appears with <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> melody in the first German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 870 for the Diocese of Limburg. In the main section of that hymnal, it appeared as GL 248 again in a different version, with stanzas two to four written in 1972 by Maria Luise Thurmair, who closed with a fifth stanza modeled after Vehe's second. The melody is a transcription of <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> in fixed rhythm. This version was kept in the second edition of the Gotteslob, GL 348.|$|E

5|$|Dodd {{performed}} in several major Australian movies, including Gallipoli and <b>The</b> <b>Chant</b> of Jimmie Blacksmith, {{in which he}} played Tabidgi, the murdering uncle of the lead character. He also held minor parts in Australia-based international film productions including The Coca-Cola Kid, Quigley Down Under and The Matrix. He likewise appeared in minor roles in early Australian television series, such as Homicide and Rush, as well as later series including The Flying Doctors. In 2013, Dodd was honoured with the Jimmy Little Lifetime Achievement Award at the 19th Deadly Awards at the Sydney Opera House. He died in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chant</b> of Jimmie Blacksmith was not {{the only}} film in which Dodd {{appeared}} that addressed topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after Jimmie Blacksmith, Dodd performed in Ground Zero, again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles. This film is a thriller based on claims that Indigenous Australians were used as human guinea pigs in the British nuclear tests at Maralinga. The film uses as its context the McClelland Royal Commission, which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.|$|E
5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.|$|E
50|$|While {{jump rope}} {{continues}} as a sport outside of school, <b>the</b> <b>chants</b> were discontinued {{in the early}} 1970s with school authorities concerned about accidents, content of <b>the</b> <b>chants,</b> misuse of rope, etc. The attraction of television was a factor along with diminishment of children playing outdoors for various reasons including safety.|$|R
25|$|During {{one game}} in the 1990s, <b>the</b> fans started <b>chanting</b> <b>the</b> name of Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez. Martinez responded to <b>the</b> <b>chanting</b> fans with a wave, {{shocking}} the cheering fans; this started the tradition of Roll Call where <b>the</b> Bleacher Creatures <b>chant</b> <b>the</b> name of each starting fielder (except the pitcher and catcher). Roll Call {{has become one of}} the trademarks of Yankee Stadium.|$|R

5|$|At last, in May 1877, {{the day of}} {{recognition}} came, {{with the opening of}} the first exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery, when the Days of Creation, The Beguiling of Merlin, and the Mirror of Venus were all shown. Burne-Jones followed up the signal success of these pictures with Laus Veneris, <b>the</b> <b>Chant</b> d'Amour, Pan and Psyche, and other works, exhibited in 1878. Most of these pictures are painted in brilliant colours. A change is noticeable the next year, 1879, in the Annunciation and in the four pictures making up the second series of Pygmalion and the Image; the former of these, one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist's works, is subdued and sober; in the latter a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted, not with entire success. A similar temperance of colours marks The Golden Stairs, first exhibited in 1880. The almost sombre Wheel of Fortune was shown in 1883, followed in 1884 by King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid, in which Burne-Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour, refined by the period of self-restraint. He next turned to two important sets of pictures, The Briar Rose and The Story of Perseus, though these were not completed for some years.|$|E

25|$|In some Jewish communities, it is {{customary}} for the Kohanim {{to raise}} their hands and recite an extended musical chant without words before reciting the last word of each phrase. There are different tunes for this chant in different communities. Aside from its pleasant sound, <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> is done so that the congregation may silently offer certain prayers containing individual requests of God after {{each of the three}} blessings of the Kohanim. Because supplications of this nature are not permitted on Shabbat, <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> is also not done on Shabbat. In Israel, though, this chanting is not the custom.|$|E

25|$|The {{pieces that}} do not fall {{into any of the}} three types are Auf meinen lieben Gott BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> (Magnificats BuxWV 203–5 and Te Deum laudamus, BuxWV 218), which are {{structurally}} similar to chorale fantasias.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{classes of}} Gregorian chant have a {{separate}} musical formula for each mode, allowing one section of <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the psalm verses that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri.

25|$|One famous chant by the Buckeye fans, usually {{starting}} with {{the students in the}} South Stands, is O-H-I-O.

25|$|True antiphonal {{performance}} by two alternating choruses still occurs, as in certain German monasteries. However, antiphonal chants are generally performed in responsorial style by a solo cantor alternating with a chorus. This practice {{appears to have}} begun in the Middle Ages. Another medieval innovation had the solo cantor sing the opening words of responsorial chants, with the full chorus finishing {{the end of the}} opening phrase. This innovation allowed the soloist to fix the pitch of <b>the</b> <b>chant</b> for the chorus and to cue the choral entrance.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>chant</b> (mele) is {{typically}} {{accompanied by an}} ipu heke (a double gourd) and/or pahu (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ipu (single gourd), iliili (waterworn lava stone castanets),uliuli (feathered gourd rattles), pu`li (split bamboo sticks) or kalaau (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called kahiko, while the modern version is auana. There are also religious chants called oli; when accompanied by dancing and drums, it is called mele hula pahu.|$|E

His works range from short, three-voice pieces to large-scale compositions for 12- and 24-voice choirs. Titov {{was one of the}} most important followers of Nikolay Diletsky's Idea grammatiki musikiiskoi (1679), an influential treatise on composition.

25|$|The Megillah is {{read with}} a cantillation (a {{traditional}} chant) differing from that {{used in the}} customary reading of the Torah.

These verses are particularly sad, or they refer to Jews being in exile. When the Megillah reader jumps to the melody of the book of Lamentations for these phrases, it heightens the feeling of sadness in the listener.|$|E
