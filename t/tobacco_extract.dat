Here, we present our study on isolating tobacco compounds with fungicidal activity, {{which could be used}} as plant-derived pesticides. Using Valsa mali as the target fungus, agar plate tests were conducted to evaluate the fungicidal activity of various <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts,</b> including <b>tobacco</b> leaves <b>extracts</b> prepared with different solvents, <b>extracts</b> of different <b>tobacco</b> cultivars, and samples from different tobacco organs. Fungal growth morphology was used as the criterion to evaluate the fungicidal activity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts.</b> Correlation analyses between the fungicidal activities and the chemical components of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> indicated the major chemical constituents with fungicidal activity. Then, the active compounds were isolated and their effects on the ultra-microstructures of V. mali was analyzed using scanning- and transmission-electron microscopy. The results suggested that <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> prepared with solvents of weaker polarity had higher fungicidal activity, and the inhibitory activity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> against V. mali was also cultivar dependent. Furthermore, the fungicidal effects of <b>tobacco</b> flower <b>extracts</b> were higher than those of the leaf extracts. Chemical analysis indicated that cembranoids were the main fungicidal substances, which act by destroying the endometrial structure of the fungus. Tobacco cembranoids at 80 μg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of V. mali, with an EC 50 value of 13. 18 μg/mL.

Previous reports investigating the effects of nicotine and tobacco on platelet function are inconsistent. The present study investigated in vitro effects of nicotine, its major metabolites, <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> and extract of tobacco-free snuff on human platelets. None of the metabolites cotinine, cotinine-N-oxide, nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide or trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1 – 10  μM) affected platelet aggregation or P-selectin expression. Nicotine (10  μM) weakly increased platelet aggregation, whereas trans- 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (0. 1  μM) and nicotine- 1 ′-N-oxide (1 – 10  μM) weakly inhibited adhesion to fibrinogen. To elucidate the influence of other tobacco compounds, we investigated the impact of moist <b>tobacco</b> and smoke <b>extracts</b> on platelet function. Filtered extracts of oral snuff, cigarette smoke and tobacco free snuff inhibited platelet adhesion concentration-dependently. The inhibitory effects of <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> on platelet adhesion were independent of nicotine content and the nitric-oxide-pathway and not mediated through a platelet-nicotine-receptor. Taken together, <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> inhibit platelet activation during short-term in vitro challenge. As only limited effects of nicotine and nicotine metabolites were seen, the tobacco-induced platelet inhibition are likely induced by other compounds present in tobacco and tobacco free snuff.

In plants, these proteins may function, for example, in cell wall synthesis and/or in synthesis of starch. We have isolated wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) Rgp cDNA clones to study the function of RGPs. Sequence comparisons showed the existence of two classes of RGP proteins, designated RGP 1 and RGP 2. Glucosylation activity of RGP 1 and RGP 2 from wheat and rice was studied. After separate expression of Rgp 1 and Rgp 2 in Escherichia coli or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), only RGP 1 showed self-glucosylation. In Superose 12 fractions from wheat endosperm extract, a polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 40 kD is glucosylated by UDP-glucose. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, overexpressing either wheat Rgp 1 or Rgp 2, were generated. Subsequent glucosylation assays revealed that in RGP 1 -containing <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> {{as well as in}} RGP 2 -containing <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> UDP-glucose is incorporated, indicating that an RGP 2 -containing complex is active.

Despite numerous reports on the general toxic effects of oral smokeless tobacco very few studies have assessed the effect of smokeless tobacco on the viability and inflammatory response of gingival epithelial cells. Material and Methods In this study a reference smokeless tobacco (CORESTA CRP 2) was used to stimulate gingival epithelial cells. Once the gingival epithelial cells became confluent, the growth medium were conditioned with aqueous extract of CORESTA CRP 2 for 3 and 6 hours. Cell viability was measured by alamar blue assay, and cell culture supernatant was examined for the presence of human interlukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results Cells treated with smokeless tobacco reference product resulted in decreased viability compared to non stimulated group (P< 0. 05).

The hapten 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) was used to induce colitis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Results indicated that both tobacco smoke exposure and subcutaneous nicotine differentially reduced colonic lesion size, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, luminol-amplified free radical generation, and leukotriene B 4 formation in the inflamed colon of colitis animals. These phenomena were accompanied by the downregulation of colonic interleukin (IL) - 1 b and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 protein expression. By treating the colitis animals with various <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts,</b> we further discovered that ethanol <b>extract</b> from filtered <b>tobacco</b> smoke could attenuate DNBS-evoked colonic damage and the elevated MPO activity, {{while at the same time}} it downregulated colonic IL- 1 b and MCP- 1 protein expression.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the existence of}} tissue transglutaminase in rabbit alveolar macrophages and measures the effects of cigarette smoke extracts on the activity of enzyme partially purified from these cells. The effects of smoke on transglutaminase purified from guinea pig liver are also measured. A water soluble component of gas-phase cigarette smoke inhibits both enzymes in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum inhibition of 65 % occurring at concentrations of smoke as low as 1 % {{in the case of}} the rabbit enzyme. The chemical oxidant N-chlorosuccinimide mimics the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of cigarette smoke on both enzyme systems. The thiol reducing agent, dithiothreitol, can prevent enzyme inactivation mediated by both smoke and N-chlorosuccinimide. Dithiothreitol is also capable of reversing inactivation mediated by cigarette smoke, but does not reverse inactivation caused by chemical oxidation with N-chlorosuccinimide. These data suggest that cigarette smoke inhibits transglutaminase activity via an oxidative mechanism that may selectively attack the active-site cysteine residue.

40|$|Bacterial {{beta-glucuronidase}} {{is often}} introduced into plants {{as a reporter}} gene fused to constitutive or inducible promoters, However, the presence of both endogenous inhibitors of GUS activity and endogenous GUS enzymes in transgenic plants could lead to an underestimation of GUS. In this paper, a decrease of the V-m values and a greater affinity (K-m) of the GUS enzyme for its substrate (p-NPG) has been recorded when increasing amounts of protein from untransformed tobacco cells {{has been added to}} the pure beta-glucuronidase. The observed inhibition is not competitive and can be completely removed when the <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts</b> are passed through Sephadex G- 25 spin columns prior to the assays. After such a treatment, the activity of E. coli GUS in transgenic tobacco cells (constitutive or inducible systems) was stimulated by a factor 1. 2 or 2 for p-NPG or 4 -MUG substrates, respectively. This method was also effective in suppressing the endogenous GUS or GUS-like activity which can interfere with the activity originating from the introduced GUS gene...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} in vitro {{characterization}} of PrpoB- 345, the tobacco rpoB promoter recognized by NEP, the phage-type plastid RNA polymerase. Transcription extracts were prepared from mutant tobacco plants lacking PEP, the Escherichia coli-like plastid-encoded RNA polymerase. Systematic dissection of a approximately 1 kb fragment {{determined that the}} rpoB promoter is contained in a 15 -nucleotide segment (- 14 to + 1) upstream of the transcription initiation site (+ 1). Point mutations at every nucleotide reduced transcription, except at the - 5 position which was neutral. Critical for rpoB promoter function was a CRT-motif (CAT or CGT) at - 8 to - 6 (transcription < 30 %), defining it as the promoter core. The core CAT sequence is also present in the maize rpoB promoter, which is faithfully recognized by <b>tobacco</b> <b>extracts.</b> Alignment of NEP promoters identified a CATA or TATA (=YATA) sequence at the rpoB core position, also present in plant mitochondrial promoters. Furthermore, NEP and the phage T 7 RNA polymerase exhibit similar sensitivity to inhibitors of transcription. These data indicate that the nuclear RpoZ gene, identified by sequence conservation with mitochondrial RNA polymerases, encodes the NEP catalytic subunit...|$|R

In order to identify each individual sulfur compound, sequential heart-cuts of 28 sulfur fractions from 1 D GC to 2 D GC were performed with the three MS detection modes (SCD/EI-TOF-MS, SCD/PCI–TOF-MS, and SCD/PCI–Q-TOF-MS). Thirty sulfur compounds were positively identified by MS library search, linear retention indices (LRI), molecular mass determination using PCI accurate mass spectra, formula calculation using EI and PCI accurate mass spectra, and structure elucidation using collision activated dissociation (CAD) of the protonated molecule. Additionally, 11 molecular formulas were obtained for unknown sulfur compounds. The determined values of the identified and unknown sulfur compounds were {{in the range of}} 10 – 740 ngmg total particulate matter (TPM) (RSD: 1. 2 – 12 %, n= 3) ...|$|R
