5|$|According to James, Anne wrote <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1696 {{requesting}} his {{permission to}} succeed William, and thereafter promising {{to restore the}} Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; he declined to give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.|$|E

'Unto them,' saith he, 'will I give in my house, and within my walls,' to them that worship there in truth, 'a place, and a name, better than of sons and of daughters' (Isa 56:5).|$|R

5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size.

5|$|In 1994, Mugabe {{received}} an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from {{him at the}} advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; {{this is the first time}} one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.|$|E

5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's {{release from}} prison on 20 December 1924, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organise the {{formation}} of a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando ("Protection Command"). Hitler wanted a small group of tough ex-soldiers like Schreck, who would be loyal to him. The unit included old Stoßtrupp members like Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The unit made its first public appearance in April 1925. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national level. It was also successively renamed the Sturmstaffel ("Storm Squadron") and then finally the Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) on 9 November 1925. Schreck became SS member #5. He was asked by Hitler to command the bodyguard company. Schreck never referred to himself as Reichsführer-SS, but the title was retroactively applied <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> later years.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his later activities.|$|E

5|$|After {{managing}} England, Ramsey briefly held football-related roles at Birmingham City and Panathinaikos, {{before retiring}} in 1979–80. He led a somewhat reclusive life in Ipswich {{over the next two}} decades and died in 1999, aged 79. A statue of Ramsey was dedicated at the reconstructed Wembley Stadium in 2009, and various honours have been afforded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Ipswich. He is the first person to have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame twice: an inaugural inductee in 2002, in recognition of his achievements as a manager and admitted again in 2010 for his achievements as a player. He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.|$|E
5|$|Also in Paris in April Cochet {{failed to}} capture the International Championships title {{dropping}} it to Marcel Bernard. In the 1948–49 International Christmas Tournament of Barcelona Cochet met Masip in the doubles final, where the Spanish team of Masip-Carles granted a walkover to Cochet and Australian Jack Harper. In April 1949 Cochet knocked out Masip from the Paris International Tournament in the quarterfinals. They joined forces for the doubles contest, which they subsequently won. In May he faced Masip again in the championships match of the British Hard Court Championships, and lost <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> four sets. In August he was a singles and doubles finalist in the International Championships of Istanbul. In singles he was overcome by Gottfried von Cramm and in doubles by von Cramm and Harper. In December he finally acquired the Barcelona title by beating Harper in five sets.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E
