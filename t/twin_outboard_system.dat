50|$|Hydrodyne {{produced}} {{many different}} hulls ranging from small runabouts {{all the way}} up to house boats. Hydrodyne is mostly remembered for its signature Ski boats that ran <b>twin</b> <b>outboards</b> in many ski shows throughout the 1960s through the 1990s. A few manufacturers, specifically Tom Miller Boats and Dyna-Ski boat company still make the 18 foot and 20 foot models that can accept up to 3 outboard motors.|$|R
25|$|Contrary to Japanese Shinyo motorboats, MT boats, though very {{dangerous}} {{to use in}} combat, were not designed as suicide weapons: The pilot, installed over the transom had a crude ejector seat and after bailing out, the seat acted as a miniature raft to keep the pilot {{out of the water}} and immune from the lethal shock of the underwater explosion. Another very innovative design was the Isotta-Fraschini Z-drive transmission system, featuring an inboard engine and <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> contra-rotating propellers.|$|R

50|$|The most {{successful}} early outboard motor, {{was created by}} Norwegian-American inventor Ole Evinrude in 1909. Between 1909 and 1912, Evinrude made thousands of his outboards and the three horse units were sold around the world. His Evinrude Outboard Co. was spun off to other owners, {{and he went on}} to success after starting the ELTO company to produce a two-cylinder motor - ELTO stood for Evinrude Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard.</b> The 1920s were the first high-water mark for the outboard with Evinrude, Johnson, ELTO, Atwater Lockwood and dozens of other makers in the field.|$|R

5000|$|Because of Bessie's poor health, the Evinrudes {{sold their}} company in 1913, and Ole agreed to not {{re-enter}} the outboard motor business for five years. His inventive mind kept busy, however, and during his [...] "retirement", he devised a much-improved, two-cylinder outboard engine. In 1921 he and Bessie formed the ELTO Outboard Motor Company (ELTO standing for Evinrude's Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard).</b> This new outboard engine {{was also very}} successful, and in 1929 the ELTO company merged with the original Evinrude company (since renamed the Outboard Marine Corporation) and the Lockwood Motor Company, with Evinrude the president of this new company.|$|R

50|$|By 1921, Evinrude {{was back}} in business, in a venture he called the ELTO Outboard Motor Company. His new {{offering}} was the Evinrude Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard,</b> a motor partly made of aluminum, reducing its weight by a third. Popular with the fishing fleets, this revolutionary engine outstripped sales of Evinrude's original outboard motor within three years. It also {{attracted the attention of}} a competitor, Johnson Motor Company, which brought out its rival lightweight engine in 1922. Johnson gained market share, snatching the lead four years later with an updated model weighing a trim 100 pounds, costing a thrifty $190, and able to drive a boat at a zippy 16 miles per hour. Neither the Evinrude Company nor ELTO could match this. Now far ahead, Johnson produced a net profit of $433,000 in 1927, far outpacing Evinrude's $25,000 and ELTO's $30,000.|$|R

50|$|The {{resulting}} module, {{named the}} Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110, {{consisted of a}} transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters. The initial modules were delivered to Air Montserrat in 1987 and were very well received - as a result, Air London ordered several the following year. The ISA 110 was subsequently sold as an <b>outboard</b> <b>system.</b> The ISA130 {{was added to the}} range in 1988, a single-channel Comp/Limiter, De-Esser and Expander/Gate developed by Rupert Neve and Trevor Stride.|$|R

5000|$|The 25 ft (8 m) Transportable Port Security Boat (TPSB): (AKA The Guardian) is a <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> motor, open deck, all weather, high performance, moderately-armed {{platform}} {{capable of}} operating in inner harbor/near shore environments in light sea conditions. It was first built in FY97 by Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida, for the US Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistic Command. The 25 ft (8 m) TPSB is designed and configured to support Port Security Units as an inshore/harbor surface interdiction response asset {{in accordance with}} Required Operational Capabilities (ROC) and Projected Operational Environment (POE) for Coast Guard Port Security Units (PSU), COMDTINST 3501.49 (series). The basic design {{is based on the}} standard Boston Whaler 25 ft (8 m) Guardian hull, customized to functionally suit the TPSB mission requirements. The basic craft arrangements consist of a centrally positioned control console and leaning post with an open work deck and low non-obstructive gunwales. The TPSB is outfitted as a military gunboat with three (3) hardened weapon positions: (1) forward [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) tri-pod, (2) gunwale - mounted 7.62 mm M240B Machine Gun pipe pedestals, port and starboard.|$|R
50|$|ISA 110 Mic Pre & Equalizer (1987/89) The {{original}} ISA 110 module {{was designed}} by Rupert Neve to be vertically mounted and fit into the existing rack format of the Neve console at George Martin’s Air Montserrat studio. It consisted of a transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier based around a transformer supplied by Lundahl of Sweden, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters and was named the Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110. The design {{was based on the}} 31106 EQ module designed for the A7971 console by Rupert Neve, incorporating suggestions from Sir George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick. The first modules were delivered in 1987. The ISA 110 was subsequently made publicly available as an <b>outboard</b> <b>system</b> consisting of rack, external power supply and ISA module, which sold for approximately $7,000 US.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{length of}} the hull is 25 feet and the boat is officially {{referred}} to as such. However, the overall length with engines mounted is approximately 29 ft. Powered by <b>twin</b> [...] <b>outboard</b> motors, {{they are capable of}} speeds in excess of 46 kn and have a range of 150 to 175 nmi km, depending on the class. The boat requires a minimum crew of two persons, but has a carrying capacity for 10 persons. The boat is easily trailerable and can be transported by a C-130 Hercules aircraft or truck.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic 75-class {{superseded}} the Atlantic 21-class. The name Atlantic {{is derived}} from Atlantic College in Wales, where the rigid inflatable B-class was first developed. The designation 75 {{is derived from}} its length of nearly 7.5 m. A significant improvement to this class over the 21 is {{the addition of a}} ballast tank installed {{at the front of the}} lifeboat which enables the craft to launch into larger surf than the previous class. The ballast when full, either of sea water or water from a hose, weighs the same as three fully grown men. The lifeboat has a crew of three and has a top speed of 32 kn and can operated in severe weather conditions up to winds of near gale force. The design incorporates <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> engines which are completely waterproofed, even if totally immersed. The hull of the lifeboat is constructed from Glass Reinforced plastic with a hypalon coated polyester which is highly resistant attack by marine organisms, chemicals and temperature extremes. The lifeboat had a displacement of 1.6 tonnes. Her equipment included two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, anchor and various warps, toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches. The rollbar assembly installed above the engines contains a self-righting bag which was operated by a member of the crew activating a gas bottle.|$|R

A new 27’ Safe Boat patrol vessel, powered by <b>twin</b> 250 {{horsepower}} <b>outboard</b> motors, {{is equipped with}} a 360 degree infrared camera and provides EnCon Police Officers with all weather capability for enforcement and search & rescue missions on Long Island Sound.|$|R
40|$|Three {{station keeping}} {{controllers}} {{have been developed}} which work to minimize displacement of a small outboard-powered vessel from a desired location. Each of these three controllers has a common initial layer that uses fixed-gain feedback control to calculate the desired heading of the vessel. A second control layer uses a common fixed-gain feedback controller to calculate the net forward thrust, one of two algorithms for controlling engine angle (Fixed-Gain Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) or PID with Adaptively Augmented Gains), and one of two algorithms for differential throttle control (Fixed-Gain PID and PID with Adaptive Differential Throttle gains), which work together to eliminate heading error. The three selected controllers are evaluated using a numerical simulation of a 33 -foot center console vessel with <b>twin</b> <b>outboards</b> that is subject to wave, wind, and current disturbances. Each controller is tested {{for its ability to}} maintain position in the presence of three sets of environmental disturbances. These algorithms were tested with current velocity of 1. 5 m/s, significant wave height of 0. 5 m, and wind speeds of 2, 5, and 10 m/s. These values were chosen to model conditions a small vessel may experience in the Gulf Stream off of Fort Lauderdale. The Fixed-gain PID controller progressively got worse as wind speeds increased, while the controllers using adaptive methodologies showed consistent performance over all weather conditions and decreased heading error by as much as 20 %. Thus, enhanced robustness to environmental changes has been gained by using an adaptive algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Flying wings lack {{anywhere}} to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly {{on to the}} rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate {{the advantages of the}} flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing <b>twin</b> fins <b>outboard</b> near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, marginal stability.|$|R

All the tail surfaces have trim tabs and are horn balanced.|$|R
25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with <b>twin</b> rudders placed <b>outboard</b> of the propeller arc).|$|R
50|$|The biplane {{featured}} a steel tube fuselage, and aluminum covered wings. The fuselage was fabric covered only to behind the cockpit, leaving {{the rest of}} the tail structure exposed, preventing dust buildup in the tail. The aircraft had <b>twin</b> rudders mounted <b>outboard</b> of the spray trail. Each of these were all-moving with anti-servo tabs. Standard automotive wheels and tires were employed to reduce cost as low-cost World War II surplus was becoming too old, and new aviation tires cost nearly five times as much.|$|R
