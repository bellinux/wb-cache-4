5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very low on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> bent over {{so far in}} his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

25|$|Hughes batted with an {{orthodox}} upright, side-on stance. He gripped the bat high on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> played his strokes with a controlled backlift {{and a full}} follow through.

25|$|His biggest {{contribution}} to the game of field hockey was the 'half push- half hit'- a stroke he used {{to hit the ball}} using the same grip used to dribble the ball. With the left hand on top of <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> the right half low down around the centre of the stick he used to essay this shot with a minimum back lift and slam the ball towards his partner-teammate to make an early and accurate pass. The same stroke was adapted by his successor Dhanraj Pillay, who was an ardent fan of the maestro. Earlier the stroke or technique did not exist in a field hockey player's repertoire or in the game's coaching manual.|$|E
25|$|The blade is {{connected}} to a long cylindrical cane handle, {{similar to that of}} a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, by means of a splice. The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break {{at the corner of the}} join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> avoids this problem.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when the Israelites had settled in the land, they were to divide the land into three parts and set aside three Cities of Refuge, so that any manslayer could have a place to which to flee. And if the Israelites faithfully observed all the law and God enlarged the territory, then they were to add three more towns to those three. Only a manslayer who had killed another unwittingly, without being the other's enemy, might flee there and live. For instance, if a man went with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood, and as he swung an axe, the axe-head flew off <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> struck and killed the neighbor, then the man could flee to one of the cities of refuge and live. The second open portion ends here.|$|E

25|$|Nine {{months after}} the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo {{travelled}} by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses {{in the village of}} Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot. Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip. Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E
500|$|Three Golden Gun props were made; a solid piece, {{one that}} could be fired with a cap and {{one that could}} be {{assembled}} and disassembled, although Christopher Lee said that the process [...] "was extremely difficult." [...] The gun was [...] "one of the more memorable props in the Bond series" [...] and consisted of an interlocking fountain pen (the barrel), cigarette lighter (the bullet chamber), cigarette case (<b>the</b> <b>handle)</b> <b>and</b> cufflink (the trigger) with the bullet secured in Scaramanga's belt buckle. In the film, the gun was designed to accept a single 4.2-millimeter, 23-carat gold bullet produced by Lazar, a gunsmith in Macau who specialized in custom weapons and ammunition. The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll {{of the most popular}} film weapons, which surveyed approximately 2,000 film fans.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{was seen}} as a stylish and elegant batsman, with a genius for timing and placement. His {{footwork}} was light and his supple wrists allowed him to steer the ball square and late. He held the bat high on <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> his cover drive was executed with balletic grace. He {{was seen as}} possessing the comely movement and keenness of eye of the great batsman of cricket's Golden Age, Victor Trumper. Bradman described Jackson as [...] "tall and slim, rather lethargic and graceful in his movements". Jackson professed [...] a love of applying the maximum velocity to the ball with a minimum of effort. His one identifiable fault was an occasional failing outside off-stump, being prone to unnecessarily dab at away-swingers and being caught in the slips cordon.|$|E
500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E
500|$|The handle {{material}} of the CQC-6 {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double detent as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with a ratchet lock. [...] Titanium bolsters make up the front half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. [...] The screws in <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>and</b> pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. [...] Most models feature traction grooves for a more secure grip in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. [...] A pocket clip {{held in place by}} three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.|$|E
