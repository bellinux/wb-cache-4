500|$|It is {{not clear}} that, with {{possible}} Douglas opposition, Thomas obtained possession of the bishopric smoothly. There is a mandate, dated 5 September 1415, to the subdean of Glasgow Cathedral, ordering the latter to protect [...] "Thomas and his successors in possession of the lands and heredities of Innermasan, Dyrmor, Innysmocrinyl, Kykkenot, Mirtum and Nicoltum in Candida Casa [...] diocese ... which are being molested". No more of such problems are heard. Thomas is next found testifying to an inspeximus at Perth on 17 March 1416. This was made by Bishop Henry de Wardlaw of St Andrews on {{the request of the}} Council of Constance, a sign of the waning loyalty in Scotland and perhaps in Thomas to the Avignon papacy. Bishop Thomas appears to have been suffering ailing health by 1420. In this year he failed to attend a provincial council of the Scottish church at Perth, although he did sent a proctor. He died at some point between 16 July 1420 (date of the council) and 4 December 1422, when Alexander Vaus, Bishop of Caithness, was <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Thomas' successor as Bishop of Galloway. Professor Donald Watt believes that his death probably occurred sometime in 1422.|$|E
2500|$|In Weaver's method, {{the band}} of {{interest}} is first <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> centered at zero, conceptually by modulating a complex exponential [...] with frequency {{in the middle of}} the voiceband, but implemented by a quadrature pair of sine and cosine modulators at that frequency (e.g. 2kHz). [...] This complex signal or pair of real signals is then lowpass filtered to remove the undesired sideband that is not centered at zero. [...] Then, the single-sideband complex signal centered at zero is upconverted to a real signal, by another pair of quadrature mixers, to the desired center frequency.|$|E

[...] Alter argued that the yellow or orange coloring would be {{in keeping with the}} brilliantly dyed stuff in [...] Professor Richard Elliott Friedman of the University of Georgia wrote that no one knows what the term means, noting that it has been <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dolphin skins, badger skins, goatskins, and skins of a particular color. Friedman wrote that it is a cognate of an Arabic word for dolphin, but, since it does not occur in the list of animals that are forbidden or permitted for food in [...] it may not refer to a particular species of animal at all. Friedman concluded that it may just mean tanned skins or leather.|$|E
