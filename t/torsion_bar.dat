5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one {{on each side of the}} cockpit. Further innovations included <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
25|$|Also {{familiar}} from {{a succession}} of post war Panhard saloons was the four-speed all-synchromesh gear box and the front-wheel-drive configuration. The wheels were independently suspended with telescopic shock absorbers and a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> for the rear axle.|$|E
25|$|The DeLorean solved these {{problems}} {{by using a}} solid-steel <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> (supplied by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation) to counterbalance a full-sized door and then used simple pneumatic struts {{similar to those found}} in hatchback cars to open the doors and damp their movement.|$|E

50|$|Front {{suspension}} was MacPherson-like with <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> {{instead of}} springs, to allow {{room for the}} wide V6 and the optional air conditioning. The height of the front suspension is adjustable, using eccentric cams in {{the ends of the}} <b>torsion</b> <b>bars,</b> where they are attached to the body.|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{consists of}} five sets of double road wheels with <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> springs. The {{system does not}} have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork road wheels were used.|$|E
25|$|The T20 used {{an early}} version of the {{horizontal}} volute spring suspension (HVSS), another improvement compared to the less robust vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) of the early versions of the M4. Later prototypes of the M26 tested a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension, which would become the standard for future U.S. tank suspension systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{firmness}} of the suspension, {{and thus}} {{the quality of the}} ride, was gradually softened through the years as well, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. Interestingly, a heavy-duty suspension was offered optionally on later first generation Toronados, which included the original <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> springs that were used on the 1966.|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> for the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM {{passenger car}} application of <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used <b>torsion</b> <b>bars</b> in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|R

25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar.</b> To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.|$|E
25|$|The Arjun {{features}} a hydro-pneumatic suspension. This {{coupled with the}} Arjun's stabilisation and fire control system allows the tank excellent first-hit probability against moving targets while on the move. Its ride comfort is highly praised. Though on the negative side, it is a more maintenance-intensive and expensive system, even if more capable than the simpler and cheaper <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> system utilised on many older tanks worldwide. During trials, the Arjun showcased its fording capability, by driving under 1.8 metres of water for 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E

25|$|All was {{not well}} financially and the {{receiver}} was called in 1935, but the company was bought by Alan P. Good, who just outbid Rolls-Royce. He also persuaded W. O. Bentley to leave Rolls-Royce and join Lagonda as designer along with many of his racing department staff. The 4.5-litre range now became the LG45 with lower but heavier bodies and also available in LG45R Rapide form. The LG45 came in three versions known as Sanction 1, 2 and 3 each with more Bentley touches to the engine. In 1938 the LG6 with independent front suspension by <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> and hydraulic brakes came in.|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light tank {{uses the}} <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> {{suspension}} {{which consists of}} five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap {{between the first and}} second road wheel and an even space between second, third, fourth and fifth road wheel. The road wheels are smaller and lighter than those from the Type 59 main battle tank. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the rear, with an idler at the front. There are no return rollers. In effort to reduce the overall weight of the tank the original 12150L 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine from Type 59 main battle tank was powered down from 523hp (390kW) to 430hp (321kW). This modified version of the 12150L engine weights considerably less and was designated 12150L-3. This new engine gave the Type 62 a maximum road speed of 60km/h, maximum cross country speed of 35km/h, maximum road operational range of 500km and power-to-weight ratio of 20.5hp/tonne (15.3kW/tonne). The tank can cross 0.8 m high vertical obstacles, 2.85 m trenches, 30° side slopes and ford 1.4 m deep water obstacles (5 m when equipped with a snorkel).|$|E

25|$|During the {{development}} of this vehicle, the ABTU proposed to mount the large, high velocity 152mm cannon on the T-100 in order to give it the capacity to destroy bunkers and other strong fixed fortifications. The plant manager at N°185 proposed to stop {{the development}} of the prototype to use T-100 as a self-propelled gun armed with the 100 and 130mm naval guns. This idea was accepted and on January 8, 1940, the plans of the T-100-X were finalized and sent to the Izhorskyi factory. The T-100-X had a box-shaped fighting compartment and was equipped with the 130mm B-13 naval gun. For mobility, kept the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension system, as was the trend in modern tanks of the day. During {{the development of}} the prototype the shape of the fighting compartment was modified to reduce ammunition loading times. The new design was the SU-100Y (sometimes called T-100 there). The designs of the SU-100Y were sent to the Izhorskyi factory on February 24, 1940 and assembly began on the first of the month. The self-propelled gun was tested {{for the first time on}} March 14. As the Winter War was finished, the SU-100Y never saw combat.|$|E
500|$|The chassis had {{originally}} been designed with a six-wheeled Schachtellaufwerk interleaved-roadwheel suspension (as German half-tracks had already adopted), but the German Army amended this to a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> system. Permitting greater vertical deflection of the roadwheels, this was intended to improve performance and crew comfort both on- and off-road. However, due to the urgent requirement for the new tank, neither proposal was adopted, and Krupp instead equipped it with a simple leaf spring double-bogie suspension, with eight rubber-rimmed [...] roadwheels per side.|$|E
500|$|The TAM's engine {{requirements}} included low {{weight and}} volume, {{but with a}} fast rate of acceleration and high reliability. [...] The program chose MTU's MB-833 Ka 500 diesel engine, producing [...] at 2,400rpm. [...] This gives the TAM a power-to-weight ratio of 24horsepowerpertonne and a maximum speed of [...] onroad and [...] off-road. [...] With a [...] internal fuel tank, the TAM can travel [...] Its range is extended to [...] if the vehicle is equipped with two [...] external fuel tanks. [...] The TAM's transmission is a Renk HSWL-204 automatic, with a hydrodynamic torque converter. [...] A double brake system includes hydraulic disk brakes on the roadwheels, and the suspension is a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

500|$|Like all German tanks, the Tiger II had a petrol engine; in {{this case}} the same 700 PS (690hp, 515kW) V-12 Maybach HL 230 P30 which powered the much lighter Panther and Tiger I tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and {{consumed}} a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped [...] diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, the WEU defence {{workgroup}} FINBEL (named after France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg), {{founded in}} 1953 and consisting of {{representatives of the}} various General Staffs, drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into FINABEL (the added [...] "A" [...] standing for Allemagne, [...] "Germany" [...] in French) and on 27 October 1956 at Colomb-Béchar a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank. Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate, the type was called Europa-Panzer to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries {{were involved in the}} design process. The specifications (FINABEL 3A5) for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to [...] and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle. French and German engineers, during a conference in Bonn on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank. This included a maximum width of , a height of [...] and a [...] tank gun, to be developed by the Franco-German military research institute at Saint Louis. The new tank would have an air-cooled, petrol engine, a <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> suspension with hydraulic shocks, a power-to-weight ratio of at least /metric ton and a road range of at least [...] In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus. That same year, on 28 November, the French and German ministries of defence in Paris agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately. The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when Charles de Gaulle took power in France, creating the Fifth Republic: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common nuclear weapon and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the USA and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.|$|E
500|$|Development {{of the new}} {{tank was}} offered to five {{separate}} manufacturers: Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX), Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM), Renault, Societe Lorraine de Dietrich (SLD-Lorraine) and Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (SOMUA). The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the <b>torsion</b> <b>bar</b> sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|E
