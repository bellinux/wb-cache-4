50|$|The {{timetable}} {{system has}} several disadvantages. First, {{there is no}} positive confirmation that the track ahead is clear, only that it {{is scheduled to be}} clear. The system does not allow for engine failures and other such problems, but the timetable is set up so that there should be sufficient <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>trains</b> for the crew of a failed or delayed train to walk far enough to set warning flags, flares, and detonators or torpedoes (UK and US terminology, respectively) to alert any other train crew.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{locomotives}} may {{easily be}} constructed with greater power output than most diesel locomotives. For passenger operation {{it is possible}} to provide enough power with diesel engines (see e.g. 'ICE TD') but, at higher speeds, this proves costly and impractical. Therefore, almost all high speed trains are electric.The high power of electric locomotives also gives them the ability to pull freight at higher speed over gradients; in mixed traffic conditions this increases capacity when the <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>trains</b> can be decreased. The higher power of electric locomotives and an electrification can also be a cheaper alternative to a new and less steep railway if trains weights are to be increased on a system.|$|E

5000|$|The Wenshan Line is {{connected}} to the Neihu Line, which opened in July 2009. It connects to Neihu and Taipei Songshan Airport, which currently has no rapid transit access. Since an alternative contractor Bombardier was awarded to supply the rolling stock and the signaling system for the new line, the Wenshan Line's signaling system was converted to suit the new communication-based train control (CBTC) CITYFLO 650 to allow both the old Matra rolling stock and the new Bombardier rolling stock to run in co-existence. [...] On December 19, 2010, fifty-one pairs of retrofitted VAL256's (from the Matra rolling stock) will begin testing on the entire line. After over half a year of testing, the additional trains will decrease the <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>trains</b> at rush hour from 2 minutes to 72 seconds and bring the total number of trains operating on the line to 152 pairs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBased on the {{analysis}} of the railway system in the Paris region in France, this paper presents a rescheduling problem in which stops on train lines can be skipped and services are retimed to recover when limited disturbances occur. Indeed, in such mass transit systems, minor disturbances tend to propagate and generate larger delays through the shared use of resources, if no action is quickly taken. An integrated Integer Linear Programming model is presented whose objective function minimizes both the recovery time and the waiting time of passengers. Additional criteria related to the weighted number of train stops that are skipped are included in the objective function. Rolling-stock constraints are also taken into account to propose a feasible plan. Computational experiments on real data are conducted to show the impact of rescheduling decisions depending on key parameters such as the duration of the disturbances and the minimal turning <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>trains.</b> The trade-off between the different criteria in the objective function is also illustrated and discussed...|$|E
30|$|Examples 2, 3 and 4 {{consider}} {{a situation in}} which the agents are not allowed for side payments. In these cases the improvement of the solution is obtained through a bargaining procedure among the agents. In order to have a simple graphical representation of the strategies and of the utilities of the agents, we restrict to two-agent situations, being aware that this excludes intermediate coalitions and consequently, the outside opportunities do not play any role. The data set, i.e. the requirements of the agents are the same in all three examples, but introducing different “real” utility functions we analyze three possible situations: in Example 2 the agents may improve their utilities with respect to the proposal of the IM and we show three possible alternatives corresponding to the bargaining problem solutions of Nash, Kalai-Smorodinsky and Egalitarian; in Example 3 the agents realize that the proposal of the IM is already Pareto optimal, i.e. it cannot be improved by an agent without a reduction of the utility of the other one; finally, Example 4 shows that under particular utility functions the agents may face {{a situation in which}} the bargaining region is non-convex, in contrast with the classical literature. The situation of Example 4 allows us to propose some non-standard approaches to this kind of problems. In all the examples we assume that the headway <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>trains</b> is at least two minutes.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} {{results in}} greater gains in physical strength and muscular growth, {{but there are}} limits. An excess of training stimuli {{can lead to the}} problem of overtraining. Overtraining is the decline in training performance {{over the course of a}} training program, often increasing the risk of illness or injury or decreased desire to exercise. In order to help avoid this problem, the technique of periodization is applied. Periodization in the context of fitness or strength training programs is the scheduling of provisions for adequate recovery <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>training</b> sessions, variety over the course of a long-term program and motivation - avoiding monotony when repeating identical exercise routines.|$|R
