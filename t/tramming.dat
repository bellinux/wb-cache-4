25|$|As {{soon as the}} Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took control}} of the mine in 1936 urgent repair work was done on both Smith's Shaft and Murray's Shaft. The 150Fathom Level had flooded and needed to be pumped out, and roof falls on other levels needed {{clearing}}. After buying the mine in 1937 the Lucy Tongue Level was refurbished. Roof falls needed clearing and retimbering, the worst of the sharp bends were straightened out, and some narrow stone-arched sections were rebuilt. All the rails were replaced, as was the nearly fifty-year-old locomotive, and new side-tipping wagons were introduced. At the same time Murray's Shaft was deepened and a new 175Fathom Level was begun from the bottom. A small battery locomotive was installed for <b>tramming</b> on that level. Horses were still used on the other levels, but in time they too were replaced by battery locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so <b>tramming</b> had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E

50|$|On a Trammed Canvas {{the design}} is professionally {{stitched}} onto the canvas by hand using horizontal stitches of varying lengths of wool of the appropriate colours. The canvas is usually sold together with the wool required to stitch the trammed area. The stitcher then uses tent stitch over the horizontal lines with the tramme stitches acting as an accurate guide as to the colour and number of stitches required. This technique is particularly suited to designs with a large area of mono-colour background as such areas do not require <b>tramming,</b> reducing {{the cost of the}} canvas and allowing the stitcher to choose the background colour themselves. The Portuguese island of Madeira is the historic centre for the manufacture of trammed canvases.|$|E
50|$|The Syndicate {{expected}} Timwood {{to be its}} prize asset. It was {{the only}} mine {{at the foot of}} the Brendons, aiming to do on a grand scale what some mines had done on a smaller scale at the top, i.e. drill horizontally into the hillside (or even better, drill at a gentle upward slope to drain water and assist <b>tramming</b> ore and waste) until it encountered veins of ore previously worked from above at Carew and Raleigh's Cross mines. This approach had been suggested but not tried in 1854. It sought to reduce the cost and effort involved in pumping water and raising ore to the surface only to lower it down again using the incline to Comberow. It came at the price of having to drill much further to reach ore and carried an increased risk of not reaching ore at all.|$|E
