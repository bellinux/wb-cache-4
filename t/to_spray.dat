5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|On most crude-oil tankers, {{a special}} crude oil washing (COW) system {{is part of}} the {{cleaning}} process. The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match pitted Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell, against Abyss. Abyss attempted to use a steel chair wrapped in barbed wire during the bout, but was stopped and it was taken away by the referee. Near the end, Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mesias, however Mitchell distracted the referee from counting the pinfall. This allowed Mesias <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> red mist in Abyss' face and then follow by slamming Abyss face-first into the steel chair wrapped in barb-wire with his signature Straight to Hell maneuver at eleven minutes and three seconds.|$|E
40|$|The within-field spatial {{distribution}} of beneficial arthropods was assessed using twodimensional grids of pitfall traps and suction sampling across two winter wheat fields of 4 and 16 ha, before and after an application of dimethoate. An unsprayed 6 m wide buffer zone was left around half {{the edge of the}} larger field. Arthropod numbers fluctuated to varying extents prior <b>to</b> <b>spraying.</b> Two species of Carabidae (Pterostichus madidus and P. melanarius), Linyphiidae, Lycosidae and Aphidius spp. (Braconidae) all showed their greatest reduction after spraying. For five carabid taxa, Tachyporus spp. (Staphylinidae) and Collembola the decline in numbers following spraying was no greater than any reduction found during the pre-spraying period. Within field {{spatial distribution}}s of three arthropod groups were analysed using SADIE. P. madidus, present in patches across the centre of both fields prior <b>to</b> <b>spraying,</b> was removed by dimethoate and by 34 days after spraying had recovered most at the field edges. Linyphiidae were evenly distributed across both fields prior <b>to</b> <b>spraying.</b> Their numbers were reduced considerably by dimethoate and they did not recover to pre-spray levels. However, where recovery occurred this was across the centre of both fields indicating theirpotential to reinvade whole fields. Aphidius species were also evenly distributed across both fields prior <b>to</b> <b>spraying,</b> but did not recover after spraying. Some, but not all arthropods survived within the unsprayed buffer zone and there was some indication that reinvasion of the mid-field was more extensive where this was present. The importance of field margins with respect to insecticide treatments is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E

5|$|The soldier caste has {{anatomical}} and behavioural specialisations, {{and their}} sole {{purpose is to}} defend the colony. Many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged they cannot feed themselves. Instead, like juveniles, they are fed by workers. Fontanelles, simple holes in the forehead that exude defensive secretions, are {{a feature of the}} family Rhinotermitidae. Many species are readily identified using the characteristics of the soldiers' larger and darker head and large mandibles. Among certain termites, soldiers may use their globular (phragmotic) heads to block their narrow tunnels. Different sorts of soldiers include minor and major soldiers, and nasutes, which have a horn-like nozzle frontal projection (a nasus). These unique soldiers are able <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> noxious, sticky secretions containing diterpenes at their enemies. Nitrogen fixation {{plays an important role in}} nasute nutrition.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised <b>to</b> <b>spray</b> in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{regulations}} in British Columbia prohibit the practice of exposing police <b>to</b> pepper <b>spray</b> in training. Previous research indicates that pepper spray exposure does not cause serious health problems; that traditional training methods are inadequate; and that exposing police <b>to</b> pepper <b>spray</b> in training enhances officer safety in the field. This study explored how exposure <b>to</b> pepper <b>spray</b> in training affects officer safety. To accomplish this, patrol and traffic personnel from independent municipal police forces in British Columbia were surveyed and interviewed. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed that exposure <b>to</b> pepper <b>spray</b> in training enhances the physical performance, decision making, confidence, and knowledge of police when they are exposed in the field; enhances officer safety during non-sanctioned exposures; and does not cause serious health problems. These findings suggest that police training should feature exposure {{to a variety of}} less-lethal weapons...|$|R
