40|$|AbstractShort-term {{exercise}} {{has been}} associated with increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor, a potent dilating and natriuretic hormone. In this study, the effect of exercise training on atrial natriuretic factor release during short-term exercise was investigated in men without a history of cardiovascular or other major disease. A well trained group of 10 men who exercised an average of 6, 618 kcal/week was compared with a minimally trained group of 9 men who exercised 1, 479 kcal/week. Maximal oxygen uptake was 55. 2 ml/kg per min in the well trained group and 42. 5 ml/kg per min in the minimally trained group (p < 0. 05). Plasma for atrial natriuretic factor, norepinephrine and epinephrine was obtained at rest, at 4 min of exercise and at maximal exercise. Atrial natriuretic factor was lower at rest in the minimally trained than in the well <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> (23 vs. 35. 9 pg/ml, p < 0. 05). At maximal exercise, atrial natriuretic factor increased 2. 6 times the value at rest in minimally <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> (59. 8 pg/ml, p < 0. 05 vs. rest), but did not change in well <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> (34 pg/ml). In minimally <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> at rest, at 4 min of exercise and at maximal exercise, plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with heart rate, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine; these correlations were not found in the well trained group. Thus, short-term exercise results in a significant increase in atrial natriuretic factor in minimally trained but not in well <b>trained</b> <b>men.</b> This increase correlates with physiologic variables that reflect increased sympathetic activity in the minimally trained but not the well trained group. Thus, in well <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> there appears to be an increased stimulus for atrial natriuretic factor release at rest, but an uncoupling of the stimuli for its release during exercise...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to (a) modify previously published Vo(2) max equations using the constant error (CE = mean difference between actual and predicted Vo(2) max) values from Malek et al. (28); (b) cross-validate the modified equations to determine their accuracy for estimating Vo(2) max in aerobically trained men; (c) derive a new non- exercise-based equation for estimating Vo(2) max in aerobically <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> if the modified equations are not found to be accurate; and (d) cross-validate the new Vo(2) max equation using the predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) statistic and an independent sample of aerobically <b>trained</b> <b>men.</b> One hundred and fifty-two aerobically <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> (Vo(2) max mean +/- SD = 4, 154 +/- 629 ml. min(- 1)) performed a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer to determine actual Vo(2) max. An aerobically <b>trained</b> <b>man</b> was defined as someone who had participated in continuous aerobic exercise 3 or more sessions per week for a minimum of 1 hour per session for at least the past 18 months. Nine previously published Vo(2) max equations were modified for use with aerobically <b>trained</b> <b>men.</b> The predicted Vo(2) max values from the 9 modified equations were compared to actual Vo(2) max by examining the CE, standard error of estimate (SEE), validity coefficient (r), and total error (TE). Cross-validation of the modified non-exercise-based equations on a random subsample of 50 subjects resulted in a...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} has proven benefits for {{physical and psychological}} well-being and is associated with reduced responsiveness to physical stress. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent physical activity also modulates the responsiveness to psychosocial stress. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether the reduced responsiveness to physical stressors that has been observed in <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> can be generalized to the modulation of physiological and psychological responses to a psychosocial stressor. Twenty-two <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> (elite sportsmen) and 22 healthy untrained men were exposed to a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Adrenocortical (salivary free cortisol levels), autonomic (heart rate), and psychological responses (mood, calmness, anxiety) were repeatedly measured before and after stress exposure. In response to the stressor, cortisol levels and heart rate were significantly increased in both groups, without any baseline differences between groups. However, <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> exhibited significantly lower cortisol and heart rate responses to the stressor compared with untrained <b>men.</b> In addition, <b>trained</b> <b>men</b> showed significantly higher calmness and better mood, and a trend toward lower state anxiety during the stress protocol. On the whole, elite sportsmen showed reduced reactivity to the psychosocial stressor, characterized by lower adrenocortical, autonomic, and psychological stress responses. These results suggest that physical activity may provide a protective effect against stress-related disorders...|$|R
