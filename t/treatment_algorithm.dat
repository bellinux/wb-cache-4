There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To compare {{clinical}} outcomes obtained using <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithms</b> versus standard “usual care ” to treat patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} in a community setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — An observational group comparison was implemented in three community-based clinics in San Antonio, Texas: 1) a community clinic following <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithms</b> (CC-TA), 2) university clinic following <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithms</b> (UC-TA), and 3) a community clinic following standard “usual care ” practices (CC-SC). Three hundred fifty-eight recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (90 % Mexican American, from low-income neighborhoods) who were consecutively identified at the three clinics were re-cruited. Following medical and laboratory evaluation, participants were started on treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and followed for 12 months. RESULTS — Decrements in HbA 1 c at 12 months in the CC-TA and UC-TA were 3. 1 and 3. 3 %, respectively, compared to 1. 3 % in the CC-SC (P 0. 0001). Corresponding decrements in fasting plasma glucose at 12 months were 94 and 99 mg/dl, respectively, versus 38 mg/dl in CC-SC (P 0. 0001).

40|$|During {{the past}} several years, we have {{achieved}} {{a deeper understanding of}} the etiology/pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD).

One approach to enhancing treatment outcomes in MDD has been the use of standardized sequential <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithms</b> and measurement-based care. Such <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithms</b> stand in contrast to the personalized medicine approach, in which biomarkers would guide decision making.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{evaluated the}} functional and radiological outcomes following {{the implementation of}} a non-operative <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> for skeletally immature children after ACL injury. The body of evidence, needed for future experimental studies to investigate the effect of different treatment algorithms in this population, has been strengthened. New knowledge has been provided to assist clinical decision making. An evidence-based <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> has been developed, and the current methodological quality of the literature on the treatment of skeletally immature children has been investigated. The main conclusions which may have an impact on future clinical practice and research were: I. The methodological quality of the literature on treatment of skeletally immature children after ACL injury was low. In particular we identified a lack of properly sized prospective cohort studies on homogenous populations, few studies including functional outcome measurements, an absence of descriptions of rehabilitation protocols and valid outcome measurements, as well as no randomised clinical trials on the effect of different treatment modalities (Paper II). II. Patient-reported and performance-based outcome measurements did not show clinical relevant changes in knee function in ACL injured skeletally immature children following a non-operative <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> (Paper III). III. Skeletally immature children remain physically active following a non-operative <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> after ACL injury, although 38 % of the ACL deficient children abandoned a Level 1 activity as their main leisure time sport activity (Paper III). IV. A low incidence of new injuries to the menisci and articular cartilage was found after implementing a non-operative <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> in ACL injured skeletally immature children (Paper IV) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{differential}} diagnosis {{of pain in}} the mouth can be challenging for general medical practitioners (GMPs) as many different dental problems can present with similar signs and symptoms. This study aimed to create a <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> for GMPs to effectively and appropriately refer the patients and prescribe antibiotics. Design. The study design is comprised of qualitative focus group discussions. Setting and Subjects. Groups of GMPs within the Gold Coast and Brisbane urban and city regions. Outcome Measures. Content thematically analysed and <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> developed. Results. There were 5 focus groups with 8 - 9 participants per group. Addressing whether antibiotics {{should be given to}} patients with dental pain was considered very important to GMPs to prevent overtreatment and creating antibiotic resistance. Many practitioners were unsure of what the different forms of dental pains represent. 90 % of the practitioners involved agreed that the <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> was useful to daily practice. Conclusion. Common dental complaints and infections are seldom surgical emergencies but can result in prolonged appointments for those GMPs who do not regularly deal with these issues. The <b>treatment</b> <b>algorithm</b> for referral processes and prescriptions was deemed easily downloadable and simple to interpret and detailed but succinct enough for clinical use by GMPs...|$|E
