5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak. It blew down in a storm in the early 1990s. A piece of the tree was saved as a memorial and is on display at nearby Pioneer Elementary School in Hanford.|$|E
25|$|A dedicatory inscription, now affixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Vishvanatha temple, {{provides}} {{information about the}} construction of a Shiva temple by the Chandela king Dhanga. The original date of the inscription is read variously as 1056 VS (999 CE) or 1059 VS (1002 CE).|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{steps with}} {{decorative}} wooden railings of solid wood panels pierced by saw-cut quatrefoils {{climb to the}} hip-roofed porch which runs {{the length of the}} first story on the south (front) facade. Immediately east of them another set of steps leads down to the English basement, currently occupied by a small clothing store. The porch roof is supported by square pillars with knee braces at the top and a molded cornice. At the deck, a baluster similar to those on the steps up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> connects the pillars.|$|E
50|$|A terrace {{connects the}} {{southeast}} and northeast facades. It has a stone balustrade and other similar treatments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> on <b>the</b> southeast facade. Atop, a chimney rises from between two dormers.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} {{construction}} of the garage, there have been few other alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> steps have been rebuilt and a handrail added. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> itself has been enclosed.|$|R
50|$|A central hallway {{runs from}} <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>porches</b> extend <b>the</b> entire {{width of the}} house on both {{the first and second}} floors.|$|R
25|$|A fire {{occurred}} at Beaudesert on 5 November 1909 {{and a large}} amount of money was spent by the 6th Marquess in securing the West Front of the estate from the Fitzhugh family and renovating the house and replacing much of what had been done by the predecessors and return to the work conceived by the 3rd Baron Paget. Not a lot of work was done to the exterior of the house except to the west and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> on the east front, which was returned to its 16th-century appearance.|$|E
25|$|It {{closely resembles}} the Yerevan Kiosk. The three doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> are located between the sofas. The façade {{is covered with}} marble, strips of {{porphyry}} and verd antique. The marble panelling of the portico is executed in Cairene Mamluk style. The interior {{is an example of}} an ideal Ottoman room. The recessed shelves and cupboards are decorated with early 16th-century green, yellow and blue tiles. The blue-and-white tiles on the walls are copies of the tiles of the Circumcision Room, right across the terrace. With its tiles dating to the 17th century, mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell decorated cupboard and window panels, this pavilion {{is one of the last}} examples of the classical palace architecture.|$|E
500|$|St Tyfrydog's {{is built}} from rough, small, squared stones, dressed with limestone. The nave {{measures}} about 24feet 9 inches by 23feet 6inches (about 7.5m by 7.2m); the chancel is about 23feet 3inches by 18feet 9inches (about 7.1m by 5.7m). The roof {{is made of}} slate, with a stone bellcote at the west end housing one bell. The roof timbers are visible from inside the church. [...] There are buttresses at {{the east end of}} the nave and at the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|E

25|$|The school {{building}} underwent further renovations <b>to</b> become <b>the</b> Greenville library in 1957. In 1975 <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> was remodeled <b>to</b> resemble <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> on <b>the</b> 1815 building. There {{have been no}} significant alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property since.|$|R
25|$|After 1868 <b>the</b> {{building}} continued <b>to</b> evolve, stucco {{was added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stone {{walls in the}} 1880s and seventy years later wrought iron grill work was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balconies and <b>porches.</b> Galena Avenue was widened in 1965 forcing {{the removal of the}} original front stairs which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lobby <b>porch.</b>|$|R
500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it".|$|E
500|$|Runestone Sö 345 (...) {{was first}} {{documented}} during the national search for historic monuments in 1667, {{and it was}} then used as a doorstep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of Ytterjärna church. It had probably been used for this purpose during a considerable period of time, because according to a drawing that was made a few years later, it was very worn down. In 1830 a church revision noted that it was in a ruined state and so worn that only a few runes remained discernible, and when Hermelin later depicted the stone, he noted that the stone had been cracked in two pieces. In 1896, the runologist Erik Brate visited the stone and discovered that one of the pieces had disappeared and that the only remaining part was reclining on the church wall. The remaining piece measured [...] and [...] The stone has since then been reassembled and raised on the cemetery.|$|E
500|$|There are lancet {{windows in}} the north and south walls and on the tower, some with stone tracery (including the east window in {{the main body of the}} church). [...] The chancel and nave windows are 14th-century and in the Decorated Gothic style common at the time, while the tower windows and bell-openings are smaller and in the Early English style popular in the 13th century, when the tower was built. [...] The largest window, which sits under a hoodmould, is in the east end of the chancel; it is a three-light lancet with {{prominent}} tracery in the curvilinear/reticulated style. [...] The window dates from the 14th century, which may make it the same age as a small window next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> which has twin lights with foliated heads set below a quatrefoil in an ogive arch. [...] Both windows also have scrollwork drip-moulds. [...] Most other windows are plain trefoil-headed single lancets.|$|E
50|$|Other {{rooms on}} the first floor are the dining room, center hall with {{stairways}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor and basement, breakfast room, kitchen, south porch, master bedroom and bathroom. The dining room has two fifteen light doors that lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> breakfast room connects with the dining room through a two-paneled swinging door. The kitchen is off the breakfast room and in the southwest corner of the house. A fifteen light door leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> master bathroom is between a rear hall and the master bedroom.|$|R
5|$|The stone {{addition}} exhibits {{two stories}} of deep verandas extending across its eastern front façade. These verandas were once supported by tall columns rising from <b>the</b> addition's ground-level <b>porch,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof of <b>the</b> second-story <b>porch.</b> An exterior stairway once connected <b>the</b> lower <b>porch</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>porch.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{is built}} in the Beaumanoir style and dates <b>to</b> 1589. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> has twelve empty niches inside and outside are three niches with a statue of Christ placed in the central niche.|$|R
500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.|$|E
500|$|The {{rectangular}} church, {{which has}} been described as [...] "tiny", is said by the Diocese of Bangor to be the second-smallest church in Anglesey. The nave and chancel (which are not divided) measure together 34feet 9inches by 14feet (about 10.6m by 4.3m). The church is constructed of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone and with a foundation of boulders. The roof, which has a bellcote at the west end, is made of slate; the roof timbers can be seen from inside. [...] The only bell, which is dated 1747, is decorated with a vine scroll. The door to the church is on the north side through a porch; the doorway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> has a rounded head and a 15th-century style doorjamb, but the porch itself is more modern. The windows in the nave (one in the north wall, one in the west wall and two in the south wall) have rounded tops. [...] The window at the east end of the church, which dates from the late 16th century, is rectangular with three arched lights (vertical sections) set in a square frame. The lights are separated by mullions and there is an external hoodmould above the window.|$|E
500|$|Conger {{tracked down}} Jett and interrogated him, {{learning}} of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers {{caught up with}} the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, [...] "I prefer to come out and fight." [...] The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive [...] "raised his pistol to shoot" [...] at them. Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth [...] "without order, pretext or excuse," [...] and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, [...] "Tell my mother I died for my country." [...] Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, [...] "Useless, useless," [...] and died as dawn was breaking. In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, [...] "Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment." ...|$|E
50|$|From {{the foyer}} one may enter <b>the</b> {{staircase}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor, turn left {{into a small}} hallway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first-floor <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> living room is accessed via a set of French doors and contains a fireplace and separate exit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first-floor <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> kitchen is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dining room through a butler's pantry area and is also accessible from a narrow hallway with back servant stairway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper floors. Internal access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basement is via the kitchen. There is a small bathroom off the narrow corridor towards {{the back of the}} house.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} very intact {{with only a}} new set of steps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entry <b>porch</b> {{recently}} added approximately 10 years ago.|$|R
50|$|Five steps lead up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entry <b>porch</b> or veranda, at {{the back}} of which is a single central door of glass and aluminium. Original detailing, {{believed}} to be of pressed metal, on the ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> is intact, while the floor features later tiles.|$|R
2500|$|The porch is {{also quite}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of Honington Hall, near Oxford. It is {{possible}} the Honington Hall porch inspired Buckland.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the cloth, a skeleton key, described as looking [...] "well used," [...] was reportedly found on the sidewalk adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> along with a large, almost empty, tube of lipstick. The cloth was analyzed by the authorities, but they found no chemicals on it that could explain Beulah Cordes' reaction.|$|E
2500|$|If one {{compares the}} {{original}} plans of 1892 to {{photographs of the}} existing building in 2014, {{it can be seen}} that the stone cross intended for the roof gable above the chancel has been at some point removed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> gable. The metal cross which was originally fixed atop the bell gable is now fixed on the roof over the chancel. (illustrated below) ...|$|E

50|$|There is a {{historic}} churchyard around the church, which includes several significant tombs. It is wooded, including yew trees beside <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>porch.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The porch, {{dating from}} about 1500, forms the {{entrance}} to the church. [...] It is timber-framed, but most of this is hidden under weatherboarding. [...] The gabled roof, tiled with Horsham stone slabs in common {{with the rest of the}} church roof, has king posts inside. [...] Next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> on the wall of the south aisle, a 16th-century scratch dial, a primitive sundial, is still visible.|$|E
2500|$|The main shrine is {{an example}} of the nagara style: it {{contains}} an entrance porch (ardha-mandapa), a small hall (mandapa), a large hall (maha -mandapa), a vestibule (antarala), and a sanctum (garbhagriha) with a roof tower (shikhara). All these are located on a base with several sculptures. The stairs leading from the base <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> are flanked by lions on one side, and elephants on the other side. The rectangular plan of the main shrine measures [...] x [...]|$|E
2500|$|The tower {{has three}} stages. It is built in rubble with granite {{for the long}} and short quoins, the string course, embattled parapet, and the tall corner pinnacles with crocketted finials. The doorway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{consists}} of the outer order of a Norman doorway which has been moved from elsewhere. It includes zigzag carving and flowers carved in heavy relief. The doorway to the church itself consists of the inner two orders of the Norman doorway with zigzag carving on both orders. [...] On the capitals are carved birds and pine cones.|$|E
5000|$|Depressed, Horgan returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home of Aunt Frances (Barbara Hershey) and {{discovers that}} a handyman, Mackey (Gabriel Byrne), has been hired <b>to</b> fix <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of <b>the</b> main house.
