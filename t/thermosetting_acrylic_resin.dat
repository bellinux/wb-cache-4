It is a quick and energetically efficient technique when curinglarge fiber reinforced parts. Most of the published work onEB-curing deals with curing of thin layers of resin or withcrosslinking of polymers. In this thesis, the curing of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> is studied tohighlight the critical parameters and the particularities ofEB-curing. Tgof the thermoset increases with increasingirradiation dose and levels-off at Tg∞, when the resin is fully cured. As inthermal curing, the temperature during cure strongly affectsthe crosslinking of the resin and the thermo-mechanicalproperties of the cured thermoset. Up to Tg∞, a linear relationship between the maximumtemperature during cure and Tgwas found. Carbon and glass fiber composites were EB-cured and tested. Adding fibers to the <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> lowered the exotherm, whichclearly confirmed the importance of temperature during cure tofully crosslink the polymer matrix. Comparing EB-, UV- and thermal cure showed that the curingmethod was not the factor that most influenced the propertiesof the cured thermoset.

40|$|Global {{increase}} in patients seeking orthodontic treatment creates {{a demand for}} the use of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> in removable appliances and retainers. Orthodontic removable appliance wearers have a higher risk of oral infections that are caused by the formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms on the appliance surface. Here, we present the synthetic route for an antibacterial and antifungal organically-modified silicate (ORMOSIL) that has multiple methacryloloxy functionalities attached to a siloxane backbone (quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate, or QAMS). By dissolving the water-insoluble, rubbery ORMOSIL in methyl methacrylate, QAMS may be copolymerized with polymethyl methacrylate, and covalently incorporated in the pressure-processed <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b> The latter demonstrated a predominantly contact-killing effect on Streptococcus mutans ATCC 36558 and Actinomyces naselundii ATCC 12104 biofilms, while inhibiting adhesion of Candida albicans ATCC 90028 on the acrylic surface. Apart from its favorable antimicrobial activities, QAMS-containing <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> exhibited decreased water wettability and improved toughness, without adversely affecting the flexural strength and modulus, water sorption and solubility, when compared with QAMS-free <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b> The covalently bound, antimicrobial orthodontic <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> with improved toughness represents advancement over other experimental antimicrobial <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> formulations, in its potential to simultaneously prevent oral infections during appliance wear, and improve the fractur...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{topography}} of denture base material {{is an important}} factor for the"nadhesion of Candida albicans and other microorganisms. "nPurpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the adherence of Candida albicans to four types of denture"nbase materials (Acropars <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin,</b> Meliodent <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin,</b> rough and smooth surfaces of Molloplast B). "nMaterials and Methods: Seven blocks of two types of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> and ten blocks of silicone with one"nrough and one smooth surface were made and incubated in a suspension of Candida albicans. After washing,"nthe blocks were stained with acridine orange and examined under fluorescent microscope. For statistical"nanalysis ANOVA and Duncan tests were used. "nResults: It was observed that Candida adhesion to rough surfaces of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> and silicone was"nsignificantly more than polished surfaces of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> and smooth silicone (PO. 0001). However, no"nstatistical significant difference was found between polished <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> surfaces and smooth silicone. "nConclusion: Significant differences in the adherence of Candida to the surfaces of different denture base"nmaterials are due to differences in surface topography, chemical, physical and hydrophobic properties so it is"nrecommended to minimize the roughness and irregularities of denture base...|$|R
40|$|A laboratoric {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the transverse strength of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> after Coleus amboinicus, Lour extract solution immersion. The aim {{of this study is to}} know the difference of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> transverse strengths caused by immersion time variations in a concentrate solution. The study was carried out on unpolished <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> plates with 65 × 10 × 2, 5 mm dimension; solution with 15 % Coleus amboinicus, Lour extract, and 30, 60, 90 days immersion times to measure the transverse strength and sterilized aquadest was used as control. <b>Acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> plates transverse strength was measured using Autograph AG- 10 TE. The data was analyzed using One-Way Anova and LSD with 5 % degree of significance. The result showed that longer immersion time will decrease the transverse strength of the <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> plates. After 90 days immersion time, the transverse strength decrease is still above the recommended standard transverse strength. </span...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fractures of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> {{dentures}} are {{a common}} occurrence in clinical dentistry. The denture may be fractured accidentally when dropped or while in service in the mouth due to flexural fatigue. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the elastic modulus and the flexural strength between two heat-cured <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins</b> used in denture bases: a high-impact resin (Lucitone 199) and a traditional resin (Rodex). Materials and methods: Rectangular strips of Lucitone 199 and Rodex (10 samples each) were fabricated and stored in artificial saliva at 37  °C for 2  weeks. The specimens were subjected to a three-point flexural test. The data were statistically analysed with Student’s t-test (p ⩽ . 05).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of {{mechanical}} polishing (MP) and chemical polishing (CP) on the average surface roughness (Ra) of heat-cured (HC) and light-cured (LC) denture base <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins.</b> Methods: A total of 120 specimens (30  ×  15  ×  3  mm) were prepared from one HC and one LC <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b> To remove nodules and gross surface irregularities, all specimens were finished with a lathe-mounted small acrylic bur and 360 -grit sandpaper. Ten finished specimens of each <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> were randomly assigned to each of six polishing techniques: Resilit High-luster Polishing Liquid (RHPL), Universal Polishing Paste, Abraso-star K 50, pumice, Jet Seal Liquid, or Acrypoint. MP was performed with an automatic polishing machine for 2  min, under 50  rpm and 500  g of load. CP was performed by immersing the HC and LC specimens in preheated methyl methacrylate at 75  ±  1  °C for 10  s. The surface roughness of the <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> specimens was measured with a contact profilometer. The Ra values were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, post hoc Scheffe's test, and paired t-test (p ⩽  0. 05). Polished and tested <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> surfaces were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Results: MP was more effective than CP. The smoothest surface was obtained with the use of the RHPL on the LC (0. 05  ±  0. 01  μm) or HC (0. 07  ±  0. 01  μm) <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b> Two-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between MP and CP.

40|$|Poor {{mechanical}} properties {{are among the}} main limitations of <b>acrylic</b> <b>resins.</b> Addition of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles to <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> {{has been shown to}} improve its {{mechanical properties}} with an adverse effect on its color. Thus, this study sought to assess the tensile and impact strength of a color modified heat cure <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> reinforced with TiO 2 nanoparticles. In this in vitroexperimental study, 1 wt% TiO 2 nanoparticles were added to SR Triplex Hot heat-cure <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> powder and mixed. Pigments and color fibers were also added and 18 samples were fabricated of this paste for tensile and impact strength testing (n= 9) according to ISO 5271. Eighteen control samples were also fabricated from the acrylic powder without any modification. Independent t-test was used for data analysis (P< 0. 05). The mean tensile strength of the reinforced group was found to be significantly higher (difference of 11 MPa) than that of the control group (P= 0. 001). The mean impact strength of the reinforced group was 7 MPa higher than that of the control group and this difference was statistically significant as well (P= 0. 001). The color modified <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> reinforced with 1 wt% TiO 2 showed significantly higher tensile and impact strength compared to the conventional <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin.</b> Thus, TiO 2 nanoparticles may be incorporated into color-modified <b>acrylic</b> <b>resin</b> powder to enhance its tensile and impact strength, given that they have no adverse effect on other properties...|$|R
