500|$|<b>Table</b> <b>5</b> {{shows the}} intransitive {{indicative}} inflection for patient person {{and number of}} the verb neri- [...] "to eat" [...] in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation—questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most Indo-European languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears {{to show up in}} the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).|$|E
500|$|Continuous {{decompression}} is decompression without stops. Instead of {{a fairly}} rapid ascent rate {{to the first}} stop, followed by a period at static depth during the stop, the ascent is slower, but without officially stopping. In theory this is the optimum decompression profile. In practice this {{is very difficult to}} do manually, and {{it may be necessary to}} stop the ascent occasionally to get back on schedule, but these stops are not part of the schedule, they are corrections. For example, USN treatment <b>table</b> <b>5,</b> referring to treatment in a decompression chamber for type 1 decompression sickness, states [...] "Descent rate - 20ft/min. [...] Ascent rate - Not to exceed 1ft/min. Do not compensate for slower ascent rates. Compensate for faster rates by halting the ascent." ...|$|E

500|$|A multiplace chamber is the {{preferred}} facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel, but monoplace chambers are more widely available and {{should be used for}} treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment, as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery. It may be necessary to modify the optimum treatment schedule [...] to allow use of a monoplace chamber, but this is usually better than delaying treatment. A US Navy treatment <b>table</b> <b>5</b> can be safely performed without air breaks if a built-in breathing system is not available. In most cases the patient can be adequately treated in a monoplace chamber at the receiving hospital.|$|E

The RR ratios presented in <b>Table</b> <b>5</b> revealed that the following symptoms were highly indicative of placement in the BPD rather than the CPTSD class: (1) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, (2) unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, (3) markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self, and (4) impulsiveness. Given the gravity of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors, {{it is important to}} note that there were also marked differences in the presence of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors with approximately 50% of individuals in the BPD class reporting this symptom but much fewer and an equivalent number doing so in the CPSD and PTSD classes (14.3 and 16.7%, respectively). The only BPD symptom that individuals in the BPD class did not differ from the CPTSD class was chronic feelings of emptiness, suggesting that in this sample, this symptom is not specific to either BPD or CPTSD and does not discriminate between them." ...|$|E
