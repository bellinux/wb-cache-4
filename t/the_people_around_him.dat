5|$|Balzac {{concerned}} himself overwhelmingly {{with the}} darker essence {{of human nature}} and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies. His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.|$|E
5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E
5000|$|On the children's show Sesame Street, Oscar the Grouch, {{completely}} fed up {{with all}} <b>the</b> nice <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> on Sesame Street, sings a song called [...] "On This Street Where I'm Grouchy", which spoofs [...] "On the Street Where You Live".|$|R
50|$|Armstrong {{typically}} {{works from}} {{pen and ink}} drawings and pencil sketches, carefully observing <b>the</b> landscape and <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He also creates watercolors on location, en plein air.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>people</b> crowded <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{demanding}} <b>the</b> tale of his adventures, {{and their}} surprise was only equaled by their horror {{when they learned}} he had been captured by a band of monkeys, and shut up in a cage because he {{was thought to be}} a dangerous wild beast.|$|R
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of}} the road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the time he came home in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> occupies his book.|$|E
3000|$|... ‘[The child] {{does not}} inherit articulatory {{procedures}} or grammatical paradigms; he re-creates every form {{according to the}} model of <b>the</b> forms that <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> use,…’ (Meillet 1937 : 19) [...]...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the general}} respect of Iakovos by <b>the</b> {{majority}} of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{there were several}} unsuccessful attempts to have him removed from the Patriarchate: Iakovos was actually replaced twice as Protopsaltes.|$|R
50|$|A burglar {{joins the}} circus {{to escape the}} police. Yet, he {{continues}} his thefts during his off-hours and gets involved in <b>the</b> problems of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> while also romancing {{one of the other}} circus performers.|$|R
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{most of the}} films {{directed}} by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.|$|E
25|$|Sun was a {{complicated}} man - it cannot only be big music, {{it must also}} be sensitive music....I don’t worry about what is 'Chinese' or 'Western'. I was raised with both musical traditions, with operas from both cultures. I can write what comes naturally; what I feel gives a sense of Sun as a person, and the feelings of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
50|$|He worked {{predominantly}} in a regionalist style. In his art, Wyeth's favorite {{subjects were}} <b>the</b> land and <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> both {{in his hometown}} of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and at his summer home in Cushing, Maine.|$|R
50|$|After Stefan (Paul Wesley) {{lost his}} memory, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) {{tries to help}} him {{remember}}. He remembers the date and where he is, but he cannot remember who he is, who <b>the</b> <b>people</b> are <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> or even {{that he is a}} vampire. Damon presents Stefan with his diaries to jog his memory with, but he still has no recollection of his past.|$|R
5000|$|At age 10, Corey {{started the}} [...] "If I Can Do It, You Can To" [...] foundation, {{with which he}} toured to give motivational speeches to {{children}} in auditoriums, while also making appearances on CNN and the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Since 2013 he helped feed families for Thanksgiving and given out large donations of toys to disenfranchised children. Corey mentions his father Chase as his biggest influence as well as <b>the</b> positive <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dick Su as Seng: Dick Su was {{involved}} in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|One day, three {{children}} {{who claimed that}} Seigi is their father suddenly appears. Two of them are siblings whose mother had recently died, while the other is left at home alone because her mother frequently runs away with her boyfriends. Seigi eventually takes them in to care for them. Over time, Seigi and the children start to bond after overcoming the many challenges that come their way. Thanks {{to the influence of}} his children, Seigi starts to grow out of his selfish and immature ways, and starts to consider the feelings of his children and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|The equestrian director, August, is {{a brutal}} man who mistreats {{the animals in}} his care (such as the new elephant, Rosie) and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> but he can also be charming and generous. Jacob {{develops}} a guarded relationship with August and his wife, Marlena, with whom Jacob falls in love. August is suspicious of their relationship and beats Marlena and Jacob. Marlena subsequently leaves August and stays at a hotel while she is not performing. Uncle Al then informs Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic and utters a threat: reunite August and Marlena as a happily married couple or Walter and Camel get red-lighted.|$|E
5000|$|Headphone Harold - Harold prefers {{listening}} to the music on his headphones rather than <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and noises <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Unfortunately, his habit causes him a problem when he takes {{a walk on the}} train tracks.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, a {{resident}} of Gopali village, Mr. Mrinal Kanti Bhanja saw <b>the</b> sufferings of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and it severely jolted him. And that is {{when he decided to}} work with all the resources and force that he could muster towards uplifting the society.|$|R
5000|$|A hapless, {{paranoid}} man (Freeman) over-analyses {{the situations}} he stumbles into {{in his head}} and worries that people will think he looks like a pervert, stalker or paedophile, causing him to shout out loud that he isn't, to <b>the</b> bewilderment of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|Troughton {{played the}} role {{generally}} in a more lightweight, comical manner, albeit still {{with much of the}} original character's passionate hatred of evil and desire to help the oppressed. He also on occasion showed a darker side, manipulating his companions and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> for the greater good (examples include The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Evil of the Daleks). Davis left the show {{at the end of the}} fourth season, and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer. Bryant's successor as script editor was Derrick Sherwin (though Victor Pemberton had filled the job for Bryant's first serial, The Tomb of the Cybermen).|$|E
25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E
25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E
60|$|Without {{waiting for}} a reply, he rose and left the room. The young doctor hesitated no longer. Regret at quitting <b>the</b> poor <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> was overborne by {{the fear of being}} left behind, for he had by that time begun to {{entertain}} a vague suspicion that the stern and peculiar man by whom he was led would not permit any object whatever to {{stand in the way of}} what he believed to be his duty.|$|R
5000|$|In the meantime, Joey, in Reggie's body, embarks {{on a tour}} of vengeance: He has {{sworn to}} (literally) [...] "poke" [...] all <b>the</b> {{unpleasant}} <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> [...] "in <b>the</b> snoot", starting with his press agent and the director of a recent film of his. He also enters the Brinkmeyer estate and pushes Miss Brinkmeyer into the swimming pool. Wherever he goes, eyewitnesses describe him as looking like a gorilla. (Fair-haired Reggie Havershot admits earlier on in the novel that he is not particularly handsome.) ...|$|R
5000|$|There was a Hudson's Bay Company {{post at the}} lake, as well as {{a number}} of {{agricultural}} enterprises fostered by the mission. However, Rundle did not view his role as that of a [...] "company man" [...] or government representative. Instead, he sought to help <b>the</b> Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> survive in <b>the</b> face of incoming European settlement. When the Hudson's Bay Company pressured him to establish mission schools, he spent some time looking for an appropriate site - but intentionally did not establish the mission school.|$|R
25|$|Light's {{personality}} dramatically changes {{after he}} has a Death Note compared to when he does not. This can be seen when Light puts himself in L's captivity because he 'might be Kira'. Light tells Ryuk to relinquish his ownership of the Death Note after saying 'get rid of it'. Afterwards, Light loses all memory of the Death Note and he reverts to his normal personality. Without the Death Note, he has cares for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and is reluctant to manipulate them. He even refuses to 'use' Misa Amane to get information out of her when L asks him to; however, later in the story, when Light regains his memories, {{he seems to have}} no problem 'using' Kiyomi Takada and manipulating her feelings in order to get what he wants. Despite serving Light faithfully, he repays her devotion with a painful death the moment she is no longer of use to him, expressing no emotion other than elation at the fact that her death has moved him closer to his goal.|$|E
500|$|Bower {{expected}} Chris's {{coming out}} storyline to receive criticism and some media commentators called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab". Mason and the show's script producer defended the storyline, {{saying that it}} was not a ploy to boost ratings and that it explored how Chris's coming out affected <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Television critics and LGBT websites have given the character and his storyline development a positive reception. In 2012, Mason earned a nomination for Most Popular New Male Talent at the Logie Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "La Mordidita" [...] was filmed in Cartagena, Colombia in mid-March 2015 with Simón Brand serving as its director. The first {{scenes of the}} clip were filmed at the Casa Museo Rafael Núñez, where Martin was {{accompanied}} by Colombian actress and ballet dancer María Cecilia Sánchez. Other scenes were filmed on various local streets in the city. Speaking about the concept behind the video, Brand elaborated that it revolved around Martin spreading a [...] "virus" [...] through a bite, converting <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> into [...] "sensual and amusing" [...] dancing zombies. He concluded that [...] "basically, we will be spreading the nibble across the city".|$|E
5000|$|The present reality, {{in which}} Dark is tormented by {{incredible}} pain. Dark interacts with <b>the</b> various <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> as <b>the</b> {{doctors and nurses}} attempt to help, but are dismissed by Dark's anger and bitterness towards everyone. His sense of reality then collapses into hallucinations as <b>the</b> <b>people</b> randomly sing choreographed musical numbers, such as [...] "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?" [...] In the end, his reality is blended with the film noir and he is abducted by the two mysterious men, only to be shot by the titular [...] "singing detective".|$|R
2500|$|Against the {{background}} of the growing popularity of Vaikundar [...] and <b>the</b> convergence of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in multitudes, a complaint was lodged against him with the king of Travancore. The king arrested Vaikundar and tortured him. [...] Ayya may have been arrested on 11 November 1839, but the date is not mentioned in Akilam.|$|R
60|$|The {{country was}} greatly incensed at this decision. There was no proof {{whatever}} that Henry had done any thing wrong. Henry, however, {{submitted to the}} king's decree, apparently without murmuring, and took his departure. As he journeyed toward Dover, where he was to embark, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> flocked <b>around</b> <b>him</b> at all the towns and villages that he passed through, and mourned his departure; and when finally he embarked at Dover and went away, {{they said that the}} only shield, defense, and comfort of the commonwealth was gone.|$|R
