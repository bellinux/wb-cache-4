5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing <b>that</b> <b>African</b> American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said <b>that</b> <b>African</b> American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the German forces in German East Africa, on Nyasaland's far northern border, hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently. On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying <b>that</b> <b>African</b> uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E

The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific racism {{played a}} role in {{establishing}} apartheid in South Africa. In South Africa, white scientists, like Dudly Kidd, who published The essential Kafir in 1904, sought to [...] "understand the African mind".

Rather than suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> were [...] "overgrown children", as early white explorers had, Kidd believed <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> were [...] "misgrown with a vengeance". He described Africans as at once [...] "hopelessly deficient", yet [...] "very shrewd".|$|R

5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E
5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, in the same way <b>that</b> <b>African</b> elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E
5|$|United States President Woodrow Wilson {{pronounced}} white participants the instigators of {{the prolonged}} riots in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. As a result, {{he attempted to}} promote greater racial harmony through the promotion of voluntary organizations and through the enactment of legislative improvements by the United States Congress. He did not change the segregation of federal departments which he had imposed early during his first administration, however.

5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, {{according}} to Brent, [...] "the explorers themselves {{had no such}} view of Africans, no simple picture <b>that</b> rejected <b>African</b> reality and denied to Africans their full humanity." [...] Mungo Park’s description in particular contributed to a balanced perspective. George Shepperson writes that, beyond Park's romanticized travel exploits, [...] "his writing indicated <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> were human beings with their own cultures and commerce (and not monstrous creatures), with whom constructive relations would be possible." ...|$|R
25|$|Other {{scholars}} accused Walter Rodney of mischaracterizing {{the trade}} between Africans and Europeans.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} argued <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> {{do not have}} a philosophy. How can it be <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> {{do not have a}} philosophy when they are among the three known world cultures namely oriental, western and African cultures? If we say Africans do not have a philosophy we are saying directly or indirectly that they are not human beings and therefore cannot reason and reflect like other human beings. In other words, it means <b>that</b> <b>Africans</b> are sub-humans. This cannot be a fair assertion to Africans since Africans possess all the qualities that all other human beings possess. Hence, in this work, attention is focused on examining whether or not Africans do have a philosophy by establishing {{at least one of the}} avenues through which any philosophy can be expressed i. e. through a language. The oriental philosophy can be expressed in oriental language while western philosophy can be expressed in western language. Can African philosophy be expressed in African language like the other two world cultures? If it can, then, the existence of African philosophy is not impossible. Thus, this paper stands to examine language as a source through which authentic African philosophy as one of the authentic world recognized and famous philosophies can be possible...|$|R
5|$|To {{defeat the}} Voting Rights Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure <b>that</b> <b>African</b> Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E
