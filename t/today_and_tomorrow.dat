5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, <b>Today</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

50|$|Generational {{accounting}} considers {{how much}} each adult generation, {{on a per}} person basis, is likely to pay in future taxes net of transfer payments, {{over the rest of}} their lives. Aggregating these remaining lifetime net tax payments of adults and subtracting them from the fiscal gap reveals how much <b>today's</b> <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow's</b> children must pay to resolve the country's fiscal gap in current adults don't pay more, on net. This residual burden facing <b>today's</b> <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow's</b> children is allocated to them in proportion to their projected levels of lifetime labor income. I.e., if each successive generation of children is expected to experience, on average, a 1 percent high level of lifetime earners, generational accounting allocates to successive generations net lifetime tax payments that are 1 percent higher.|$|R

2500|$|The mid-20th-century Italian-Israeli scholar Umberto Cassuto, {{formerly}} of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, suggested that the Tower of Babel story in [...] reflects an earlier Israelite poem that regarded with a smile the boastful pride of the Babylonians in their city, temple, and ziggurat. [...] Cassuto deduced that Israelites composed the poem when the city and tower were already in ruins, and he posited that they were written in the centuries {{after the fall of}} the First Babylonian Dynasty and the destruction of Babylon by the Hittites in the middle of the 16th century B.C.E., during which Israelites remembered the bragging of the Babylonians with derision. Cassuto saw manifest irony in the report of [...] "And they had brick for stone," [...] as if the Israelites mocked the object of Babylonian boasting — buildings of bricks, which stand <b>today</b> <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow</b> are in ruins — as if the poor Babylonians did not even have hard stone for building such as the Israelites had in the land of Israel. Similarly, the liberal German Rabbi and scholar Benno Jacob, writing in 1934, saw irony in the report of [...] "And the Lord came down," [...] which implied that the tower supposed to reach to the heavens was still far from there, and that seen from above, the gigantic structure was only the work of [...] "children," [...] of miniature men.|$|E
