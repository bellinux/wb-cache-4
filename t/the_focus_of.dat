5|$|After Parker {{was hired}} to direct the film, Gerolmo had {{completed}} two drafts.

40|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} {{energy is}} well established for the case of collective collapse of cloud cavitation. It has been indicated however that erosion can also be generated by cavities that stay glassy until a very late stage of the collapse, a circumstance implying that <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> energy should be analyzed also {{for this type of}} cavities. In this study, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse energy has been applied in practical observations as a procedure for analysis of erosive cavities. From some experiments, it was found that glassy cavities can, as focusing cavities, be closely related to the generation of severe erosion. A simplified cascading process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> collapse energy is also assumed for the glassy cavity. Furthermore, erosion tests results showed that any type <b>of</b> fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse energy lead to a decrease of the collapse pressure and thus a decrease of the erosion...|$|R

50|$|More generally, in the {{gravitational}} two-body problem, {{if the two}} bodies are bound to each other (that is, the total energy is negative), their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> each ellipse. <b>The</b> other <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> either ellipse has no known physical significance.
