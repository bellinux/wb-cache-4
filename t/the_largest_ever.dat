5|$|After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers {{agreed on}} a seven-year, $215 million, {{contract}} extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average annual value of $30.7 million was also <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> for a baseball player, beating the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Championships in August, Bolt eased {{through the}} 100 m heats, {{clocking}} the fastest ever pre-final performance of 9.89 seconds. The final {{was the first}} time Bolt and Gay had met in the season, and Bolt improved his world record with a time of 9.58 s to win his first World Championship gold medal. Taking over a tenth of a second off the previous best mark, this was <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> margin of improvement in the 100 m world record since the beginning of electronic timing. Gay finished with a time of 9.71 s, 0.02 s off Bolt's 9.69 s world-record run in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of the}} crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E

Both the initial print run and first-day sales were <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> for the Random House Children's Book division. Brisingr sold 45,000copies {{on its first}} day in the United Kingdom and was the fastest-selling children's book {{in the country in}} 2008.

5|$|Greinke {{agreed to}} a six-year free agent {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> for a right-handed pitcher {{at the time it}} was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council as it could affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> proposed in London and would affect far more than local traffic due to its Inner Ring Road status.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club {{owned the}} Manchester Giants, Manchester's {{basketball}} franchise, there were {{plans to build}} a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, Martin Edwards, did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold. In August 2009, the car park became home to the Hublot clock tower, a -tall tower {{in the shape of the}} Hublot logo, which houses four -diameter clock faces, <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> made by the company.|$|E
5|$|Meetings between Manchester United and Arsenal {{were often}} eventful encounters, as both clubs vied for {{domestic}} honours. A goalless draw {{between the two}} clubs in September 2003, in which Ruud van Nistelrooy missed a penalty in stoppage time, resulted in an altercation between both teams. Several Arsenal players were charged and fined accordingly by The Football Association (FA) for instigating the brawl; the club was later fined £175,000, <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> given to a club by the FA.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 14 August 1978. The main {{shooting}} was switched {{from the usual}} 007 Stage at the Pinewood Studios to France, due to high taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E

Her debut album, Faryl, was recorded from December 2008 to January 2009 and released in March 2009. Faryl became the fastest-selling solo classical album in British chart history, selling 29,200 copies in the first week. It debuted at number six and rose to number four the following week, making Smith the third Britain's Got Talent contestant to have a top ten album. In 2010, on account of Faryl, Smith was nominated for two Classical BRIT Awards and became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination.|$|E
5|$|South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya {{hosted the}} 2003 World Cup. The number of teams {{participating}} in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others– and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns– enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate. In the final, Australia made 359 runs {{for the loss of}} two wickets, <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{different}} players {{were used by}} Nelson during their 44 competitive matches, {{less than half of}} whom had played for the club in previous campaigns. Goalkeeper Harry Abbott and half-back Ernie Braidwood were the two ever-presents for Nelson during 1924–25. Centre forward Joe Eddleston scored 26 goals in 43 games to become the team's top goalscorer for the fourth consecutive season. Two Nelson records were set during the campaign, although one was later broken; the seven-goal winning margin against Crewe Alexandra was never bettered in Football League matches, while the attendance of 13,500 for the visit of Darlington in April 1925 was <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> seen at Seedhill at that time.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch is {{represented}} by a single parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons. The seat was created in 1983 from parts of the Christchurch and Lymington, North Dorset and New Forest constituencies. It had been held by Robert Adley (Conservative) since its creation {{until his death in}} 1993. At the by-election Diana Maddock (Liberal Democrat) was elected in one of <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> swings (35.4%) against the sitting party. The seat was retaken by Conservative candidate Christopher Chope in 1997 and retained in 2001 and 2005. In the 2010 general election, Chope retained his seat with a considerable majority of 15,410 and 56.4% of the vote, making Christchurch one of the safest Conservative constituencies in the country. The Liberal Democrats won 25.3% of the vote, Labour 9.8% and the Independence Party 8.5%. Christchurch is part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{matters in}} Khurasan, Harun {{returned}} to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt. According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters. These numbers—and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300,000 men—are easily <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>ever</b> recorded for the entire Abbasid era and {{far more than the}} estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army. Although they are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative {{of the size of the}} Abbasid force. At the same time, a naval force under his admiral Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri was prepared to raid Cyprus.|$|E
