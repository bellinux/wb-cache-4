5000|$|The European Union {{ability for}} {{legislative}} acts and other initiatives on language policy is based legally in the {{provisions in the}} Treaties of the European Union. In the EU, language policy {{is the responsibility of}} member states and the European Union does not have a common [...] "language policy." [...] Based on the principle of [...] "subsidiarity," [...] European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in the member states language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states (Article 149.2). The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously (Article 290). All languages, in which was originally drawn up or <b>was</b> translated due <b>to</b> enlargement, <b>are</b> legally <b>equally</b> <b>authentic.</b> Every citizen of the Union may write to any of the EU institutions or bodies in one of these languages and have an answer in the same language (Article 314).|$|R

50|$|Moses {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} prophets in the Bahá'í Faith. He <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a messenger from God who <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> as those sent in other eras. An epithet of Moses in Baha'i scriptures is Interlocutor of God, or alternatively the One Who Conversed with God.|$|R
50|$|A broad form of sunnah {{was already}} being practised by the Christians, Jews and the Arab {{descendants}} of Ishmael, the Arabized Arabs or Ishmaelites, when Muhammad reinstituted this practice {{as an integral}} part of Islam. Both sunnah and Quran <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> and the former includes worship rituals like salat, Zakat, Hajj, fasting (sawm) during Ramadan as well as customs like circumcision.|$|R
5000|$|The CISG {{is written}} using [...] "plain {{language}} {{that refers to}} things and events for which there are words of common content". [...] This was a conscious intent to allow national legal systems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcended {{through the use of}} a common legal lingua franca and avoids the [...] "words associated with specific domestic legal nuances". [...] Further, it facilitated the translation into the UN's six official languages. As is customary in UN conventions all 6 languages <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{end of a}} treaty, the eschatocol (or closing protocol), {{is often}} {{signaled}} by a clause like [...] "in witness whereof" [...] or [...] "in faith whereof," [...] the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words [...] "DONE at," [...] then the site(s) of the treaty's execution and the date(s) of its execution. The date is typically written in its most formal, longest possible form. For example, the Charter of the United Nations was [...] "DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five." [...] If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted, and {{is followed by a}} stipulation that the versions in different languages <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|R
40|$|In today's globalized world, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the use of two or more languages in law and judicial process {{as in the case of}} Hong Kong and the European Union and the Court of Justice of the European Union. In such bilingual/multilingual jurisdictions, one basic legal principle of interpretation is that the law in different official languages <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> and <b>is</b> deemed the same, the 'equal authenticity rule'. Such a principle governs and guides both the legislative drafting process and the judicial interpretation of laws. This chapter describes the legislative drafting process of bilingual and multilingual laws and discusses judicial interpretation of such laws. It outlines the basic legal rule of equal authenticity followed by an examination of the situations in Hong Kong and the EU. It also discusses how the courts approach linguistic disagreements found or allegedly found in bilingual and multilingual laws. Some of the interpretive rules adopted by the courts in the search for meaning and certainty are also highlighted. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Languages and LinguisticsNo Full Tex...|$|R
2500|$|Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{commented on}} the most {{significant}} area of disagreement regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from [...] "the" [...] territories or from [...] "all" [...] territories. In the French version, which <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic,</b> it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning [...] "the." [...] We wanted that <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be [...] "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take {{a fresh look at}} the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel {{as a result of the}} June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.|$|R
60|$|At {{our table}} at the inn there was a Prussian officer who treated me with great civility, and asked me a {{thousand}} questions about England; which I answered as best I might. But this best, I <b>am</b> bound <b>to</b> say, <b>was</b> bad enough. I knew nothing about England, and the Court, and the noble families there; but, led away by the vaingloriousness of youth (and a propensity which I possessed in my early days, but of which I have long since corrected myself, to boast and talk in a manner not altogether consonant with truth), I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the King and the Ministers to him, said the British Ambassador at Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. When the officer asked me my uncle's name, I <b>was</b> not able <b>to</b> give him the real name, and so said his name was O'Grady: it {{is as good a}} name as any other, and those of Kilballyowen, county Cork, are as good a family as any in the world, as I have heard. As for stories about my regiment, of these, of course, I had no lack. I wish my other histories had <b>been</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed and shawl) are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave, but can also be silk barathea. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and shawl collar <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> and correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fastened with a link front closure which <b>is</b> visually similar <b>to</b> a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|R
