5|$|During Vladislav's reign, {{his uncle}} Archbishop Sava {{went on a}} pilgrimage and died in Bulgaria while on his way home. Vladislav {{obtained}} the remains and buried them in the Mileševa monastery, which he had built intended to be his burial place. Serbia was politically aligned with Bulgaria at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>since</b> Vladislav was married to Beloslava, the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Vladislav secured Hum, a maritime province under attack by Hungarian crusaders.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> {{the initial}} {{commercial}} service to Roanoke commenced in 1933, various airlines have offered non-stop service {{to and from}} Roanoke. Prior to airline deregulation, carriers such as Eastern Airlines provided service. However, the original Piedmont Airlines has left the most lasting legacy on commercial aviation in Roanoke.|$|E

5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear of a Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear of a Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007 {{there are}} five church {{buildings}} in the Sycamore Historic District. When it was nominated to join the National Register there were seven church buildings within the district. One of those included is a residential structure that was utilized as a church {{when it was first}} constructed; the Arthur Stark House was once home to the Sycamore Universalist Church congregation. In <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> its listing, two churches have been destroyed or demolished. The Evangelical Church of St. John was destroyed by fire in 2004 and the United Methodist Church in Sycamore is no longer extant, replaced by a modern office building. The extant churches are the Old Congregational Church, First Baptist Church, St. Peter's Church, the Universalist Church/Stark House and St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
50|$|With the win, the Wildcats {{improved}} to 5-1 while the Warhawks fell to 3-3.

5|$|BSR Housewares {{became the}} club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been {{sponsored}} {{for the majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> then, although there was no shirt sponsor {{at the end of the}} 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004–08), Homeserve (2010–11), Bodog (2011–12), Zoopla (2012–14), Intuit Quickbooks (2014–15), TLCBET (2015–16) and K8 group (2016–2017).|$|E
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>since</b> the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

5|$|The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are {{a line of}} {{sandwiches}} {{developed by}} the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 {{as part of a}} new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system has been changed several times since then, {{and the number of}} counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format has largely been in place since 1968 as only small changes have been made since then, the last of which was in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} eight years {{following}} the conclusion of Banjo-Tooie, in which Gruntilda's body was destroyed by Banjo and Kazooie. In <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since,</b> the two have become lazy and out of shape from their lack of adventuring. Gruntilda's detached head returns to their home of Spiral Mountain for revenge, but the three are interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Lord of Games (L.O.G.), the creator of all video games. He decides to settle {{the conflict between the}} two by devising a series of worlds and challenges. He uses his powers to give Gruntilda an artificial body and to restore the duo's physical fitness, but not their moves from previous games, claiming that they will not need them.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Below {{is a list}} of all the {{managers}} Linfield have appointed during the club's history. In the early years after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed in the 40 years since Billy Campbell's departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, each having led the club to 31 trophies – a combined 62 major honours between them. Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney is the club's last manager, having been appointed in May 2014. He resigned in October 2015 to become assistant manager of Newport County.|$|E
