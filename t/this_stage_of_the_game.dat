500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A, being described as [...] "an expertly paced race against time". The handling of Anderson's pregnancy was called [...] "creative", while the re-opening of the X-Files unit and the revelation of Krycek as a villainous character were noted as highlights. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called [...] "Ascension" [...] an [...] "essential" [...] episode, adding that it serves to [...] "raise the stakes without losing {{the core of the}} show's appeal, and solve a technical problem in the most creatively satisfying way possible". Handlen also praised Nicholas Lea's portrayal of agent Alex Krycek, but felt that the character's role as a double agent was revealed too soon in the series. Critical Myth gave this episode 9/10, stating [...] "s convoluted and bastardized as that plot thread would become, at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{it was one of the}} best episodes of the series to date." ...|$|E

Five months later, Voinovich requested to Bush in a five-page letter that the U.S. begin pulling troops from Iraq and asking that the Iraqis start {{taking care of their}} own territory, calling for a [...] "comprehensive plan for our country's gradual military disengagement from Iraq".|$|E
2500|$|Duos: With 8 contestants remaining, {{teams were}} broken into 4 pairs {{of male and}} female contestants. Damien won the power to choose teams {{as a result of a}} minor challenge. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Jules left the game making an uneven number of contestants, leaving Damien with the {{decision}} to leave one contestant to compete by themselves. The pairs grouped together were: Damien and Laura, Greg and Mel, Courtney and Munnalita, and Pati was left by herself which introduced a new twist. The biggest weight loser of all eliminated contestants returned to the game, this being Marty who was only just eliminated the day before. Greg and Mel were eliminated as part of a double elimination, and were replaced by new contestants Chris and Kimberlie, introduced as [...] "The Outsiders".|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, sonny," [...] he said, with gentle grimness, [...] "you and me {{will have}} an Art to Art talk. You've got your art and I've got mine. Yours is the real Pierian stuff that turns up its nose at bock-beer signs and oleographs of the Old Mill. Mine's the art of Business. This was my scheme, and it worked out like two-and-two. Paint that {{president}} man as Old King Cole, or Venus, or a landscape, or a fresco, or a bunch of lilies, or anything he thinks he looks like. But get the paint on the canvas and collect the spoils. You wouldn't throw me down, Carry, at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Think of that ten thousand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly expected, my fair cousin, {{that you}} would be frightened into retreat at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> when the cards are all in our hands. Do you suppose I decided to carry away Louise without fully {{considering}} what I was doing, and the immediate consequences of my act? And wherein have I failed? All has gone beautifully up to this minute. Diana, your fears are absolutely foolish, and against your personal interests. All that I am doing for myself benefits you doubly. Just consider, if you will, what has been accomplished for our mutual benefit: The girl has disappeared under suspicious circumstances; before she again rejoins her family and friends she will either be my wife or Arthur Weldon will prefer not to marry her. That leaves him open to appreciate the charms of Diana Von Taer, does it not? Already, my dear cousin, your wishes are accomplished. My own task, I admit, is a harder one, because it is more delicate." ...|$|E

That's where I come in. If he would bring her the bones of her mother, and of her {{grandfather}} (who {{was the father of}} Kaaukuu, and who by tradition was rumoured to have been even bigger than his giant son, she would return to Ahuna the bait of his hair she was praying him to death with. He, on the other hand, stipulated that he was not to reveal to her the secret burial-place of all the alii of Lakanaii all the way back. Nevertheless, he was too old to dare the adventure alone, must be helped by some one who of necessity would come to know the secret, and I was that one. I was the highest alii, beside my father and mother, and they were no higher than I.|$|E

6000|$|I {{take the}} adventures of several couples of destroyers who, {{on the night of}} May 31, were nosing along somewhere towards the Schleswig-Holstein coast, ready to chop any Hun-stuff coming back to earth by that {{particular}} road. The leader of one line was Gehenna, and the next two ships astern of her were Eblis and Shaitan, in the order given. There were others, of course, but {{with the exception of one}} Goblin they don't come violently into this tale. There had been a good deal of promiscuous firing that evening, and actions were going on all round. Towards midnight our destroyers were overtaken by several three-and four-funnel German ships (cruisers they thought) hurrying home. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> anybody might have been anybody--pursuer or pursued. The Germans took no chances, but switched on their searchlights and opened fire on Gehenna. Her acting sub-lieutenant reports: [...] "A salvo hit us forward. I opened fire with the after-guns. A shell then struck us in a steam-pipe, and I could see nothing but steam. But both starboard torpedo-tubes were fired." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{winner of}} the trick draws from the talon once they have {{declared}} their meld. The loser then also draws a card from the talon, thus maintaining eight cards in their hand at all times at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> If no melds are declared by the {{winner of the}} trick, the cards are drawn immediately.|$|E
5000|$|The music website Louder Than War's John Robb {{also gave}} the album strong praise saying that [...] "It's rare at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{that anyone can}} be arsed to be as non-compromising as this let alone {{remember}} the creative power of following your own instinct.". Robb also praised [...] "the demo stage of the song(s)".|$|E

5000|$|The two {{remaining}} players at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{were given a}} [...] "Power Vest" [...] and a [...] "Power Helmet" [...] to wear (both of which were completely covered with Velcro). Johnny would then ask the contestants some video game trivia questions. Each question was a toss-up, meaning players had to buzz in to answer. Answering a question correctly earned points, which were represented by various Velcro-backed items. If a player buzzed in and answered incorrectly, however, the other player would receive three multiple-choice answers to help them answer the question. If neither player rang in before a set time limit, Johnny would reveal the multiple choice answers {{but there was only}} one chance for the question to be answered.|$|E
50|$|Ties {{were played}} on the 16-18 November. Ties which ended in a draw were replayed between the 28 November and the 5 December.

50|$|The contestants were rearranged {{and seated}} {{from left to}} right in order of how they {{finished}} the first round. They were now given statements posed by the host, each one being either a fact or a rumor. Play started with the contestant in the lead after round one. If the contestant correctly identified the statement as a fact or rumor, that contestant earned 100 points. An incorrect answer passed control to the second-place contestant. That contestant continued answering questions until they missed, at which point the third-place contestant gained control. An incorrect answer by the third-place contestant resulted in the first contestant gaining control again. The game lasted for approximately seven minutes. During <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> DuArt provided her celebrity impersonations appropriate to the subject of the questions. Two bells indicated a two-minute warning, and when the final bells rang, the round and the game ended. The contestant in the lead at this point became the champion, won $500 and advanced to the bonus round. If the game ended in a tie, a tiebreaker similar to that used in round one was used to determine a winner.|$|E
