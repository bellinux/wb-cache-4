5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of the event, two of <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> were regeistered as non-British, both rowing for Cambridge. Their number three, William Barton, was born in Wellington, New Zealand, while the number five, C. N. L.

5|$|Heavy rain {{during most}} of the race made {{conditions}} difficult for <b>the</b> <b>competitors.</b> A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where Nicole Cooke won the race. Cooke earned Great Britain's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.|$|E
25|$|An orienteering map, and a compass, are {{the primary}} aids for <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> to {{complete}} an orienteering course of control points as quickly as possible. A map that is reliable and accurate is essential so that a course can be provided which will test the navigational skills of <b>the</b> <b>competitor.</b> <b>The</b> map {{also needs to be}} relevant to the needs of <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> showing <b>the</b> terrain in neither too much nor too little detail.|$|R

5000|$|Usually {{working in}} teams of two, the most {{important}} job of a pickup rider is to help <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> at <b>the</b> end of his/her ride by riding next to the bucking horse, allowing <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> to safely get off of the bucking animal, usually by grabbing the pickup rider or the pickup rider providing stability while <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> jumps or swings free. If a competitor becomes tangled or {{caught up in the}} equipment, a pickup rider may assist <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> in getting free. If a <b>competitor</b> falls off, <b>the</b> pickup rider may help herd the animal away from the fallen rider.|$|R
5|$|In 1898, even {{cars and}} {{motorcycles}} {{were allowed to}} open the road for <b>the</b> <b>competitors.</b> In 1900, the race was within a hair's breadth of disappearing, with only 19 riders at the start. The following year, the organisation therefore decided to allow help only from pacers on bicycles. And in 1910, help from pacers were stopped for good. An option which lifted Paris–Roubaix out of the background and pushed it, in terms of interest, ahead of the prestigious Bordeaux–Paris.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} match {{from the}} SmackDown brand was a Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship, in which title holder Triple H faced Jeff Hardy, The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). The {{build up to}} the match began on the August 22 episode of SmackDown!, when General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced that SmackDown would have a Championship Scramble match and that <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> would include WWE Champion Triple H and four men to be decided later in the night {{through a series of}} qualifying matches. The first qualifying match was a ten man battle royal, which saw The Big Show disrupt the match and throw all <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> over the top rope. The Brian Kendrick, however, was saved by his bodyguard, Ezekiel Jackson, who caught Kendrick and put him back in the ring after the Big Show had eliminated all other competitors. Thus, Kendrick qualified for the Championship Scramble. The second qualifying match saw MVP defeat Festus by count out, qualifying for the match. The third qualifying match was Shelton Benjamin versus Finlay, which Benjamin won. The final qualifying match was Jeff Hardy versus The Great Khali, which Hardy won.|$|E

5|$|Tute {{games are}} played until an {{established}} number of game points is reached. Each {{time one of}} <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> wins a round, one point {{is added to the}} total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.|$|E
5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though since many of <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> lasted for {{only one or two}} issues, Venture {{can be thought of as}} at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E
5000|$|Maintain price: Another {{reaction}} is {{to hope that}} <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> has made a mistake, but if <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> action does make inroads into a merchant's share, this can soon mean customers lose confidence and a subsequent a loss of sales.|$|R
5000|$|In both trail orienteering and North American style mounted orienteering, {{it may not}} be feasible, safe, or {{permitted}} for <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> to go to {{the control}} point itself. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> views <b>the</b> control point from a short distance and marks the control card with a pen. Several marking schemes are in use, including a pre-printed multiple choice form, and a [...] "secret word" [...] posted at the control point that <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> must copy down.|$|R
5000|$|A shot timer is a shot {{activated}} timer used in shooting sports, {{which starts}} <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> by an audible signal and also records <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> time electronically by detecting {{the sound of}} each shot together with the time from the start signal. When <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> is finished <b>the</b> timer will show the time from the start signal until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second (centisecond), which is required by competitions in the International Practical Shooting Confederation.|$|R
5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between <b>the</b> <b>competitors,</b> the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans. <b>The</b> <b>competitors</b> were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E

40|$|Learning from {{competitors}} poses {{a challenge}} for existing theories of reward-based learning, which assume that rewarded actions {{are more likely to}} be executed in the future. Such a learning mechanism would disadvantage a player in a competitive situation because, since <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> loss is <b>the</b> player's gain, reward might become associated with an action the player should themselves avoid. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural activity of humans competing with a computer in a foraging task. We observed neural activity that represented the variables required for learning from competitors: the actions of <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> (in <b>the</b> player's motor and premotor cortex) and the reward prediction error arising from <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> feedback. In particular, regions positively correlated with the unexpected loss of <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> (which was beneficial to the player) included the striatum and those regions previously implicated in response inhibition. Our results suggest that learning in such contexts may involve <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> unexpected losses activating regions of the player's brain that subserve response inhibition, as the player learns to avoid the actions that produced them...|$|R

5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> play in groups of three {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>competitors</b> {{must decide}} how much to pay each agent, {{and how much to}} pay the local guide in that region. If there are {{competing}} offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of 10 years by Atchison, {{who came up with the}} initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National Spelling Bee and noting that a majority of <b>the</b> <b>competitors</b> came from good socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film Spellbound. Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of account conflicts is {{generally regarded as}} {{a very serious problem}} in the advertising industry. The problem is that once an advertising agency works for a firm it learns private information which it can use strategically, i. e., make available to <b>the</b> firm's <b>competitors.</b> But, in oligopolistic situations, knowing more about a competitor may not necessarily be beneficial, because <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> may react to this knowledge. Similarly, allowing <b>the</b> <b>competitor</b> to have more information may not necessarily be detrimental. In fact, the decision of whether to share the same agency depends on three effects, which are identified here: (1), (2), and (3). The first effect always favors sharing the same gency. The direction of the latter two effects is ambiguous. This ambiguity is resolved against the sharing of agencies when (1) <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> reaction to <b>the</b> firm's situation is especially harmful in that particular situation (strategic effect) and (2) <b>the</b> <b>competitor's</b> actions are increasingly harmful (). competitive strategy, advertising policy, advertising agency...|$|R
