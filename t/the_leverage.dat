5|$|A {{pipeline}} to the Kenyan port of Lamu is being discussed which could provide an alternative route if Sudan chooses {{to close the}} northern pipeline.

5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve <b>the</b> <b>leverage.</b> Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} scheme that {{leverage}} orthonormal or biorthogonal wavelets {{to a new}} system of biorthogonal wavelets. <b>The</b> <b>leveraged</b> biorthogonal wavelets will have some nice properties. If we start with orthonormal wavelets, <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> scaling functions and wavelets are compactly supported and are differentiable. The derivatives of <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> wavelets are orthogonal to their translations; the derivatives of <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> scaling functions are nearly orthogonal to their translations; and the derivatives of <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> scaling functions and wavelets are orthogonal to each other. This feature may be valuable for the numerical solution of differential equations. If we start with B-splines and cooperating with the lifting scheme of Sweldens, our leverage scheme can reproduce all of those biorthogonal wavelets by Cohen, Daubechies and Feauveau. There is a simple algorithm to calculate new filter coefficients from the old filter coefficients. In the end of this article we test the newly [...] ...|$|R

5|$|On January 14, 1964, {{players in}} the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected linebacker Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots as president. Rather than working with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though lack of funding {{prevented}} it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> {{of being able to}} sign with an AFL team to attain more money.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team. On July 11, 2008, Favre {{sent a letter to the}} Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet. While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} behind <b>the</b> use of <b>leveraged</b> and inverse ETFs is {{to obtain}} a multiple effect of the underlying index return for investors. In an efficient market, <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> ETF should move in multiples relative to its reference index. For example, a 3 x leveraged ETF should move three {{times the amount of}} the underlier. Based on the autocorrelation regressions, we found that <b>the</b> market for <b>leveraged</b> ETFs is not perfectly efficient in that the return of <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> ETF is not always identical to the listed multiple times the return of the underlying index. The size of such tracking error is found to be correlated with the low return of the underlying index and low volume of <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> ETF. Furthermore, <b>the</b> regression shows negative serial correlation between past errors and current errors, which indicates that errors tend to reverse themselves over time. This suggests that while there is a tendency for the return for <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> ETF to converge to the listed multiple of the return for the underlying index, the convergence is not always instantaneous. Instead, there is normally a time lag of several days for the discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>leveraged</b> ETF and <b>the</b> underlying index to gradually diminish...|$|R

5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent {{at a time when}} many producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR remains one of the world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|With {{no other}} way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $9.75 million in late 1954. While this gave DuMont a {{short-term}} cash infusion, it eliminated <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont executives realized the company could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations. On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 and later moved to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping {{what was left of the}} network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Ironically, Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS during the 1955-56 television season.|$|E

25|$|So long as Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov {{remained}} in power (until September 1727) {{the government of}} Elizabeth's adolescent half-nephew Peter II (reigned 1727-1730) treated her with liberality and distinction. The Dolgorukovs, an ancient boyar family, deeply resented Menshikov. With Peter II's attachment to Prince Ivan Dolgorukov, and with two of their family members on the Supreme State Council, they had <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> for a successful coup. Menshikov was arrested, stripped of all his honours and properties and exiled to northern Siberia where he died in November 1729. The Dolgorukovs hated the memory of Peter the Great and practically banished his daughter from Court.|$|E
25|$|Side-to-side {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a rolling motion because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling. The rudder had to be quite large not only to produce adequate roll {{but also because the}} fuselage was very short, reducing <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> of the rudder. The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds. This was not a big issue when the aircraft was designed because at that time aircraft were usually flown from large open fields allowing all take-offs and landings into wind.|$|E
25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, the rod acts as a catapult: by moving the rod forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) the rod and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and the fisherman strikes, the bending of the rod will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of the rod not only enables the fisherman to keep the line under tension, but the bending of the rod will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable the fisherman to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> by shortening the distance of the lever (the rod). A stiff rod will demand lots of power of the fisherman, while actually less power is put on the fish. In comparison, a deep bending rod will demand less power from the fisherman, but deliver more fighting power to the fish. In practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on the fisherman. In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> effect.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{examples}} cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. <b>The</b> <b>leverage</b> gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.|$|E
25|$|The wave-style breaststroke {{starts in}} a {{streamlined}} position, with shoulders shrugged to decrease drag in the water. While the conventional style is strongest at the outsweep, the wave-style puts {{much emphasis on}} the insweep, thus making the head rise later than in the conventional style. The wave-style pull is a circular motion with the hands accelerating to maximum speed and recovering {{in front of the}} chin, elbows staying at the surface and in front of the shoulders at all times. The high elbows creates <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> for the powerful torso and abdominal muscles to assist in the stroke. During the insweep, the swimmer accelerates their hands and hollows their back and lifts themself out of the water to breathe. To visualize, some say that the hands anchor themselves in the water while the hips thrust forward.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using <b>the</b> <b>leverage</b> of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E
