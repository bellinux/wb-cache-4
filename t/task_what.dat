There were both embarrassment and inspiration in the strange chance of snatching back for an hour a relinquished joy: the jump with which he found he could still rise to such an occasion took away his breath a little, {{at the same time}} that the idea--the idea of what one might make of such material--touched him with an irresistible wand. On the spot, to his inner vision, Miriam became a rich result, drawing a hundred formative forces out of their troubled sleep, defying him where he privately felt strongest and imposing herself triumphantly in her own strength. He had the good fortune, without striking matches, to see her, as a subject, in a vivid light, and his quick attempt was as exciting as a sudden gallop--he might have been astride, in a boundless field, of a runaway horse.|$|E

5000|$|Once data is uploaded, {{the system}} {{automatically}} allocates {{the work to}} contributors and tests them against known answers hidden within the <b>task</b> (<b>what</b> CrowdFlower refers to as a [...] "job" [...] ). The way in which contributors perform on these hidden test questions calibrates how much the system trusts them on an individual level. As long as contributors remain trusted they're allowed to continue working on a given job. If they become untrusted, they're removed from the job and all of their work is disregarded. Multiple contributor judgments are collected and an aggregate answer with an associated confidence score (agreement of the contributors weighted by the trust of each contributor) is provided as a result - effectively returning the [...] "most trusted judgment," [...] for a given unit of data.|$|E

50|$|Reading {{comprehension}} {{must also}} be investigated in terms of text difficulty. To assess this, researchers provide an easy and hard version of a reading task. During this task, participants are interrupted and asked whether their thoughts {{at the time of}} interruption had been related or unrelated to the <b>task.</b> <b>What</b> is found is that mind-wandering has a negative effect on text comprehension in more difficult readings. This supports the executive-resource hypothesis which describes that both task related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUT) compete for executive function resources. Therefore, when the primary task is difficult, little resources are available for mind-wandering, whereas when the task is simple, the possibility for mind-wandering is abundant because it takes little executive control to focus on simple tasks. However, mind-wandering tends to occur more frequently in harder readings as opposed to easier readings. Therefore, it is possible that similar to retention, mind-wandering increases when readers have difficulty constructing a model of the story.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between these measurements which involves measures of activation vs. measures of association. Measures of association are involved with the Implicit Association Task and Semantic priming. This is a measure of association because they are normally given choices and they are measured based on the association between them and the choices in the <b>task.</b> <b>What</b> they choose is associated to their previous experience because they are usually choosing between a pair; or more choices. However measures of activation which includes word completion and unprimed lexical decision tasks are both associated with activating the implicit stereotype. This means that although the person that is being involved in the research may not be aware what they are being measured on, they are measured based on the activation of a stereotype at that time. This can also be associated with previous experiences but can change previous thoughts based on the activation of potentially new implicit stereotypes.|$|E

[...] "The British Government wants to have the support of personalities and leaders like you in this <b>task,</b> <b>what</b> is your response?" [...] Mahmud Pasha replied: [...] "my answer is full rejection for the following reasons: firstly, I do not think your intentions towards the Kurdish people are sincere, if your goal is to serve the Kurds and save them from the cruelties as stated, you can be sure that, even without my support, there will be hundreds who will be willing to help you and certainly will succeed." [...] The second reason is that I am a Muslim, my religion prevents me from cooperating against my brothers in religion. The third reason is my old age, disability, and inability to take action".After this meeting, the British began pressuring Mahmud Pasha Jaff, imposing heavy taxes on the Kurds, for his physical condition. Finally, he died in 1921 and was buried in the mosque of the city of Saedeia.|$|E
