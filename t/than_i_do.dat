McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded his fist {{on his desk and}} admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this damn desk,” he shouted.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau, who {{had been}} so {{critical}} of Pleasures of the Harbor and Ochs's guitar skills eight years earlier, wrote warmly of Ochs in his obituary in The Village Voice. [...] "I came around to liking Phil Ochs' music, guitar included," [...] Christgau wrote. [...] "My affection [...] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [...] that many observers who care more for folk music <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor {{as close to the}} peak of the genre." ...|$|E

It was {{replaced}} with a scene where Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack or not. In it, Truman asserts that dropping the bomb will shorten the war, and a [...] "year less of war will mean life for... from 300,000 to half a million of America's finest youth".|$|E

No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works.

500|$|In the Georgia game Bomar had a brain {{hemorrhage}} {{after he}} was kicked in the chin, and half his body was paralyzed for two days. It was thought {{that he would never}} play football again: [...] "Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes", and Bomar sat on the bench {{for the rest of the}} season's games. Known as a devastating blocker and [...] "lightning fast," [...] he was the first Commodore football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. At his induction Bomar said, [...] "I just wish all the men who played with me at Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award.

In the very few {{interviews}} I've made, it doesn't matter how long we've talked to each other, the headline is still just about my paycheck." [...] After extensive media coverage of his earnings, PewDiePie posted a video, expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income. In the video he claimed, [...] "We did raise a million dollars for charity, and very few articles picked up on that, but here it is everywhere how much money I make", adding, [...] "It seems like the whole world cares more {{about how much money}} I make <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> myself." [...] Relating to his source of his income, PewDiePie stated: [...] "I think that's what's cool about YouTube: That anyone could technically do it, right?

500|$|During {{their time}} in Jacksonville, the McCains' {{marriage}} began to falter. [...] McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. [...] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. [...] McCain later said, [...] "My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that [...] "I attribute [...] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to anything else." [...] John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to John McCain, [...] "I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{found that}} the locals whom he spoke to [...] many of whom remembered Murrell from several decades before [...] found the cunning man to be [...] "a white and lawful wizard, who warred against the powers of {{darkness}} with all his might"; they added that it was [...] "no sin to employ the arts of a man like him". Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and a bad man. He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do...</b> He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't {{make up my mind}} which." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species on November24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, {{with some}} having {{been sent to}} America via ship; one of those was for Gray. Gray's copy arrived just before Christmas, and he read it between Christmas and New Year's. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties {{were not required to}} be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of On the Origin of Species and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin's behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was so grateful for Gray's efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book Forms of Flowers (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, [...] "there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> yours." [...] Seeing the [...] "unity we perceive in nature" [...] and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt [...] "that they not only had a Creator but have a Governor." [...] Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin's theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz' increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866 Agassiz apologized to Gray and the two were at least civil to one another again.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sondheim, he {{was asked}} to {{translate}} Mahagonny-Songspiel: [...] "But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> his stuff before... I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America – when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway."

2500|$|Darwin's cousin William Darwin Fox {{continued}} to give hims strong support, warning him against overworking on his huge book and recommending a holiday, but Darwin was immersed in his experiments and his writing.

2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't know anyone who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do....</b> Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E
