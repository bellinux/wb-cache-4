5000|$|In {{the lead}} up to the 2005 Cronulla riots in Cronulla, Koby Abberton spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the assault of a {{lifeguard}} that sparked the incident, claiming:"The reason why it's not happening at Maroubra {{is because of the}} Bra Boys.

If these fellas come out to Maroubra and start something they know it's going to be on, so they stay away."Members of the Bra Boys joined in the racial violence when the riots spread to Maroubra soon afterwards. Afterwards the Abberton brothers then held a joint media conference with members the Comanchero Motorcycle Club (a bikie gang, who include many Lebanese as their members) to help ease tensions, declaring peace.

5000|$|We've got a Labrador puppy {{who is a}} runt, the runt of a litter. We {{bought her}} along a {{roadside}} in a little pet shop, {{out in the country}} one day. She {{was a bit of a}} wild dog, a wild girl who wouldn't stay in. We have a big wall around our house in London, and she wouldn't stay in, she always used to jump the wall. She'd go out on the town for the evening, like Lady and the Tramp. She must have met up with some big black Labrador or something. She came back one day pregnant. She proceeded to walk into the garage and have this litter... Seven little black puppies, perfect little black Labradors, and she's not black, she's tan. So we worked out it must have been a black Labrador. What we do is if either of the dogs we have has a litter, we try to keep them for the puppy stage, so we get the best bit of them, and then when they get a bit unmanageable we ask people if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> puppy. So Jet was one of the puppies. We give them all names. We've had some great names, there was one puppy called Golden Molasses. I rather like that.

5000|$|The Abberton {{brothers}} and numerous {{members of the}} Bra Boys received negative coverage in Australian media following the racially charged 2005 Sydney race riots originating between opposing ethnic mobs on Cronulla beach. The negative media coverage motivated further rioting of the same racially charged nature on a string of other popular Sydney beaches, said to {{be an attempt to}} address the reported incidents of assaults and intimidatory behavior by groups of non-locals, some of whom were identified in earlier media reports as youths of Middle Eastern appearance from the suburbs of Western Sydney. In the lead up to the riots, Abberton spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the assault of a lifeguard that sparked the incident, claiming:"The reason why it's not happening at Maroubra is because of the Bra Boys. Girls go to Cronulla, Bondi, everywhere else in Sydney and get harassed, but they come to Maroubra and nothing happens to them.

If these fellas come out to Maroubra and start something they know it's going to be on, so they stay away."Following the riots, in which the Bra Boys did not claim any involvement, Maroubra was the target of retaliation by Middle Eastern gangs. The Abberton brothers then held well-publicised meetings with other groups to help ease tensions. [...] "I think that this is the start, the boys have agreed to come down and talk to us, to start some dialogue between the groups, you know, to try and ease some tension", said Sunny Abberton in a group interview on The 7.30 Report. Koby Abberton, his brothers, and other member of the Bra Boys were labeled as playing catalyst to the riots with Abberton singled out as the main culprit. Later, Abberton disputed the claims that he had attempted to fuel the riots, going on to tell The Sydney Morning Herald that he was [...] "ashamed to be Australian that day" [...] and had attempted, alongside his {{brothers and}} other Bra Boys to deflect and suppress the racially charged riots.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the issues}} of regulatory reform in the energy industry of post- Soviet countries. We identify {{the characteristics of the}} transformation that these countries go through: it is the introduction of a) a new legal culture and b) a capitalist rationality of production in societies embedded in a post-Soviet institutional context. We identify existing models to which these countries' regulations could adhere. Though the industries claim to adopt an Anglo-Saxon approach, one observes in reality the emergence of a specific, post-Soviet regulatory model, characterized by the legalisation of the quasi-proprietorial rights factually enjoyed by new political and economic elites. We review some specific aspects of regulatory reform in the energy sector in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakstan and Azerbaijan. We conclude that foreign investors, politicians and advisors have to adjust to the post-Soviet reality if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lasting impact. regulatory reform, energy, post-Soviet countries...|$|E
