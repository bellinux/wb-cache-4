Typically, the photopolymer consists of a polymer binder and a monomer in a 1 / 1 ratio together with a photo-initiator, which results in a solid and non-tacky material at room temperature. Here, new mixtures for photoembossing are presented which are potentially biocompatible.

The structural effect of a two-dimensional (2 D) ZrO 2 nanoparticle photonic crystal (PC) pattern on the extraction efficiency of photoluminescence (PL) from the underlying Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 + phosphor film was investigated.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the concepts of the chemical modification of polymer blends by reactive processing using interlinking agents (multi-functional, activated vinyl compounds; <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylates</b> {TRIS} and divinylbenzene {DVD}) to target in-situ interpolymer formation between immiscible polymers in PS/EPDM blends via peroxide-initiated free radical reactions during melt mixing. From a comprehensive survey of previous studies of compatibility enhancement in polystyrene blends, it was recognised that reactive processing offers opportunities for technological success that have not yet been fully realised; learning from this study is expected to assist in the development and application of this potential. In an experimental-scale operation for the simultaneous melt blending and reactive processing of both polymers, involving manual injection of precise reactive agent/free radical initiator mixtures directly into molten polymer within an internal mixer, torque changes were distinct, quantifiable and rationalised by ongoing physical and chemical effects. EPDM content of PS/EPDM blends was the prime determinant of torque increases on addition of TRIS, itself liable to self-polymerisation at high additions, with little indication of PS reaction in initial reactively processed blends with TRIS, though blend compatibility, from visual assessment of morphology by SEM, was nevertheless improved. Suitable operating windows were defined for the optimisation of reactive blending, for use once routes to encourage PS reaction could be identified. The effectiveness of PS modification by reactive processing with interlinking agents was increased by the selection of process conditions to target specific reaction routes, assessed by spectroscopy (FT-IR and NMR) and thermal analysis (DSC) coupled dichloromethane extraction and fractionation of PS. Initiator concentration was crucial in balancing desired PS modification and interlinking agent self-polymerisation, most particularly with TRIS. Pre-addition of initiator to PS was beneficial in the enhancement of TRIS binding to PS and minimisation of modifier polymerisation; believed to arise from direct formation of polystyryl radicals for addition to active unsaturation in TRIS. DVB was found to be a "compatible" modifier for PS, but its efficacy was not quantified. Application of routes for PS reaction in PS/EPDM blends was successful for in-situ formation of interpolymer (shown by sequential solvent extraction combined with FT-IR and DSC analysis); the predominant outcome depending on the degree of reaction of each component, with optimum "between-phase" interpolymer formed under conditions selected for equalisation of differing component reactivities and avoidance of competitive processes. This was achieved for combined addition of TRIS+DVB at optimum initiator concentrations with initiator pre-addition to PS. Improvements in blend compatibility (by tensiles, SEM and thermal analysis) were shown in all cases with significant interpolymer formation, though physical benefits were not; morphology and other reactive effects were also important factors. Interpolymer from specific "between-phase" reaction of blend components and interlinking agent was vital for the realisation of positive performance on compatibilisation by the chemical modification of polymer blends by reactive processing...|$|R
40|$|Failures of {{vascular}} grafts {{are normally}} {{caused by the}} lack of a durable and adherent endothelium covering the graft which leads to thrombus and neointima formation. A promising approach to overcome these issues is to create a functional, quiescent monolayer of endothelial cells on the surface of implants. The present study reports {{for the first time on}} the use of photoembossing as a technique to create polymer films with different topographical features for improved cell interaction in biomedical applications. For this, a photopolymer is created by mixing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and <b>trimethylolpropane</b> ethoxylate <b>triacrylate</b> (TPETA) at a 1 : 1 ratio. This photopolymer demonstrated an improvement in biocompatibility over PMMA which is already known to be biocompatible and has been extensively used in the biomedical field. Additionally, photoembossed films showed significantly improved cell attachment and proliferation compared to their non-embossed counterparts. Surface texturing consisted of grooves of different pitches (6, 10, and 20 µm) and heights (1 µm and 2. 5 µm). The 20 µm pitch photoembossed films significantly accelerated cell migration in a wound-healing assay, while films with a 6 µm pitch inhibited cells from detaching. Additionally, the relief structure obtained by photoembossing also changed the surface wettability of the substrates. Photoembossed PMMA-TPETA systems benefited from this change as it improved their water contact angle to around 70 °, making it well suited for cell adhesion...|$|R

This chemical/structural uniqueness of the PC-CPE brings remarkable improvement in mechanical flexibility and thermal stability, as compared to conventional carbonate-based liquid electrolytes that are fluidic and volatile. In addition, the PC-CPE precursor mixture (i. e., prior to UV irradiation) with well-adjusted rheological properties, via collaboration with a UV-assisted imprint lithography technique, produces the micropatterned PC-CPE with tunable dimensions. Notably, the cell incorporating the self-standing PC-CPE, which acts as a thermally stable electrolyte and also a separator membrane, maintains stable charge/discharge behavior even after exposure to thermal shock condition (= 130 °C/ 0. 5 h), while a control cell assembled with a carbonate-based liquid electrolyte and a polyethylene separator membrane loses electrochemical activity. close 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRubber is {{a widely}} {{available}} potential carbon neutral resource, both as native natural rubber state and as vulcanized state in waste tires. Herein, we describe a model synthesis of acrylate telechelic natural rubber (AcTNR) oligomers {{and the use of}} such oligomers to prepare novel acrylate resins. AcTNR oligomers are synthesized according to a two steps procedure implying a controlled C[*]=[*]C bond's scission of high-molecular-weight natural rubber and a further chain ends functionalization. The molar mass of the resulting AcTNR is found to be 2300 g/mol as determined by 1 H NMR. AcTNR-based resins are then prepared by mixing AcTNR oligomers with various reactive diluents (RD) such as styrene, 1, 4 -butanediol ether, tri(propylene glycol) diacrylate, 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate, <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (AcTNR:RD weight ratio 7 : 3). These bio-based resins are afterward cured in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide as initiator and cobalt octoate as accelerator at 80 [*]°C and postcured at 120 [*]°C. The cured resins offer a wide range of mechanical, thermal, and dynamic-mechanical performances. This approach could be extended to rubber tire wastes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

40|$|In this paper, {{itaconic acid}} was monomethylated with {{methanol}} to produce monomethyl itaconate, and then monomethyl itaconated epoxidized soybean oil (IESO) {{was obtained by}} melt ring-opening esterification of mono methyl itaconate with ESO. For comparison, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) was also synthesized from ESO and acrylic acid with the same synthetic method. The chemical structures of monomethyl itaconate, IESO, and AESO were characterized in detail by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), FTIR, and H- 1 NMR The isothermal thermogravimetric analysis at 30, 60, and 90 degrees C indicated that monomethyl itaconate exhibited extremely low volatility even at 90 degrees C, while acrylic acid volatilized very fast even at 30 degrees C, which suggested that monomethyl itaconate {{could be used as}} a green alternative to acrylic acid. Under UV radiation, IESO showed good copolymerization ability with reactive monomers such as glycidyl methacrylate modified itaconic acid (IG), <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (TMPTMA), and styrene. The cured neat IESO exhibited similar properties to the neat AESO, and the IESO/reactive monomers systems showed higher glass transition temperature (T-g), modulus, and comparable or better tensile strength and coating properties than the AESO/reactive monomers systems...|$|E
40|$|A facile {{approach}} to fabricate a highly bendable plastic crystal composite electrolyte (PCCE) {{for use in}} shape conformable all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries is demonstrated. This strategy is based on integration of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) matrix with a plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE, 1 M lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide in succinonitrile). In comparison to conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, salient benefits of the PCE are the thermal stability and nonflammability, which show promising potential as a safer electrolyte. The semi-IPN matrix in the PCCE is composed of a UV (ultraviolet) -crosslinked ethoxylated <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> polymer network and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (as a linear polymer). Solid electrolyte properties of the PCCE are investigated in terms of plastic crystal behavior, mechanical bendability, and ionic transport. Owing {{to the presence of}} the anomalous semi-IPN matrix, the PCCE exhibits unprecedented improvement in bendability, along with affording high ionic conductivity. Based on this understanding of the PCCE characteristics, feasibility of applying the PCCE to solid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries is explored. The facile ionic transport of the PCCE, in conjunction with suppressed growth of cell impedance during cycling, plays a crucial role in providing excellence in cell performance. These advantageous features of the PCCE are further discussed with an in-depth consideration of the semi-IPN matrix architecture and its specific interaction with the PCE. close 282...|$|E
40|$|A {{new class}} of highly thin, deformable, and safety-reinforced plastic crystal polymer {{electrolytes}} (N-PCPEs) is demonstrated as an innovative solid electrolyte for potential use in high-performance flexible lithium-ion batteries with aesthetic versatility and robust safety. The unusual N-PCPEs are fabricated by combining a plastic crystal polymer electrolyte with a porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nonwoven. Herein, the three-dimensional reticulated plastic crystal polymer electrolyte matrix is formed directly inside the PET nonwoven skeleton via in-situ UV-crosslinking of ethoxylated <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (ETPTA) monomer, under co-presence of plastic crystal electrolyte. The PET nonwoven is incorporated as a compliant skeleton to enhance mechanical/dimensional strength of N-PCPE. Owing to this structural uniqueness, the N-PCPE shows significant improvements in the film thickness and deformability with maintaining advantageous features (such as high ionic conductivity and thermal stability) of the PCE. Based on structural/physicochemical characterization of N-PCPE, its potential application as a solid electrolyte for flexible lithium-ion batteries is explored by scrutinizing the electrochemical performance of cells. The high ionic conductance of N-PCPE, along with its excellent deformability, plays a viable role in improving cell performance (particularly at high current densities and also mechanically deformed states). Notably, the cell assembled with N-PCPE exhibits stable electrochemical performance even under a severely wrinkled state, without suffering from internal short-circuit failures between electrodes. close 5...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a facile approach to fabrication of a self-standing plastic crystal composite electrolyte for a lithium-ion battery, wherein UV (ultraviolet) -cured ethoxylated <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (ETPTA) networks {{are incorporated into}} a plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE, 1 M lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimide (LiTFSI) in succinonitrile (SN)). An ETPTA monomer having trifunctional groups is successfully crosslinked within a very short UV-exposure time of 20 s without using any solvent, leading {{to the formation of}} a self-standing, transparent, and non-sticky plastic crystal composite electrolyte (X-PCCE). Owing to the introduction of the UV-cured ETPTA networks, the X-PCCE is capable of providing unprecedentedly robust mechanical strength even at a high concentration of PCE (i. e., ETPTA/PCE = 15 / 85 %, w/w), along with affording high ionic conductivity. In contrast, a conventional plastic crystal composite electrolyte (F-PCCE) comprising polyvinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) and PCE is difficult to be fabricated as a self-standing film and easily deformed by weak external stress. Notably, the X-PCCE shows significant improvement in electrochemical stability and interfacial resistance toward lithium metal electrodes. Ionic conductivities of the X-PCCE and the F-PCCE are examined as a function of temperature and discussed under consideration of the interaction between SN, LiTFSI, and polymers in the plastic crystal composite electrolytes. close 131...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe photoredox {{catalysis}} {{applied to}} the field of polymers and more particularly to the design of photoinitiating systems is briefly reviewed. Two novel phenylisoquinoline-based iridium complexes with fluorine substituents (bis[5 -fluoro- 2 -(1 -isoquinolinyl-κN) phenyl-κC](2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 3, 5 -heptanedionato-κO 3,κO 5) -iridium (III) (Ir_b) and bis[3, 5 -difluoro- 2 -(1 -isoquinolinyl-κN) phenyl-κC](2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 3, 5 -heptanedionato-κO 3,κO 5) -iridium (III) (Ir_c) are proposed as photoredox catalysts (also called photoinitiator catalysts) and incorporated into suitable photoinitiating systems for cationic and radical polymerization. (3, 4 -Epoxycyclohexane) methyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX) and <b>trimethylolpropane</b> <b>triacrylate</b> (TMPTA) were used as benchmark monomers for cationic and radical photopolymerization. These new catalysts are compared to our very recently proposed unsubstituted catalyst compound: bis[2 -(1 -isoquinolinyl-κN) phenyl-κC](2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 3, 5 -heptanedionato-κO 3,κO 5) -iridium (III) (Ir_a). Remarkably, these catalysts exhibit improved light absorption properties and are characterized by a panchromatic behavior which ensures the photosensitivity of the polymerizable films to blue, green and red lights. The photochemical properties as well as the chemical mechanisms associated with these catalysts are investigated by ESR spin-trapping, laser flash photolysis, steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry and luminescence experiments. The structure/reactivity relationships as well as the substitution effect (by the fluorine) are discussed...|$|E
