5|$|Passenger numbers fell {{during the}} 1960s, {{and the line}} became {{economically}} unviable. Following a train crash in 1965, the owners closed <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of September that year. The tunnel still exists, but no trace remains of the stations.|$|E
5|$|All three {{captured}} {{ships were}} taken into the Royal Navy. The name of Alexandre reverted to the former Alexander, and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by Alexanders presence in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball. Tigre retained her French name, while Formidable, as there was already a ship of that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS Belleisle, apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. Belleisle had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.|$|E
5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} the rails before smashing into a building. The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 1965 holiday season.

5|$|In 1895, the MS {{put forward}} a bill to Parliament to build two tracks from Wembley Park to Canfield Place, near Finchley Road station, to allow its express trains to pass the Met's {{stopping}} service. The Met protested before {{it was agreed that}} it would build the lines for the MS's exclusive use. When rebuilding bridges over the lines from Wembley Park to Harrow for the MS, seeing a future need the Met quadrupled <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time and the MS requested exclusive use of two tracks. The MS had the necessary authority to connect to the Circle at Marylebone, but the Met suggested onerous terms. At the time the MS was running short of money and abandoned the link.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1998, Hatfield Government Station opened {{along with}} the Westside MAX line.

5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a curve in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{had spent most of}} their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S and 5C {{sold over}} nine million {{units in the}} first three days, setting a record for first weekend {{smartphone}} sales, with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C.

5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{penetration}} to the north, the retreating 34th Infantry moved south to Nonsan. On July 15, the 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by troops from the Republic of Korea Army. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops {{on the west side}} of the river. At 03:00 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of the 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.|$|E

5|$|Following {{their victory}} in the main event Los Infernales ended up facing off against and {{defeating}} the reigning Mexican National Trios Champions, Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari at CMLL's next major event, Sin Piedad ("No Mercy"), although the championship was not on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. They were later able to use their non-title victory to be granted a championship match, winning the Mexican National Trios Championship on June 23, 2003. Los Nuevo Infernales reign as champions lasted 96 days, until they were defeated by La Familia de Tijuana (Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario) on September 27, 2003. Averno and Mephisto turned on El Satánico shortly after the championship loss and formed their own group known as La Trada del Terror (the trio of terror) along with Ephesto, {{putting an end to}} Los Infernales just over a year after they won the rights to the name.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa.

A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella.

5|$|In the 18th century turnpikes {{arrived in}} the area and then in the 19th {{communications}} improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|E

Trulli, Webber, Glock and Alonso rounded out the top ten, after Glock's Toyota held off a quick Alonso late in the race. Barrichello and Fisichella finished strongly, ahead of Hamilton, who managed only 13th. Nakajima, Bourdais, Davidson and Sato took the next four places; Coulthard and Sutil finished last on track after their respective crashes demoted them {{to the back of the}} field.

5|$|Nelson was {{a highly}} {{experienced}} officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and {{had been forced to}} return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, {{most of the}} Union troops {{departed}} Fort Henry, {{where they}} were waiting for the return of Union gunboats and the arrival of additional troops that would increase the Union forces to about 25,000 men. The Union forces proceeded about 5 miles (8km) on the two main roads leading between the two forts. They were delayed most of the day by a cavalry screen commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest's troops, sent out by Buckner, spotted a detachment from McClernand's division and opened fire against them. A brief skirmish ensued until orders from Buckner arrived to fall back within the entrenchments. After this withdrawal of Forrest's cavalry, the Union troops moved closer to the Confederate defense line while trying to cover any possible Confederate escape routes. McClernand's division made up the right of Grant's army with C.F. Smith's division forming the left. USS Carondelet was the first gunboat to arrive up the river, and she promptly fired numerous shells into the fort, testing its defenses before retiring. Grant arrived on February 12 and established his headquarters near {{the left side of the}} front of <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Widow Crisp's house.|$|E
