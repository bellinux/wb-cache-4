5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping <b>their</b> <b>students</b> understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing <b>their</b> <b>students</b> about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise <b>their</b> <b>students</b> to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with <b>their</b> <b>students,</b> and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to <b>their</b> <b>students</b> reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E

Classroom supervising teachers rated <b>their</b> <b>student</b> teachers on those same teaching competencies {{at the conclusion of}} student teaching. An analysis of mean ratings revealed that student teachers perceived themselves as being highly adequate to teach following <b>their</b> <b>student</b> teaching experience. Post-student teaching ratings by student teachers and by classroom supervising teachers revealed a moderate, positive relationship.

5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to <b>their</b> <b>students,</b> while private schools generally require <b>their</b> <b>students</b> {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010.

Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place <b>their</b> <b>students</b> in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as secretary, Zahorchak {{implemented}} state funding for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, developed a new school funding formula, helped increase education funding for school districts, and established the Keystone Exams and the state's Standards Aligned System. In 2010, Zahorchak announced he would leave the Secretary of Education position, coinciding with Rendell's pending departure from the governorship. On April 22, 2010, Zahorchak was selected to be superintendent of the Allentown School District in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he vowed to establish regular updates to families about <b>their</b> <b>students</b> education, improve safety in schools and implement incentives to attract qualified minorities and top education students into teaching positions.|$|E

5|$|Fordham's {{undergraduate}} schools all offer honors {{programs for}} <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> The programs' curricula are modified {{versions of the}} Core Curriculum. For example, the Fordham College Honors Program offers a Great Books curriculum with seminar-style classes and a senior research thesis in each student's major. Most honors students are inducted into the programs upon admission to the university, though some are invited {{at the end of}} their first year. Each program has a designated study space for its members, including Alpha House for the Fordham College Honors Program and the honors wing of Hughes Hall for the Global Business Honors Program. Upon graduating from the university, honors students receive the designation of in cursu honorum on their diploma and transcripts.|$|E
5|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in 1871 by the English philanthropist Thomas Rhodes Armitage and the American anti-slavery campaigner Francis Joseph Campbell, who lost his sight as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London {{would be a more}} suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide <b>their</b> <b>students</b> with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has {{been regarded as}} being elitist by some commentators, taking 41% of its undergraduate students from non-state schools, {{according to the most}} recent 2009/2010 figures, despite the fact that such pupils make up just 7% of the population and 18% of 16+ year old pupils across the UK. The intake of state school pupils at Bristol is lower than many Oxbridge colleges. The high ratio of undergraduates from non-state school has led to some tension at the university. In late February and early March 2003, Bristol became embroiled in a row about admissions policies, with some private schools threatening a boycott based on their claims that, in an effort to improve equality of access, the university was discriminating against <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> These claims were hotly denied by the university.|$|E

5|$|University College was the {{founding}} nondenominational college, created in 1853 after {{the university was}} secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged <b>their</b> <b>students</b> to study for non-divinity degrees at University College. In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join. Decades {{after the death of}} John Strachan, the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904, followed in 1910 by St. Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college founded by the Basilian Fathers. Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton, and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting <b>their</b> <b>students</b> should continue to paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E

5|$|Queen's University has {{a number}} of {{athletic}} facilities open to both their varsity teams as well as to <b>their</b> <b>students.</b> The stadium with the largest seating capacity at Queen's is Richardson Memorial Stadium. Built in 1971, the stadium seats 8,500 and is home to the varsity football team. The stadium has also played host for a number of international games including Canada's second round 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification games and the inaugural match for the Colonial Cup, an international rugby league challenge match. The stadium is set to re-open for its inaugural football game on September 17, 2016 after an extensive revitalization. Other athletic facilities at Queen's include the Athletic and Recreation Centre, which houses a number of gymnasiums and pools; Tindall Field, a multi-season playing field and jogging track; Nixon Field, home to the school's rugby teams; and West Campus Fields, which is used by a number of varsity teams and student intramural leagues.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach <b>their</b> <b>students</b> how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E
5|$|The Economist Intelligence Unit, the {{business}} information {{arm of the}} Economist Group, gathered results from two internet questionnaires, one of business schools and one of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. Information provided by the schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and alumni network. Results were tabulated using a smoothing method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, {{with the result that}} some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.|$|E
