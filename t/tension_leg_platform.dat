40|$|Offshore <b>Tension</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>Platforms</b> (TLPs) are {{extensively}} {{used for}} petroleum extraction in deep sea. Response behavior of TLP under hydro-dynamic loading is nonlinear due to large structural displacements and fluid-structure interaction. This study focuses on influence of two imperative parameters namely inertia coefficient and wave directionality on its geometry. Paper develops a mathematical formulation for non-linear variation of hydrodynamic inertia coefficient (Cm) {{along the water}} depth to yield optimum force on TLPs as well as influence of wave directionality on their geometric configuration while discussing the method of solution.

40|$|Wave drift {{responses}} at {{low frequencies}} and springing at high frequencies can both be modelled as second order processes involving terms {{proportional to the}} square of the wave elevation in irregular seas. Although the models of both these phenomena share many common features, springing introduces several additional complexities. These concern both the second order hydrodynamic analysis, and the probabilistic modelling of the resulting first plus second order response. This article highlights these in the context of springing, which is particularly relevant to the design of <b>Tension</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>Platforms</b> and offshore structures susceptible to lightly damped resonant responses, at periods in the range from around 2 to 5 seconds. The three closely linked aspects of hydrodynamics, spectral analysis and probabilistic modelling are considered, and sample numerical results discussed.

50|$|A tension-leg {{platform}} (TLP) or extended <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platform</b> (ETLP) is a vertically moored {{floating structure}} normally {{used for the}} offshore production of oil or gas, and is particularly suited for water depths greater than 300 metres (about 1000 ft) and less than 1500 metres (about 4900 ft). Use of tension-leg platforms has also been proposed for wind turbines.|$|E
50|$|TLPs {{have been}} in use since the early 1980s. The first <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platform</b> was built for Conoco's Hutton field in the North Sea in the early 1980s. The hull {{was built in the}} dry-dock at Highland Fabricator's Nigg yard in the north of Scotland, with the deck section built nearby at McDermott's yard at Ardersier. The two parts were mated in the Moray Firth in 1984.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Tension</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>Platform</b> is a buoyant platform, {{which is}} {{held in place by}} a mooring system. TLP mooring is {{different}} to conventional chained or wire mooring systems. The platform {{is held in}} place with large steel tendons fastened to the sea floor. Those tendons are held in tension by the buoyancy of the hull. Statoil's Heidrun TLP is the only one with a concrete hull, all other TLPs have steel hulls.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>Platforms</b> {{have proven}} their {{abilities}} for moderate water depths {{and are now}} being used for deep water and ultra deepwater. A number of issues in design, operation and inspection issues however {{still need to be}} resolved. Such issues are: â€¢ Actual wind (hurricane), wave and (loop) current conditions, â€¢ Platform motions (LF, WF and HF), â€¢ Tensions in tendons and risers, â€¢ VIV behavior of tendons and risers (including effect of fairings and strakes), â€¢ Extreme loads and fatigue life of the platform. In 2004 the Marco Polo TLP has been installed in 4300 ft of water in the GoM. In order to collect data to resolve the above issues, the partners in the Marco Polo TLP project decided to install a monitoring system on the platform. More specifically the envisaged monitoring campaign was aiming at: â€¢ Damping in the stiff modes of motion, â€¢ Platform behavior in loop current, â€¢ Effect of strakes on risers and fairings on tendons to restrict VIV...|$|R
40|$|Skirted {{foundations}} {{are considered}} to be a viable foundation for a variety of offshore applications. Skirted foundations are used widely offshore, either as a single foundation system for gravity based structures or as discrete foundation units at the corners of jacket structures and <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platforms</b> Smooth skirted foundations exhibited lesser bearing capacity and settlement values at failure than the rough skirted foundations at similar conditions. The enhancement in bearing capacity of skirted foundations occurred both with the increase in skirt depth and relative density of sand. The ultimate bearing capacity was found to increase with the size of the footing, the length of skirts and the relative density of sand. The failure strain is found to increase with the size of the footings and skirt length but decreases with increase in relative density of sand bed. In horizontal loading test at higher relative density the stress reaches to a peak value at low strain and sudden failure occurs. But at lower relative density the peak stress occurs at relatively high strain...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platforms</b> {{for deep}} water oil {{recovery}} {{has increased the}} importance of accurately predicting the effects of wind on these structures. The gust loading factor approach incorporates the effect of deviations from mean wind speed, gustiness, on structures based on extreme value statistics. Single-point representation f the wind field may be employed for structures smaller than typical gust size, but partial wind velocity correlation over large structures necessitates the use of multi-point wind field statistics to determine dynamic load effects. The characteristics of the wind field over the ocean are reviewed, and a previously reported description of an ocean-based wind spectrum is further examined {{in the light of}} additional full-scale offshore measurements. A modified coherence function for offshore applications i presented based on theoretical considerations and experimental data. A random vibration-based formulation of gust loading factors is presented that accounts for the hydrodynamic damping imparted by the platform motions in waves and currents. The response statistics of an offshore platform are predicted in the light of para. metric uncertainties bya Monte Carlo simulation using the gust loading factor approach. This is used as the basis for a reliability analysis of the platform...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} {{is made of}} 57 individual sections that were built on land at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard on Pier 70 and towed out into the bay by a large catamaran barge. After the steel shell was completed, water-tight bulkheads were fitted and concrete was poured to form the 2.3 ft-thick interior walls and track bed. They were then floated into place (positioned above where they were to sit), and the barge was tethered to the Bay floor, acting as a temporary <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platform.</b> The section was ballasted with 500 ST of gravel before being lowered into a trench packed with soft soil, mud, and gravel for leveling along the Bay's bottom. Once the section was in place, divers connected the section with the sections {{that had already been}} placed underwater, the bulkheads between placed sections were removed and a protective layer of sand and gravel was packed against the sides. Cathodic protection was provided to resist corrosive action from the Bay's salt water.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>Platforms</b> (TLP) {{have started}} to become popular {{structures}} both in offshore oil extraction and wind energy sectors. A challenging topic in this field has arisen by the adoption of TLP based wind turbines (TLPWT) into intermediate water depths. In this study, a TLPWT has been geometrically optimized for the coordinates of 03 Â°E 56 Â°N offshore of UK in the North Sea. Focused on the exciting wave forces, an optimization {{has been carried out}} to find out the geometrical shape yielding least wave forces on the structure, which depict the fundamental force component under the defined circumstances. The structural dimensions of the TLP have been obtained by solving for the least displacement and satisfying the limits for natural frequency and surge displacement values and it has been found that an 8567 tonnes of displacement is optimum. Based on the result achieved and related structural dimensions stated below, it can be concluded that TLPWTs are far from being feasible in shallow regions, where the main limitation rises due to the drastical reduction in the surge natural frequency of the structure in intermediate and shallow water depths...|$|R
40|$|The Constitution Truss Spar, {{operated}} by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC), {{is located in}} Green Canyon Block 679 and 680 in a water depth of 1, 500 m. It was installed in October of 2006 and has since weathered multiple hurricanes and other storms. The platform is equipped with an Environmental Platform Response Monitoring System (EPRMS) which records real-time motions, environmental parameters and loads. These measurements were used to hind-cast the platform mooring tensions and estimate fatigue damage index accrued over the short life (install to start of study, July 2010) of the platform. The study found that extreme events such as Hurricane Ike (~ 100 yr storm) accounted for considerably higher fatigue damage index than the total caused by other small storms {{likely to occur in}} the 20 year service life of the vessel. It is therefore a recommendation of this study that a design criterion for fatigue damage accrued during extreme events such as 100 yr hurricanes be considered in the design of station keeping systems in a similar manner to the guidelines found in API RP 2 T (2010) for design of <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vibrations {{in marine}} {{offshore}} marine structures, due to various environmental loads, can reduce platform productivity, endanger safety, affect serviceability {{of the structure}} and have been attributing factors in several major accidents and failures in the marine and offshore industry {{over the last few}} decades. Controlling the vibrations in marine offshore structures potentially due to self-excited nonlinear hydrodynamic forces, large deformations and highly nonlinear responses, is challenging. While general vibration control strategies have been investigated and demonstrated to be effective for structural vibration mitigation, there currently is limited research highlighting the specific methods available for design engineers and researchers concerned with vibrations of marine offshore structures. This paper provides a review of vibration control techniques and their application for marine offshore structures. Initially, a review of the general approaches following the conventional categorization of passive, active, semi-active and hybrid is presented. This is then followed by a review of the specific marine offshore vibration control methods and a comparison of the approaches. The marine offshore structures considered in this review include jacket structures, <b>tension</b> <b>leg</b> <b>platforms</b> (TLPs), spar structures, floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) and riser structures. It can be found that the general trend is progressing towards semi-active and hybrid vibration control from passive or active control, as they provide more practical approaches for implementation, possessing the advantages of passive and active control systems...|$|R
