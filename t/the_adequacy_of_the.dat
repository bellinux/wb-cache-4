Cutting forces provide the basis for surface accuracy prediction and improvement, tool wear rate, the energy consumption within the machine tool, depending on power consumption and operating time. In this work, second-order quadratic models were developed for Fx, Fy and Fz considering the spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and immersion angle as the cutting parameters, using central composite rotatable design. <b>The</b> <b>adequacies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models were checked using ANOVA.

500|$|The stretch between Reading and Newbury was {{completed}} on 17 July 1990; {{at a ceremony}} held at Monkey Marsh Lock several boats competed {{to be the first}} craft through. Concerns about <b>the</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water supply still remained when Queen Elizabeth II formally reopened the canal on 8 August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust's boat Rose of Hungerford through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them. The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of £1million. The pumps raise water [...] at a rate of [...] per hour (380litres per second). In October 1996, the Kennet & Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single National Lottery grant awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, £25million towards a £29million project, to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations. The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites. The restoration's completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from HRH Prince Charles, but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004 the Dundas Aqueduct, which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct, was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the Great Western Railway with Bath Stone to match the original work.|$|E
