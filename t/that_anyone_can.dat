By rubbing a pencil over the envelope containing the tape case, Mulder finds a phone number which connects him to the Syndicate's office. Mulder speaks to the Well-Manicured Man, who offers to meet with him. The Well-Manicured Man tells Mulder that a UFO was sunk during World War II and that a cover story of a sunken atomic bomb was used to cover up its attempted recovery. He reveals <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> be gotten to, causing Mulder to ask Scully to check on Skinner.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad asserts <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> renounce – {{this choice}} is entirely {{up to the}} individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E

25|$|Recent studies {{claim that}} obesity {{is a risk}} factor for {{hypertension}} because of activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in adipose tissue, and also linked renin-angiotensin system with insulin resistance, and claims <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> cause the other. Local production of angiotensin II in various tissues, including the blood vessels, heart, adrenals, and brain, is controlled by ACE and other enzymes, including the serine protease chymase. The activity of local renin–angiotensin systems and alternative pathways of angiotensin II formation may make an important contribution to remodeling of resistance vessels and the development of target organ damage (i.e. left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and arterial aneurysm) in hypertensive persons.|$|E

25|$|Task Review - The losing {{team are}} {{subjected}} to a more detailed, extensive review of their performance in the boardroom, with Lord Sugar and his advisers being more openly critical of any team member's performance on the task, particularly those who performed poorly or contributed very little, while candidates argue their case for staying in the competition, often highlighting others in their team and countering any criticism they receive that they feel is unfounded. Once discussions are brought to an end, the team's project manager for the task is asked to select two candidates from their team to accompany them into for a final boardroom discussion, {{with the power of}} their choice meaning <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> be selected, whether they were responsible for the failure of the task or considered to be by the PM, or are someone whom the PM has issues with such as personality clashes. Those not picked are sent back to the candidates' accommodation for that series, while Sugar and his advisers have a private discussion amongst themselves about the PM and their choices after the group are told to wait outside the boardroom; if the team only consists of two or three candidates, they are simply told to step outside {{at the end of the}} team's discussion period.|$|E

Lyrically, the single portrays Prince responding to questions regarding [...] "responsibility and honesty", in addition to him announcing that [...] "there is no more 'truth'" [...] left.

And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot—we dare not—let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial superiority." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million.

500|$|Priests {{are often}} termed godhi, while priestesses are gydhja, {{adopting}} Old Norse terms meaning [...] "god-man" [...] and [...] "god-woman" [...] respectively, with the plural term being gothar. These individuals are rarely seen as intermediaries between practitioners and deities, instead having {{the role of}} facilitating and leading group ceremonies and being learned in the lore and traditions of the religion. Many kindreds believe <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> take on the position of priest, with members sharing organisational duties and taking turns in leading the rites. In other groups, it is considered necessary for the individual to gain formal credentials from an accredited Heathen organisation {{in order to be}} recognised as a priest. In a few groups—particularly those of the early 20th century which operated as secret societies—the priesthood is modelled on an initiatory system of ascending degrees akin to Freemasonry.|$|E

500|$|... "Glitter in the Air" [...] is a pop ballad, co-written by Pink while {{produced}} by frequent collaborator Billy Mann.

According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Glitter in the Air" [...] is composed {{in the key}} of F major, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Pink's vocal range spans from the high-tone of B♭4 to the low-tone of F3. Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press commented that although the song did not display the power of Pink vocals, [...] "her voice is still potent, full of hurt and confusion <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> feel". The song's lyrics talk {{about the power of}} love and taking a leap in faith. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said the song [...] "reflect on life's simple joys and simply savor them just for what they are".|$|E
500|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, Dragon Quests {{widespread}} {{appeal is}} that it is [...] "made so <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests." [...] According to him, Dragon Quest is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but for those who want more there is still content for them to pursue.|$|E
