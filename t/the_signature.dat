5|$|In 2000, a 777-style interior, {{known as}} the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, <b>the</b> <b>Signature</b> Interior {{features}} even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with <b>the</b> <b>Signature</b> Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification {{known as the}} Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.|$|E

5|$|The {{electoral law}} {{provides}} that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors {{are allowed to}} present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors are required to secure at least <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of 1 per 100 of the electors entered in electoral register of the constituency {{for which they are}} seeking election—0.1 per 100 and, at least, <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of 500 electors, until 1985—.

Electors are barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days from the election call.|$|E
5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} {{is invalid}} if the passport is not signed, and normally the bearer affixes his/her signature on <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> field, whose position has varied with various incarnations of Lebanese passports.

5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E

5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E
5|$|Eight Annex2 {{states have}} not {{ratified}} the treaty: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the United States have already signed the Treaty, whereas India, North Korea and Pakistan have not signed it.

5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> H.D.

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first was about <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity}} to design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
