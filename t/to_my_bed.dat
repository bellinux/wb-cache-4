In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just got <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> from the IV [...] and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg {{received}} a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of [...] "Howl" [...] he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, [...] "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window – I have the key – Get married Allen don't take drugs – the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window". In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, [...] "God's informers come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key {{on the side of the}} window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window." [...] These letters and the absence of a facility to recite kaddish inspired Ginsberg to write [...] "Kaddish" [...] which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines [...] "the key is in the light" [...] and [...] "the key is in the window".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Because,' said Barnaby, looking wistfully at her, 'he {{talked to}} me about gold, which is a rare thing, and say what you will, a thing you would like to have, I know. And because he came and went away so strangely--just as white-headed old men come {{sometimes}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed's</b> foot in the night, and say what I can't remember when the bright day returns. He told me he'd come back. I wonder why he broke his word!' ...|$|R
60|$|Hack. She has {{violated}} the law of nations; for yesterday she inveigled my own natural cully from me, a married lord, and made him false <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> father.|$|E
6000|$|Once I tried my {{scheme in}} a large medical way. I had been {{confined}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> several days with lumbago. My case refused to improve. Finally the doctor said,-- ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{last the}} bonne came <b>to</b> make <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> for the night. She {{prepared}} to wrap me {{in a blanket}} and place me in the little chintz chair; but, declining these attentions, I proceeded to dress myself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then he {{had better}} be summoned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sick <b>bed</b> here to-morrow. I may be so ill {{that he will have}} to call twice. That will keep up the belief that I am here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "for if {{my father}} and my mother knew that I did such a thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> alone in the dark." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{instantly}} summoned help. The women-servants {{carried her}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> While they were restoring her to herself, I wrote {{a few lines}} telling the miserable woman how I had discovered her secret.|$|E
6000|$|... "Black Prince. He loves me," [...] {{said the}} lady. [...] "He always comes <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> {{in the morning}} and wakes me by patting my face with his paw. He doesn't mind my being ugly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be quiet, you ass!... Squattez-vous on the floor, then!... I swear you aren't going <b>to</b> sit on <b>my</b> <b>bed!...</b> Mind the tooth-glass," [...] etc.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] replied Redfield; [...] "but all {{the same}} we want you where we can get at you, and where medical aid of the right sort is accessible. I'm going <b>to</b> fetch <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> over here and put you into it. You need rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good," [...] exclaimed Bridge. [...] "I wonder what's keeping James. He {{should have}} been here long since <b>to</b> turn down <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> and fix <b>my</b> bath." ...|$|R
60|$|As for me, {{when they}} were gone I crept away, dazed and bewildered enough, and went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> having seen and heard more than I had a mind for, as disobedient people and eavesdroppers ever do.|$|E
60|$|Weary as I {{was after}} the journey, this miserable news kept me waking long after I had gone <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> The next morning, I was up with the servants--impatient to start for London, by the first train.|$|E
6000|$|... "I lauch at it noo, but I tell ye I used to tak {{my heart}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> in my mooth. If ye hinna {{heard the story}} I dinna think ye 'll be able to guess what the ghost cradle was." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{brain was}} in such a state that for the moment I took no meaning from this introduction. I was {{conscious}} only of indignation against him for sending for me, when for all he knew I might have been unable <b>to</b> leave <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> Suddenly I jumped from the chair.|$|R
6000|$|Those {{last words}} decided me. I {{had had a}} weary time of it since the morning; but (for me) the day was not at an end yet. I said to myself, [...] "I will have it out with Mr. Nugent Dubourg, before I go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> to-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is {{the good}} of working like this if I never am a penny the richer at the end? I shall go to the forest no more! And perhaps, if I take <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and do not run after Fortune, one day she may come to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|The evening {{has come}} and gone. No {{extraordinary}} event has happened. But I have noticed certain peculiarities {{in the conduct of}} Sir Percival and the Count, which have sent me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> feeling very anxious and uneasy about Anne Catherick, and about the results which to-morrow may produce.|$|E
60|$|Two {{or three}} days, perhaps more, perhaps less, had been spent in bed, where I was {{carefully}} attended, and treated, I believe, {{with as much}} judgement as the case required, and I was at length allowed <b>to</b> quit <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> though not the chamber. I was now more able to make some observation on the place of my confinement.|$|R
6000|$|A spirit came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sad <b>bed,</b> And weary {{sad that}} night was I, Who'd tottered, since the dawn was red, Through miles of Grosvenor Gallery, Yea, leagues of long Academy Awaited me when morn grew white, 'Twas then the Spirit whispered nigh, [...] "Take up the pen, my friend, and write! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was alone}} in the house, {{concealed}} now even from Mr Bowater's frigid stare. Yet at sight of these flowers a slight vertigo came over me, and I had <b>to</b> sit on <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> for a moment to recover myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{shame to}} yourself," [...] said I. [...] "This is bairnly conduct. I {{might have been}} snivelling myself, if I had cared to swill my belly with wine.

6000|$|... "I am {{at a small}} inn, {{near the}} Terminal Hotel. I ate my dinner last night {{surrounded}} by English people. With brain still pulsing with {{the motion of the}} sea, I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> rejoicing to feel around me the solid stone walls of this small but ancient hotel." ...|$|E
60|$|I took <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> in the two-roomed {{thatched}} hut where I {{had been}} comfortably established, and sent for {{a gallon of}} rum. That was not for myself. Drunk, Stamford was the best doctor between the Andes and the Pacific. He came, sat at my bedside, and drank himself into condition.|$|E
60|$|I reached home {{very late}} and very sick. That {{was my first}} dissipation, and, as a lesson, it has been of more {{practical}} use to me than all the good books and sermons {{in the world could}} have been. I can remember to this day {{standing in the middle of}} the room in <b>my</b> night-shirt, trying <b>to</b> catch <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> as it came round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{shake hands}} on it--and go <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>my</b> dear chap. You are just {{recovering}} from influenza, and look paler than I like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; if you {{can sleep}} on the floor here, I will take this poor dear <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>bed</b> directly,' said Noemi.
