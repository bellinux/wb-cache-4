5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> advantage that flat mirrors {{can be used}} which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular version of <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> Empress {{waiting until the}} Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view.

5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E
5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E
5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> implication {{that there is one}} or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee the existence of such representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which a realization of the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.|$|E

5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> side effect of making them smarter and deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged.

5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used {{to stand on the}} site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> inscription ' Dorcestriensis Sig : Maioris'.|$|E

5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
