40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} biophysical model that {{explains}} the sizes of radiation-induced hprt deletions. METHODS: Key assumptions: (1) Deletions are produced by two DSB that are closer than an interaction distance {{at the time of}} DSB induction; (2) Interphase chromatin is modelled by a biphasic random walk distribution; and (3) Misrejoining of DSB from two separate tracks dominates at low-LET and misrejoining of DSB from a single track dominates at high-LET. RESULTS: The size spectra for radiation-induced <b>total</b> <b>deletions</b> of the hprt gene are calculated. Comparing with the results of Yamada and coworkers for gamma-irradiated human fibroblasts the study finds that an interaction distance of 0. 75 microm will fit both the absolute frequency and the size spectrum of the <b>total</b> <b>deletions.</b> It is also shown that high-LET radiations produce, relatively, more <b>total</b> <b>deletions</b> of sizes below 0. 5 Mb. The model predicts an essential gene to be located between 2 and 3 Mb from the hprt locus towards the centromere. Using the same assumptions and parameters as for evaluating mutation frequencies, a frequency of intra-arm chromosome deletions is calculated that is in agreement with experimental data. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced total-deletion mutations of the human hprt gene and intrachange chromosome aberrations share a common mechanism for their induction...|$|R

A transgene with 26 A’s transfected into HCT 116 shortened an average of 3. 8 bases pairs after 469 days in culture, less than average deletions of BAT 25 (− 5. 3) or BAT 26 (− 9. 0) in MSI+ cancers. These findings further suggest that extensive polyA deletions common in MSI+ tumors likely reflect multiple stepwise smaller deletions that accumulate more than hundreds of divisions after loss of MMR...|$|R

A total of 39 - 63 % of gamma-ray-induced and 31 - 57 % of alpha-particle-induced mutants had partial or <b>total</b> <b>deletions</b> of the HPRT gene. The proportion of these deletion events was dependent on radiation dose, and at the resolution limits employed {{there were no significant}} differences between the spectra induced by equitoxic doses of alpha particles (0. 2 - 0. 4 Gy) and gamma rays (3 Gy). The molecular nature of the deletions was analyzed by the use of sequence tagged site (STS) primers and PCR amplification as a "probe" for specific regions of the human X chromosome within the Xq 26 region. These STSs were closely linked and spanned regions approximately 1. 7 Mbp from the telomeric side and 1. 7 Mbp from the centromeric side of the HPRT gene.

The radiosensitive xrs- 5 cells are defective in DNA double-strand break rejoining ability and in V(D) J recombination, which can be complemented by Ku protein. Of the 71 spontaneous CHO-K 1 hprt mutants analyzed, 78 % showed no change in exon number or size, 20 % showed loss of one to eight exons (partial deletion), and 3 % showed loss of all nine hprt exons (<b>total</b> <b>deletion).</b> Exposure of CHO-K 1 cells to 6 Gy of gamma rays, which reduced survival levels to 10 %, produced a high deletion spectrum with 45 % of the 20 mutants analyzed showing a loss of one to eight exons and 30 % showing <b>total</b> <b>deletion.</b> Exposure to an equitoxic dose of alpha radiation from 212 Bi, a 220 Rn daughter, resulted in a spectrum similar to the gamma-ray spectrum in that 75 % of the 49 mutants analyzed were deletions.

Of the 92 spontaneous xrs- 5 mutants analyzed for deletions, 43 % showed a loss of one to eight exons and 14 % showed <b>total</b> <b>deletion.</b> This suggests that, in certain regions of the hprt gene, base alterations can be converted into large deletions and alteration in the Ku protein complex can influence this type of mutational process.

40|$|Abstract Background Germ-line {{mutations}} in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes are major contributors to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. Large rearrangements are less frequent in the BRCA 2 gene than in BRCA 1. We report, here, the first <b>total</b> <b>deletion</b> of exon 3 in the BRCA 2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast/ovarian cancer families for BRCA 2 large rearrangements. Deletion of exon 3, {{which is in}} phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels of alternative transcripts lacking exon 3 (Δ 3 delta 3 transcript) {{have been reported in}} normal tissues, which raises the question whether deletion of exon 3 is pathogenic. Methods Large BRCA 2 rearrangements were analysed by QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments) or MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification). The exon 3 deletion was characterized with a "zoom-in" dedicated CGH array to the BRCA 2 gene and sequencing. To determine the effect of exon 3 deletion and assess its pathogenic effect, three methods of transcript quantification were used: fragment analysis of FAM-labelled PCR products, specific allelic expression using an intron 2 polymorphism and competitive quantitative RT-PCR. Results Large rearrangements of BRCA 2 were detected in six index cases out of 2058 tested (3 % of all deleterious BRCA 2 mutations). This study reports the first large rearrangement of the BRCA 2 gene that includes all of exon 3 and leads to an in frame deletion of exon 3 at the transcriptional level. Thirty five variants in exon 3 and junction regions of BRCA 2 are also reported, that contribute to the interpretation of the pathogenicity of the deletion. The quantitative approaches showed that there are three classes of delta 3 BRCA 2 transcripts (low, moderate and exclusive). Exclusive expression of the delta 3 transcript by the mutant allele and segregation data provide evidence for a causal effect of the exon 3 deletion. Conclusion This paper highlights that large rearrangements and <b>total</b> <b>deletion</b> of exon 3 in the BRCA 2 gene could contribute to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that, to interpret the pathogenic effect of any variants of exon 3, both accurate transcript quantification and co-segregation analysis are required. </p...|$|E

Data on the mutation frequency of the two cell lines at low dose-rate were obtained to supplement previously published data at high dose-rate.

Virtually all strains {{have a copy of}} vacA, but its genotype varies. The cag PAI is a region of 32 genes in which the insertion of IS 605 elements in its middle region has been associated with partial or <b>total</b> <b>deletions</b> of it that have generated strains with varying virulence. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to determine the cag PAI integrity, vacA genotype and IS 605 status in groups of isolates from Mexican patients with non-peptic ulcers (NPU), non-bleeding peptic ulcers (NBPU), and bleeding peptic ulcers (BPU). Methods: The cag PAI integrity was performed by detection of eleven targeted genes along this locus using dot blot hybridization and PCR assays. The vacA allelic, cag PAI genotype 1 and IS 605 status were determined by PCR analysis. Results: Groups of 16 - 17 isolates (n = 50) from two patients with NPU, NBPU, and BPU, respectively, were studied. 90 % (45 / 50) of the isolates harbored a complete cag PAI. Three BPU isolates lacked the cag PAI, and two of the NBPU had an incomplete cag PAI: the first isolate was negative for three of its genes, including deletion of the cagA gene, whereas the second did not have the cagM gene. Most of the strains (76 %) had the vacA s 1 b/m...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), {{the most}} common tumor-predisposing {{disorder}} in humans, is caused by defects in the NF 1 tumor-suppressor gene. Comprehensive mutation analysis applying RNA-based techniques complemented with FISH analysis achieves mutation detection rates of approximately 95 % in NF 1 patients. The majority of mutations are minor lesions, and approximately 5 % are <b>total</b> gene <b>deletions.</b> We found 13 single- and/or multiexon deletions/duplications out of 1, 050 detected mutations using our RNA-based approach in a cohort of 1, 100 NF 1 patients and confirmed these changes using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). With MLPA, we found another 12 novel multiexon deletion/duplications in 55 NF 1 patients for whom analysis with multiple assays had not revealed a NF 1 mutation, including 50 previously analyzed comprehensively. The extent of the 22 deletions and 3 duplications varied greatly, {{and there was no}} clustering of breakpoints. We also evaluated the sensitivity of MLPA in identifying deletions in a mosaic state. Furthermore, we tested whether the MLPA P 122 NF 1 area assay could distinguish between type I deletions, with breakpoints in low-copy repeats (NF 1 -LCRs), and type II deletions, caused by aberrant recombination between the JJAZ gene and its pseudogene. Our study showed that intragenic deletions and/or duplications represent only approximately 2 % of all NF 1 mutations. Although MLPA did not substantially increase the mutation detection rate in NF 1 patients, it was a useful first step in a comprehensive mutation analysis scheme to quickly pinpoint patients with single- or multiexon deletions/duplications as well as patients with a <b>total</b> gene <b>deletion</b> who will not need full sequencing of the complete coding region. status: publishe...|$|R
