40|$|Abstract The {{fatigue failure}} of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub {{is one of}} {{important}} failure modes of turbocharger for vehicle application. Because the operating state of turbocharger in the life cycle changes as the work condition of diesel engine changes, the <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub of <b>turbocharger</b> is applied by the variable stress which can causes the fatigue failure. In this paper, the effect of centrifugal load, thermal load and aerodynamic load on the stress of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub is studied, and then the fatigue stress spectrum of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub is developed based on the endurance test profile of vehicle engine. In order to research the fatigue strength of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub, the fatigue specimen is designed {{and the relationship between}} the stress and fatigue life of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub is built. Then, utilizing the linear Miner cumulative damage rule and the first-order reliability method, the reliability model of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub with fatigue failure mode is derived, and the rule that the reliability of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub changes with life is studied. Based on the reliability model of <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> rub with fatigue failure mode developed, the method for determining the reliable fatigue life of <b>compressor</b> rub of <b>turbocharger</b> is proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Centrifugal {{compressors}} of turbochargers {{operate in}} a wide range of rotational speeds, which depends on the load of the supercharged engine. Current designs of <b>turbocharger</b> <b>compressors</b> exhibit high efficiencies accompanied by high flow capacities. Consequences of aerodynamic optimization are high mean stress values in the blades due to centrifugal loading as well as dynamic stresses due to blade vibrations. Blade vibrations in a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>compressor</b> are assumed to be predominantly excited by unsteady aerodynamic forces. These forces are caused by a variety of sources influencing the flow. Examples include the geometry of the flow channel, elbows, the diffuser vanes or struts. Therefore, an understanding of FSI is essential for further design optimizations...|$|R

40|$|When {{people talk}} about race cars or {{high-performance}} sports cars, the topic of turbochargers usually comes up. Turbochargers also appear on large diesel engines. A turbo can significantly boost an engine's horsepower without significantly increasing its weight, which is the huge benefit that makes turbos so popular. Turbochargers are a type of forced induction system. They compress the air flowing into the engine. The advantage of compressing the air is that it lets the engine squeeze more air into a cylinder, and more air means that more fuel can be added. Therefore, you get more power from each explosion in each cylinder. Here in this project we are designing the <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> by using Pro-E and doing analysis by using FEA package.

40|$|Downsizing with {{turbocharging}} is {{the most}} promising way, {{especially in terms of}} cost, to get reduced fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions particularly in the case of Spark Ignition engines. In automotive applications the turbocharger turbine usually operates under heavy unsteady flow conditions due to the opening and closing of engine valves. However, in the case of extremely downsized engines with a reduced number of cylinders and a small intake circuit volume also the compressor performance can be affected by the unsteady flow generated by the engine intake valves. To make simulation models able to accurately predict engine performance, a better understanding of compressor and turbine pulsating flow performance can be accomplished through measurements performed on specialized test facilities, using suitable measuring equipment.

30|$|Due to {{operational}} {{wear and}} uneven carbon absorption in <b>compressor</b> and turbine <b>wheels,</b> the unbalance (me) vibration is induced and {{could lead to}} sub-synchronous vibration accidents for high-speed turbocharger (TC). There are very few research works {{that focus on the}} magnitude effects on such induced unbalance vibration. In this paper, a finite element model (FEM) is developed to characterize a realistic automotive TC rotor with floating ring bearings (FRBs). The nonlinear dynamic responses of the TC rotor system with different levels of induced unbalance magnitude in <b>compressor</b> and turbine <b>wheels</b> are calculated. From the results of waterfall and response spectral intensity plots, the bifurcation and instability phenomena depend on unbalance magnitude during the startup of TC. The sub-synchronous component 0.12 × caused rotor unstable is the dominant frequency for small induced unbalance. The nonlinear effects of induced unbalance in the turbine wheel is obvious stronger than the <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel.</b> As the unbalance magnitude increases from 0.05  g·mm to 0.2  g·mm, the vibration component changes from mainly 0.12 × to synchronous vibration 1 ×. When unbalance increases continuously, the rotor vibration response amplitude is rapidly growing and the 1 × caused by the large unbalance excitation becomes the dominant frequency. A suitable un-balance magnitude of turbine <b>wheel</b> and <b>compressor</b> <b>wheel</b> for the high-speed TC rotor with FRBs is proposed: the value of induced un-balance magnitude should be kept around 0.2  g·mm.|$|R

40|$|Deficient {{performances}} of <b>turbocharger</b> <b>compressors</b> inside turbo-charged engines limit the behaviour {{of the drive}} train. This problem has shifted the design space for compressors towards their performance at part-speed and low-flow conditions. The most dominant feature of these flow conditions is inlet recirculation. It causes {{a large portion of}} flow to be expelled through the rotor inlet, creating a blockage ring on the casing. While on the one hand, inlet recirculation is the main loss-source at low-speed and low-flow within centrifugal compressors, on the other hand, it also keeps the compressors functioning because it reduces incidence. This thesis aimed towards increasing the understanding of inlet recirculation, with the scope on improving the part-speed, low-flow performance of automotive <b>turbocharger</b> <b>compressors.</b> The phenomenon was investigated regarding its key features, the conditions at which it occurs and its impact on performance. Furthermore, a reduced order model was derived and the influence of the tip gap size as a design parameter was analysed. The research was carried out on an automotive <b>turbocharger</b> <b>compressor</b> which was investigated experimentally and numerically. Inlet recirculation is a phenomenon which takes place in the tip region of the rotor, extending far downstream and far upstream of the leading edge. The flow within the recirculation bubble features a strong positive swirl component, affecting the work input into the machine. The phenomenon is non-periodic in a time-averaged sense. An investigation of the rotor flow-field regarding inlet recirculation, carried out for the first time, revealed that the starting point of inlet recirculation is located far inside the rotor passage. An analysis based on mass, momentum and energy allowed the derivation of a low-order model to account for inlet recirculation in preliminary design. In the compressor map, inlet recirculation was present over 40 % of the map width at low speeds. It maintained its presence with increasing rotor speed beyond the point where the inlet flow became transonic. The losses in the inlet recirculation zone were shown to be up to 35 % of the total compressor loss at low speed. A loss analysis showed that inlet recirculation was the main loss source at low-flow conditions. The tip clearance study showed that the size and intensity of inlet recirculation was independent of the tip gap size. Efficiency gains due to reduced tip leakage were marginalised by the presence of inlet recirculation but the rotor maintained enhanced pressure rise capabilities for reduced tip gap sizes...|$|R

While the ported shroud design delays surge, it comes with a small penalty in efficiency. This work presents an investigation of the flow processes associated with a ported shroud compressor and quantifies the effect of these flow mechanisms on the compressor operation. The full compressor stage is numerically modelled using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach employing the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model for steady state simulations at the design and near surge conditions. The wheel rotation is modelled using a multiple reference frame (MRF) approach. The results show that the flow exits the PS cavity at the near surge condition in the form of three jet-like structures of varying velocity amplitudes. Net entropy generation in the compressor model is used to assess the influence of the ported shroud design on the compressor losses, and the results indicate a small Inlet-PS mixing region is the primary source of entropy generation in the near surge conditions. The analysis also explores the trends of entropy generation at the design and the near surge condition across the different speed lines. The results show that the primary source of entropy generation is the impeller region for the design condition and the inlet-PS cavity region for the near surge condition...|$|R
