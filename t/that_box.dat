Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in <b>that</b> <b>box</b> set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E
25|$|One {{point is}} scored for each pin that is knocked over. So, in a {{hypothetical}} game, if player A felled 3 pins {{with their first}} ball, then 5 with their second, and 1 with the third, they would receive a total of 9 points for <b>that</b> <b>box.</b> If player B knocks down 9 pins with their first shot, but misses with their second and third, they would also score 9.|$|E
25|$|A foul always scores zero (0) pinfall {{for that}} ball's delivery. A player may reset the pins after a foul {{on the first}} or second ball {{provided}} no pins have legally been felled in <b>that</b> <b>box.</b> Therefore, if on the first ball there is a foul or zero, and on the second ball the bowler fouls and knocks down pins, the pins may be reset, allowing the bowler an opportunity to score a ten box on their third ball. Knocking down all ten pins after resetting immediately following a foul in the first ball results in a spare. Fouling on all three attempts scores a zero box.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested <b>that</b> <b>box</b> wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.|$|E

James contacted {{the editor of the}} Echo and the police were allowed to place the messages in the Echo, disguised as Mensa puzzles and made to look like wordsearches.

500|$|... "Empty Orchestra"—the name {{of which}} is a literal {{translation}} of the Japanese word karaoke—was written by Pemberton and Shearsmith, and was directed by Guillem Morales. It was originally intended as a wholly musical episode. The resulting episode, for Pemberton, was [...] "a kind of musical", in that [...] "there's music all the way through it". While he would be interested in doing [...] "a proper La La Land-style musical" [...] in the future, [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] serves to [...] " [...] <b>that</b> <b>box</b> to some degree". The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised [...] "Empty Orchestra", was also [...] "very appealing". Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of Inside No. 9. At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx", Pemberton said that [...] "When you’ve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, you kind of go, well, better try something different!" [...] One influence on the episode was Shane Meadows's This Is England; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the foul line for the bowler themselves, there is a line [...] down the lane from the foul line; this is the lob line, and the ball must first contact the lane at any point on the bowler's side of it, be it on the approach or the first ten feet of the lanebed. Any [...] "airborne" [...] ball delivery not making contact with the approach or lanebed short of the [...] "lob line" [...] constitutes a violation of this rule, and is termed a lob with any pins knocked down by such a ball not counting — and such pins are not reset if the lobbed ball was not the third and last shot for that player in <b>that</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The première of Il Muto {{initially}} goes well, {{until the}} voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged <b>that</b> <b>Box</b> 5 was not kept empty for him. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a [...] "little toad". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and André plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard throughout the auditorium ("Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh").|$|E

2500|$|At {{a casino}} {{blackjack}} table, the dealer faces {{five to seven}} playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight standard 52-card decks are shuffled together. At {{the beginning of each}} round, up to three players can place their bets in the [...] "betting box" [...] at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is {{at the front of the}} betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of <b>that</b> <b>box</b> are said to [...] "play behind". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the first}} ball knocked down {{at least one}} pin, the rack can not be reset because of a {{subsequent}} foul. Those pins felled by a foul ball (a ball rolled into the gutter, a lobbed ball, a ball delivered by a bowler over the foot foul line)—whether standing, playable wood, or pins in the gutter—remain down and reduce {{the maximum number of}} pins to be counted for the box. Therefore, if there are six pins standing after the first ball, a foul on the next ball that manages to knock down the remaining six pins means that the frame is finished, with a score of 4. However, if the foul ball knocked down only some of the six standing pins, a third ball may still be rolled to attempt to knock down the remaining upright pins. In this example, the raw score might appear to be [...] "4 4 2 = X", but after adjusting for the foul second ball, the true score is [...] "4 F 2 = 6". Similar logic holds when rolling two good balls and fouling in the third attempt: the frame is over and only the pins felled in the first two attempts are recorded for the score for <b>that</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

40|$|Common sense, Bernard Suits, and David Best {{would agree}} <b>that</b> <b>boxing</b> is a purposive (i. e., non- aesthetic) sport. We argue, on the contrary, <b>that</b> <b>boxing</b> {{is in fact}} purposive only in some {{contexts}} (i. e., knockout) and an aesthetic sport in others (i. e., decision by judges). This is because boxing judges are empowered to give more points to a fighter {{not just for the}} quantity but the quality of strikes and of their performance in the ring in general. In other words, in bouts whose outcomes are decided by judges, a boxer’s purpose is not just to land punches, as the manner in which blows are struck (cleanly, with better ring control, etc.) —that is, how a boxer performs—figures into the awarding of points and consequent determination of outcome. This is the very hallmark of aesthetic sports. Boxing should therefore be classified instead as a “purposive/aesthetic” sport: a hybrid category that undermines a pure dichotomy between purposive and aesthetic sports...|$|R
