The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of the eco-costs of all midpoints.The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive Best Available Technology which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of <b>Tradable</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Rights</b> which is required in future. Example: For reduction of CO2 emissions to a sustainable level, the marginal prevention costs are the costs of replacement of coal-fired power plants by windmill parks at the sea.|$|E

At the same time, traditional economics is being challenged both empirically and theoretically by scholars in different fields. Its non-neutrality in dealing with climate-related issues-which is illustrated by the controversy over the "no-regret potential"-would thus call for an opening of economics to insights from other disciplines. Within that context, we show that an evolutionary-inspired line of thought coupled with a systemic and historical perspective of technological change provides a very insightful alternative to traditional economics. More particularly, it follows from that framework that the picture of the climate challenge ahead looks very different from what traditional economic analyses would suggest.

40|$|This {{contribution}} discusses inspection {{with regard}} to emissions trading. It focuses on the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. The core rule of emissions trading is that industries need to cover their emissions with <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights.</b> There are several options {{for the government to}} distribute those rights, basically through a free allocation or an auction. The need to cover emissions with a tradable right gives a financial incentive to firms to choose for the reduction of emissions, of course related to the market price of the tradable right. This price-incentive at the same time urges governments to put in place a sound enforcement approach. One of the characteristics of current emissions trading schemes is that they heavily rely on self-monitoring duties. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility to inspect rests on the government. However, with the introduction of emissions trading a remarkable shift takes place: instead of the more traditional control of the actual behaviour of industries, inspection by the government ranges under the greenhouse gas emissions-trading instrument much more towards the control of self-monitoring activities. The use of verifiers within the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme is in this respect a unique new provision, {{but at the same time}} raises many practical and fundamental questions...|$|E
40|$|There is a some {{consensus}} among economists, environmentalists, and politicians that {{some form of}} “cap and trade’ program is the appropriate regulatory mechanism to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions necessary to avoid disastrous global climate disruptions. “Cap and trade” programs necessarily incorporate <b>tradable</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>rights</b> – essentially <b>tradable</b> rights to pollute. As such, they run into principled objection by some environmentalists who oppose the notion of creating economic rights in the global commons – essentially the “right to pollute. ” This principled objection derives doctrinal support from the public trust doctrine – the ancient notion rooted in common law and Roman law that certain public resources such as flowing water, shorelands, and the air are not susceptible of private ownership, but are instead held by the sovereign “in trust” {{for the benefit of the}} public. This article will consider practical and principled arguments for and against emissions trading as a global warming solution as well as the application of public trust principles to greenhouse gas cap and trade. I conclude that, at least under the mature version of the public trust doctrine that prevails in U. S. law, a cap and trade system is not irreconcilable with a cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions control program, but that the legacy interests underlying public trust doctrine preclude cap-and-trade programs that exceed sustainable levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Under this approach, all cap-and-trade systems for regulating greenhouse gas emissions proposed to date would exceed public trust limits based on sustainability (including the First Implementation Period of the Kyoto Protocol) ...|$|R
40|$|Grandfathering is {{currently}} the main principle for the initial allocation of <b>tradable</b> CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> under the European cap-and-trade scheme. Furthermore, political feasibility often requires non-restrictive emission caps. Grandfathering under lax cap is unjust, biased and brings polluters unintended windfall profits. Still, in any post-Kyoto international CO 2 regime, lax caps may be critical in coaxing binding emission targets out of more countries, {{especially those in the}} less-developed world. This paper argues that there is a certain quantity of <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> between the initial and the optimal emissions, the grandfathering of which brings polluters zero windfall profits or zero windfall losses. Our theoretical concept of zero-windfall grandfathering can be used to demonstrate the windfall profits that have emerged at company level during the first EU trading period.

40|$|The Coase Theorem, so {{coined by}} George Stigler in 1966, based on Ronald H. Coase's oft-quoted 1960 article, “The Problem of Social Cost” {{has led to}} many {{different}} scholarly debates throughout the years. Its importance and validity has been argued, but it cannot be denied {{that it was a}} seminal article {{in the creation of the}} field of law and economics, as well as being one of the most quoted articles in economics. The Coase Theorem says, in brief, that allocation of resources will be Pareto-optimal no matter what the initial distribution of property rights, assuming no transaction costs (Fisher, 1981, Kolstad, 2000). Stigler (1966) himself stated it thus: “… under perfect competition private and social costs will be equal. ” (p. 113). Today, this theorem is one of the essential ideas taught in environmental economics textbooks. There are many scholars debating the validity of the Coase Theorem, and although I find it fascinating how many different things people have taken out of this theorem and this article, I do not participate in this debate directly. Rather, I look at the Coase Theorem in regards to the idea of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights.</b> Specifically, I look at the scholarly process in the development of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights,</b> and my research question is: Did Coase's 1960 article “The Problem of Social Cost”, and the subsequent Coase Theorem lead to the development of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights?</b> This thesis, then, has a definitive historical perspective, specifically within the branch of the history of economic thought. It also pays attention to scholarly processes in the field of economics since 1960. I first emphasize Coase's contribution to the field of environmental economics, before I focus my concentration on the development of tradable emissions rights, while tying Coase into this discussion. My research question can of course be answered by a hearty but subjective 'yes!' The basis for this answer would be that Dales, when he wrote Pollution, property & prices was very inspired by Coase's article. I track this path from “The Problem of Social Cost” to today's idea of tradable permits. This includes some of the debates in the 1960 s and 70 s, as well as some comparisons between some noteworthy economists such as Coase, Mishan, and Dales. I also include some mention of what Montgomery, Tietenberg, Hahn and Stavins got out of Dales' ideas. I have chosen Montgomery because he is so often cited for his 1972 article, Tietenberg because he has written the authoritative textbook on the subject of emissions trading, and Hahn and Stavins because they have both written many articles over the last few decades that have to do with emissions permits. Lastly I consider some of Adam Rose's work, as he claims the Coase Theorem as the precursor to the idea of marketable permits. In an attempt to find and analyze the scholarly path from Coase's 1960 article “The Problem of Social Cost” to the idea of tradable permits, I analyze a series of works and their connection to each other. This thesis can thus be seen as a non-traditional literature review, in that I survey the literature in the field on this topic, but only along this path that I have designated. I show that the ideas contained in Dales' essay Pollution property & prices are reminiscent of and can be said to be taken from Coase's article. I discuss why Dales' essay should be seen as the tipping point work, the work that made the idea of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights</b> seem like a viable option. After that, I acknowledge and discuss the importance of Montgomery's 1972 article “Markets in licenses and efficient pollution control programs”, and I show how it is cited consistently as the work that rigorously proved the efficiency of marketable permits. I further look at some prominent scholars within the field, to see where they align with Coase's, Dales' and Montgomery's work, and to see how they have moved the idea of tradable permits forward. This idea of marketable permits seems to have gone full-circle, beginning with Dales as a product of Political Economy, jumping through the hoops to prove itself as a worthy economic concept with Montgomery's highly theoretical, rigorous proof of its least-cost efficiency, and finally ending up again among the policy-minded and political economists of Hahn's and Stavin's caliber. How scholars build on each other's work is worthy of investigation. The wealth of information and research available to us is simply staggering, and to be able to not lose track of it all is a valuable exercise. The field of economics seems to be in need of more retrospection, and it is thus valuable to take a meta-view of the mass of research work available. If we as scholars are all building on each others' work, what happens when we're building inaccurately, or at least not as the scholar you just quoted intended? In the case of Coase, it seems he has been misquoted through his whole career, but nevertheless, good research has come out of it. This thesis also highlights the difference between theory and practice, and how crucial it is to distinguish between the two. The theory of marketable permits is only important insofar as it can be successfully implemented. As a theory it only has validity as an academic exercise. Many authors investigated in this thesis have wrestled with the difference between theory and practice (notably, Hahn and Stavins), and through their work, we can see that one should be careful to assume that what works in theory will work in practice. Thus, bridging the gap between theory and practice is important. Dales' opinion that “…lawyers, economists, and students of public administration [...] . ” should work together to solve this issue (1968 a, p. 105), is as true today as it was in 1968, and the increased cooperation and work within cross sections of these and the fields of natural science is the evidence that, at least in academia, interdisciplinarity is becoming widespread...|$|E

Combining both programmes (offset credits and emission allowances) is particularly attractive because all participants, and especially the industrialised country, benefit from it.

Large, stationary emission sources such as utilities and large cement plants will be issued certain quantities of emission rights, but EPA has encouraged states to set aside some proportion of these rights for energy-efficiency and renewable energy (EE/RE) programs, which could sell rights and use the proceeds to further support their programs.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{order to}} reduce the risks of a climate change, a major problem in {{developing}} an effective international policy, is the allocation of the responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions among regions. The report presents two approaches to provide for the allocation problem of emission reductions of the most important greenhouse gas CO 2. The first deals with a description of the emission debt concept. We use an equity rule by which all past and future dwellers on earth are permitted to emit an equal CO 2 quotum per year. Furthermore, the level of the equal emission quotum is dependent on the policy related CO 2 -equivelant concentration targets. The regional emission debt is the amount of CO 2, based on a equal share per capita, emitted in a region in the past exceeding the amount allowed. The resulting initial allocation of emission rights may be used as a start for a concept of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>rights.</b> In the second approach the allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem. This contains an "optimal" trade off between rough estimates for cosial and economic consequences of reducing fossil CO 2 -emissions in order to meet policy targets, as expressed in a CO 2 -equivalent concentration level. The optimization algorithm developed is a first attempt in solving the optimization problem, where restictions are dependent on simulation runs with IMAGE (an Intergrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect). The algorithm is used to find an allocation of regional fossil CO 2 -emissions in order to maximize welfare of future generations, givin a maximum allowable concentration level. Results of both approches indicate that if the world community is to accept constraints on CO-emissions, industrialized regions will have to take the main responsibility in reducing CO 2 -emissions either by reducing emissions in their own regions and in developing regions...|$|E

A key result of our analytical model is that TGCs may be an imprecise instrument for regulating the generation of green electricity. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the combination of TGCs with a system of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permits may yield outcomes contrary to the intended purpose. The results are valid under both autarky and international trade. Renewable energy; electricity; green certificates; emissions trading. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permits may be {{considered}} as a policy instrument that gives incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost efficient way. Due to transaction costs it may not be cost efficient to include sectors in which there are many small emission sources. One example of a sector that could {{be considered}} as made up of many small emission sources is the household or residential sector. If the residential sector is not included in a <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permit system but the power or district-heating sector is included some technologies for residential heating, like heat pumps and district heating are affected since fuel for production of electricity to heat pumps and fuel for district heating are used in the trading sector while the heat is used in the residential sector. In this study, the implications for carbon dioxide emissions from heat pumps in households of a <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permit system where power producers but not households are obligated to have emission permits are discussed. The results indicates that when considering how actors in the emission permit market are affected by measures in the household lead to different conclusions regarding greenhouse gas emissions compared to a system where there is no emissions trading...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} a) a domestic carbon tax policy, and, b) participation in a global <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permits regime on carbon emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and poverty, in India. The results, based a computable general equilibrium model of the Indian economy, show that a carbon tax policy that simply recycles carbon tax revenues to households imposes heavy costs in terms of lower economic growth and higher poverty. However, the fall in GDP and rise in poverty can be minimized or even prevented if the emission restriction target is a very mild one and tax revenues are transferred to the poor. A soft emission reduction target is all that India needs to set for itself, given that even a ten percent annual reduction in aggregate emissions will bring down its per capita emissions to a level far below global per capita emissions. On the other hand, participation in the <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> permits regime opens up an opportunity for India to sell surplus permits. India would {{then be able to}} use the revenues from permits to speed up GDP growth and poverty reduction and keep its per capita emission below the 1990 per capita global emissions level.
