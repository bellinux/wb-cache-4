Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again."

2500|$|On January 17 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Tuscaloosa to defeat Alabama 70 to 48. Kentucky used two big runs {{to take a}} 35 to 17 lead by halftime. Alabama trimmed the lead in half with a 13-4 run {{coming out of the}} locker room, when the Wildcats missed their first five shots. The rally was short-lived, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> worse for the Tide. The Wildcats reclaimed control with 10 straight points en route to a 16-2 run that featured two 3-pointers by Ulis, one by Booker and a powerful dunk by Cauley-Stein. Freshman Devin Booker scored 13 points and remained solid from the perimeter. On January 20 Kentucky defeated Vanderbilt 65 to 57 at Rupp Arena. The Wildcats didn't lead by double digits until early in the second half, and that 45 to 33 advantage lasted briefly as the Commodores began answering from the perimeter to stay within reach. Five combined 3-pointers by Vanderbilt's Riley LaChance (16 points) and Matthew Fisher-Davis (13) helped Vanderbilt pull within 58 to 54 with 2:36 left. The Commodores never got closer as the Harrisons closed it out for the Wildcats. On January 24 Kentucky {{traveled to}} Columbia to defeat South Carolina 58 to 43. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. Ulis started the comeback for Kentucky with a steal and basket before Booker made two fouls shots and a dunk and the Wildcats were on their way. Booker scored seven points in Kentucky's 14 to 0 run that spanned both halves, closing the surge with a 3-pointer that put the Wildcats ahead 37 to 24 with 18:28 remaining. On January 29 the Wildcats again traveled to Columbia, this time to defeat Missouri 69 to 53. The Tigers looked game for most of the first half. Milking the clock with crisp ball movement, Missouri was able to crack Kentucky's long and lean front line for easy baskets. Missouri's Keanau Post started it with a rim-rattling dunk a few minutes in, and a pair of dunks by Ryan Rosburg had the fans in Mizzou Arena on their feet. Another dunk by Jakeenan Gant late in the half allowed the Tigers to close within 32 to 25. The Wildcats struggled some more early in the second half, throwing up a series of ugly jumpers and missing a couple shots at the rim. Missouri struggled to take advantage, but did close within 38 to 32 on Clark's basket with 14:25 to go. Foul trouble began to set in, though, with Missouri's Namon Wright and Montaque Gill-Caesar each picking up their fourth with more than 15 minutes left in the game. The Wildcats, with more quality depth, were able to capitalize on their absences and put together a 10 to 2 run to gain control. The Harrison twins led the way. Aaron knocked down a jumper, and after Andrew did the same, he proceeded to the foul line on the next four trips down the floor. Wright fouled out with 8:52 to go. Gill-Caesar joined him less than a minute later. And by the time the Wildcats had hit those free throws, their lead had swelled to 56 to 36. On January 30 Kentucky faced off against Alabama for the second time this season at Rupp Arena, defeating the Crimson Tide 70 to 55. Towns scored all 12 of his points in the first half to put Kentucky ahead. Cauley-Stein snapped out of a mini-slump with 12 points and four rebounds, Booker added 11 points with three 3-pointers and Aaron Harrison had 10. Kentucky quickly rolled to a double-digit lead and positioned itself to blow out Alabama before settling for a 37 to 24 advantage at the break. Kentucky controlled the paint 28 to 14 while their bench dominated the Tide 31 to 8. Kentucky also committed just five turnovers while forcing Alabama into 13 mistakes that resulted in 20 points.|$|E
