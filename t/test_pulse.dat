40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} on Myxicola giant axons {{to determine if the}} sodium activation and inactivation processes are coupled or independent. The main experimental approach was {{to examine the effects of}} changing <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> on steady-state inactivation curves. Arguments were presented to show that in the presence of a residual uncompensated series resistance the interpretation of the results depends critically on the manner of conducting the experiment. Analytical and numerical calculations were presented to show that as long as <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> are confined to an approximately linear negative conductance region of the sodium current-voltage characteristic, unambiguous interpretations can be made. When examined in the manner of Hodgkin and Huxley, inactivation in Myxicola is quantitatively similar to that described by the h variable in squid axons. However, when <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> were increased along the linear negative region of the sodium current-voltage characteristic, steady-state inactivation curves translate to the right along the voltage axis. The shift in the inactivation curve is a linear function of the ratio of the sodium conductance of the <b>test</b> <b>pulses,</b> showing a 5. 8 my shift for a twofold increase in conductance.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the problem of {{estimating}} the initial rotor position in permanent-magnet sensorless drives can benefit from {{the availability of a}} direct measurement of motor phase voltages.

Since the application of irregular <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> may increase the estimation uncertainties, the available voltage measurement is exploited to implement a closed-loop amplitude control of the <b>test</b> <b>pulses.</b> The second method is introduced both to overcome an issue related to the digital measurement approach adopted in this paper and to allow position estimation even in a motor with no relevant saliency, a case for which the first method is inappropriate.

Mechanical threshold was determined with a 2 -ms <b>test</b> <b>pulse.</b> The immediate effect of depolarization was inhibition of the mechanical system. The consequent increase in the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold was linearly related {{to the size of}} the depolarization and there was, on the average, a 10 % increase in threshold for a 10 -mV depolarization in mammalian fibers. The duration of the inhibitory period was also related {{to the size of the}} depolarization. Inhibition was interrupted by the onset of activation (seen as a reduction in the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold), and in rat soleus fibers this occurred within 100 ms with a 20 -mV depolarization, inhibition decayed within 10 ms. The decay of activation after brief conditioning pulses was initially rapid (on the average, the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold recovered to 80 % of its control value within 1 ms) and then slow (full recovery took 100 - 500 ms). After long conditioning pulses, activation often decayed into a period of inhibition. When depolarization (of 20 mV or more) was maintained for several seconds, the fibers became inactivated.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} two methods to measure Ca 2 + channel inactivation in Lymnaea neurons—one method, {{based upon the}} conventional double-pulse protocol, uses currents during a moderately large depolarizing pulse, and the other uses tail currents after a very strong activating pulse. Both methods avoid contamination by proton currents and are unaffected by rundown of Ca 2 + current. The magnitude of inactivation measured differs for the two methods; this difference arises because the measurement of inactivation is inherently dependent upon the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> voltage used to monitor the Ca 2 + channel conductance. We discuss two models that can generate such <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence of inactivation measurements—a two-channel model and a two-open-state model. The first model accounts for this by assuming the existence of two types of Ca 2 + channels, different proportions of which are activated by the different test pulses. The second model assumes only one Ca 2 + channel type, with two closed and open states; in this model, the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence {{is due to the}} differential activation of channels in the two closed states by the test pulses. <b>Test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence of inactivation measurements of Ca 2 + channels may be a general phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies...|$|E

The macroscopic SR calcium release waveform, obtained from the spark latency histogram and the estimated open time of the channel or channels underlying a spark, exhibits an early peak and rapid marked decline during large depolarizations.

However, the mean use time and mean amplitude of the individual sparks are quite similar at all test depolarizations and at all times during a given depolarization, indicating that the channel open times and conductances underlying sparks are essentially independent of voltage.

This {{study focused on}} the effects of a presynaptic calcium-activated potassium conductance, gK~c~, on the transmitter release evoked by single and paired depolarizing current pulses. Blocking gK~c~) by adding tetraethylammonium ion (TEA; 5 - 20 mM) to a solution containing tetrodotoxin and aminopyridines caused the relation between presynaptic potential and transmitter release to steepen and shift to less depolarized potentials. When two depolarizing current pulses were applied at 20 -ms intervals with g~c ~ not blocked, the presynaptic voltage change to the second (<b>test)</b> <b>pulse</b> was inversely related to the amplitude of the first (conditioning) pulse.

Therefore, studies were conducted to elucidate the role of IKs in normal human ventricular muscle and in preparations in which both repolarization reserve was attenuated and sympathetic activation was increased by exogenous dofetilide and adrenaline. Methods and Results - Preparations were obtained from undiseased organ donors. Action potentials were measured in ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles using conventional microelectrode techniques; membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes using voltage-clamp techniques. Chromanol 293 B (10 mu mol/L), L- 735, 821 (100 nmol/L), and HMR- 1556 (100 nmol/L and 1 mu mol/L) produced a < 12 -ms change in APD while pacing at cycle lengths ranging from 300 to 5000 ms, whereas the I-Kr blockers sotalol and E- 4031 markedly lengthened APD. In voltage-clamp experiments, L- 735, 821 and chromanol 293 B each blocked IKs {{in the presence of}} E- 4031 to block IKr.
