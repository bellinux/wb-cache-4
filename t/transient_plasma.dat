40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} {{experimental study of}} the application and the underlying physics of <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> ignition. <b>Transient</b> <b>plasma</b> generated by nanosecond electrical discharges has demonstrated lean-burn capability and reductions in ignition delay {{in a variety of}} engines, resulting in higher combustion efficiencies and lowered emissions compared to conventional spark ignition. The experiments performed demonstrate the effects of <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> ignition and attempt to understand the basic physics behind it by examining the production of radicals, conditions for ignition, and combustion characteristics.; Critical {{to the study of the}} application of <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> is the enabling technology: pulsed power systems. To realize this technology in aircraft and automobile engines, the size, weight, cost, reliability, and electrical energy consumption of the pulsed power systems must be comparable to that of the current spark ignition systems. To that end, a compact, solid state 12 ns pulse generator was developed and successfully implemented in <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> ignition experiments.; <b>Transient</b> <b>plasma</b> was applied in both quiescent and flowing fuel-air mixtures in a pulse detonation engine (PDE), an internal combustion engine (ICE), and a constant volume reactor. Reduced ignition delays and lean-burn capability were demonstrated. A 12 ns, 70 mJ pulse was used achieve similar gains as those produced by an 85 ns, 800 mJ pulse, which means that more compact pulse generators may be used for this application. It was demonstrated that water inhibits the performance of TPI, and optical diagnostic techniques were used to determine that this was due to a significant decrease in production of atomic oxygen, which plays an important role in enhancing combustion kinetics.; It was demonstrated that after a <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> discharge, ignition kernels are formed at the ends of spatially separated streamer channels, where there is an enhanced reduced electric field (hundreds of Td) and significant energy transferred into electronically excited species. Evidence is presented that <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> ignition occurs in two phases; a distinct non-thermal phase of ignition, wherein the efficient production of electronically excited species accelerates reaction rates, and a subsequent thermal phase, driven by exothermic fuel oxidation in reactions with free radicals and the decay of active species. It is concluded that TPI has the potential to improve combustion efficiency compared to traditional spark ignition for wide-ranging applications to engine technology...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis {{presents}} an experimental study into {{the utility of}} <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> ignition (TPI) of hydrocarbon fuel-air mixtures and the basic physics behind said phenomena. <b>Transient</b> <b>plasma</b> has several advantages over traditional spark ignition, consistently demonstrating reductions in ignition delay and extended lean burn capability. It is postulated that high energy electrons generated during the electrical discharge are responsible for electron impact dissociation, ionization, and fragmentation of molecules in the medium resulting in radical formation that drives the combustion process. The experiments described in this thesis illustrate TPI's effects and attempt to understand the underlying physics by looking at <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> induced production of radicals, ignition, and flame propagation.; Using optical diagnostic techniques {{the ability of a}} <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> to populate a cylindrical discharge volume with the hydroxyl radical (OH) is analyzed during combustion of stoichiometric quiescent CH 4 -air mixtures. Ground state OH production is analyzed using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF). Broadband transitions of OH near 309 and 314 nm were also used to monitor <b>transient</b> <b>plasma</b> production of OH* via optical emission spectroscopy (OES). A high speed camera was used to image ignition and flame propagation in the chamber, providing spatial and temporal resolution over the entire combustion event.; <b>Transient</b> <b>plasma</b> successfully ignited the CH 4 - air mixture, populating the discharge volume with radicals. Mean OH number densities produced by the discharge were found to reach ~ 4 x 10 ^ 14 molecules - cm^(- 3) and decay within 100 µs of the plasma. Ignition under these conditions was found to occur approximately 1 ms after the discharge along the anode, creating a cylindrically expanding flame front. TPI was found to be a truly volumetric ignition source creating multiple ignition kernels whose proximity to the anode is consistent with the region of highest field and thus maximum radical density. Additionally the rapid decay of the initial OH (as seen by the pump beam) with respect to the time of ignition suggests that the anode itself may have an important role in sustaining and enhancing combustion kinetics...|$|E
