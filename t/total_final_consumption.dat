Moreover, the transport sector in Mexico represents 44.7% of the <b>total</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease cost of ownership for the end-consumers.|$|E

40|$|The {{policy of}} energy {{efficiency}} {{at the state}} level is aimed above everything at the effective use of available energy reserves. The information about total volume of their use and supply should {{play a key role in}} taking well-considered management decisions as far as energy efficiency policy is concerned. The importance of solving the problems related to the research on available energy reserves effective use, which requires systematization of academic and methodological approaches to the corresponding statistical provision, defined the choice and specified this research objective and tasks. The subject of the research is academic and practical aspects of statistic research on energy reserves effective use at the national economy level. The research objective is to define the best economic figures of efficient energy reserves use {{at the state level}}. To achieve the research objective the following tasks were defined and completed: 1) to assess the tendencies of national energy industry development and energy reserves use; 2) to carry out a statistic analysis of efficient energy reserves use at the state level. For the completion of the defined tasks such general scientific methods were used as generalization – to determine the theoretic background of energy industry statistics, logical method – for characterization of the energy reserves current condition; statistical techniques – for the integrated assessment of energy reserves effective use at the state level. This research emphasizes the importance of statistical surveys on the energy reserves effective use. The author has come to the conclusion, that natural gas (37. 1 %) occupies the first place in the energy budget structure of Ukraine. The second place in terms of volume is occupied by coal (32. 8 % of the combustibles supply structure in Ukraine). The third place is occupied by nuclear energy (18. 7 %). It was revealed that Ukrainian economy directly depends on the import of energy reserves: in 2011 45. 8 % of all the energy reserves supply was imported, and 62. 4 % of the imported reserves was natural gas. Natural gas portion in the scheme of <b>total</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of energy reserves constituted 38. 5 % – it still remains the main energy reserve used in industry, communal and public service and transport sectors. 16 % is constituted by crude oil and its refinement products, electricity and heat energy. Peat and coal constitute 12. 3 %. It was determined that Ukrainian economy is energy-dependent, since in 2011 35 % of <b>total</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of energy reserves fell to industry sector, which most energy-intensive branches are iron and steel industry and chemical and petrochemical industries. Such economic structure is the reason of overrun of the gross domestic product (GDP) energy consumption if compared to other European countries. The result of the research is the calculation of the national economy energy efficiency (EE) index number within 2000 – 2011 year period. For example in 2011 this index number equaled 3. 604, while in 2000 it was 1. 979. Having calculated in such a way EE index numbers for each year for the period of 2000 – 2011 and having analyzed the change dynamics, the author has come to the conclusion that index number increases at the level of national economy, i. e. year by year the smaller volume of energy reserves is spent on manufacturing of products (work) and provision of services by <b>total</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> (TFC) sector. The carried out analysis gives an opportunity to determine the main directions of final consumption of fuel and energy, volumes of stocks, the level of using energy resources in transformation sector...|$|E

Due to e. g. population growth and higher comfort requirements it is highly likely that this energy consumption will continue to increase. As such, energy efficiency in buildings has become a key goal in any energy policy.

This study seeks the economically most profitable combination of insulation - facade, roof, floor and glazing - taking into account this Flemish EPB- standard. Therefore a scenario-analysis is conducted using the EPB-software Flanders and a self-designed Excel file for calculating the most important profitability criteria. Based on these criteria the most profitable combination is determined for a maximum E-level of 80. Using a reference point for three types of dwellings studied, the scenario-analysis shows that for the half-open dwelling the insulation of roof and floor becomes more important whereas for the open dwelling it is the insulation of facade and roof. Further on we can conclude that the EPB-policy should distinguish between the dwelling types and should take on more stringent values for the U-level. ...|$|E

40|$|Generally speaking, both {{supply and}} use of energy in Iran are {{unsustainable}}. The unsustainable energy supply and use coupled with an unreliable and unsecure energy system have striking and lasing impacts on economic, social and environmental development of Iran. Natural gas and oil have dominated the total production of energy sources (TPES) in Iran for the past 50 years. Natural gas has also dominated the <b>total</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> (TFC) since 1999. Other alternative resources have been playing marginal roles in Iran's development. The high share of fossil fuels in energy supply and use has striking social, economic and environmental consequences. Additionally, Iran's reliance on oil and gas resources makes the energy sector in Iran vulnerable and highly unsecure. In order to address these issues, I provide indicators of energy sustainability and analyze the trends of these indicators systematically. These indicators help policy makers as well as {{public and private sectors}} get a better understanding of major driving forces that affect energy sustainability, economic prosperity as well as social and environmental well-being. Based on these indicators, I explore the impacts of energy subsidies, innovation policies, technological advancement, renewable energy development, US sanctions, international cooperation, geopolitical instability, and many other factors on Iran's sustainable development. Based on an in depth analysis of current state of energy sector in Iran and the characteristics of a sustainable energy system, I propose strategies and policies that can result in a more sustainable energy sector which in turn contributes to the economic prosperity, social and environmental well-being and higher energy security. by Zanyar Golabi.

When energy is discussed in South Africa, it is usually {{in the context of}} power generation and electricity distribution. This study focuses on another key component of the energy sector in the form of liquid fuel. Most of this energy is consumed for transportation purposes. The energy consumption of the transport sector in South Africa is large, totalling around 28 % of <b>Total</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Consumption</b> (TFC) in the national energy balances.

A key feature of this thesis is the incorporation of a stochastic analysis in the MCDA model. There are two key motivations for assimilating a stochastic analysis in this investigation. The first one is the evaluation of incorporating such an analysis in an MCDA, as opposed to a more traditional sensitivity analysis. The second motivation is to assess the value of employing stochastic analysis as an input method for analysing a decision problem, where comprehensive field data can be substituted for a relevant range of simulated data.

These losses {{are likely to be}} most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in <b>final</b> <b>consumption.</b> By using more efficient thermal generation the potential remains to reduce energy wastage by almost a third and to cut CO2 emissions accordingly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the <b>total</b> <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> (TFC) for industry, {{transport and}} agriculture sectors in Algeria {{during the decade}} of 1998 - 2008, the <b>total</b> <b>final</b> energy by activity sector and fuel type, the total energy intensity evolution {{and the impact of}} energy consumption in Algeria on the environment. The <b>total</b> <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> (TFC) in 2007 reached 20 million TOE, for 34. 4 million inhabitants occupying 2 393 367 square km of land, and with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) equal to 9 389. 70 million DA (Algerian Dinars). The consumption per capita in Algeria is 1 058. 0 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgOE) per person, while in Morocco, which has nearly the same number of inhabitants it is 458 (kgOE) and in Tunisia the figure is 843 (kgOE). The total gas emission is equal to 46 million tonnes of CO 2 with an average of 3 TECO 2 /TOE. The GDP is equal to 3 232. 2 million DA. Detailed information on different industrial sectors, different transport means sector, as well as the agriculture sector have been presented and discussed in the paper. The final energy intensity in Algeria has stabilized at around $ 0. 53 TOE/ 1000 between the years 2000 and 2003. It has been improved by 2 % between 2003 and 2007, exceeding 0. 41 TOE / 1000, which indicates an elasticity of about 1. 23. This performance is due to an optimization of the rate of capacity utilization (TUC) of the production system. The energy intensity reflects the degree of dependence of an economy with respect to the energy factor. The higher the energy intensity, the more vulnerable the economy is to the fluctuations in energy cost. Energy intensity is also a relevant indicator according to the obligations taken in the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions of greenhouse gases due to the <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> reached 46 million TCO 2...|$|R
30|$|The Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) of Thailand {{proposed}} {{the plan for}} energy and emission reduction in transportation to support Thailand’s NAMAs. The plan has considered strategies for an effective and sustainable transportation system. Development of transportation infrastructure and mass transport links together with rapid transit system are proposed. Transport demand management and a taxation mechanism to encourage high efficiency vehicles are considered. Finally, encouragement of environmental friendly advanced technologies is proposed. Moreover, the AEDP objective is to promote renewable and alternative energy development to account for 25  % of <b>total</b> <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> According to the above strategy, ethanol, biodiesel, and new fuel for diesel substitution have been targeted to substitute conventional oil by 44  % in 2021 in the transport sector.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Energy {{demands and}} CO 2 {{emissions}} in the transport sector have dramatically increased since Thailand started to transform its economy to an industrialised country. Since 1995, the transport sector has been the largest energy consuming sector in Thailand, accounting for about 38 % of the <b>total</b> <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Road transport, which {{plays an important role}} in economic development, consumed almost 80 % of the energy consumption in the transport sector and also produced an extremely large amount of CO 2 emissions. Because of dramatically increasing of oil price and environmental impact concern, various policy measures are sought and introduced in order to reduce energy demand and also to mitigate related emissions in this sector. The measures include efforts to increase energy efficienc...|$|R
