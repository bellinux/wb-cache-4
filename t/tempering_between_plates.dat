The Limited Contact Dynamics Compression Plate (LC-DCP) is normally used to create the distance by using the locking screws.

The interfragmentary strain is the main factor of femur-fractured healing. While the interfragmentary modulus is the new interesting factor of the stability of the femur and plate.

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} comprehensive {{properties of}} cylinder steel, high-pressure cylinder steel 30 CrMo-M was developed {{on the basis}} of steel 30 CrMo. Tests and researches were made on factors which influence heat treatment properties, such as chemical composition, quenching temperature, and tempering temperature. The results indicated that the 30 CrMo-M steel has stable chemical composition, its strength rises with increase of carbon equivalent, and thus it has better relativity. When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus safety of cylinder is improved. <b>Tempered</b> <b>between</b> 570 ℃~ 622 ℃, the strength of the steel is increased and plasticity rises with increase of temperature. When tempered at 570 ℃, inner wall structure of cylinder contains tempering martensite, the strength is high but the plasticity is low. When <b>tempered</b> <b>between</b> 610 ℃~ 615 ℃, temper brittleness happens very easily and toughness is on the low side. The best heat treatment technology is: quenched at 930 ℃ with temperature holding for 40 minutes and quenching liquid concentration as 5 %, tempered at 580 ℃ with temperature kept for 90 minutes. The microstructure treated by this technology is tempered sorbite with higher strength, plasticity and toughness...|$|R

40|$|We study {{some aspects}} of {{hydrophobic}} interaction between molecular rough and flexible model surfaces. The model we use in this work {{is based on a}} model we used previously (Eun, C.; Berkowitz, M. L. J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 13222 - 13228), when we studied the interaction between model patches of lipid membranes. Our original model consisted of two graphene plates with attached polar headgroups; the plates were immersed in a water bath. The interaction <b>between</b> such <b>plates</b> can be considered {{as an example of a}} hydrophilic interaction. In the present work we modify our previous model by removing the charge from the zwitterionic headgroups. As a result of this procedure, the plate character changes; it becomes hydrophobic. By separating the total interaction (or potential of mean force, PMF) <b>between</b> <b>plates</b> into the direct and the water-mediated interactions we observe that the latter changes from repulsive to attractive, clearly emphasizing the important role of water as a medium. We also investigate the effect of roughness and flexibility of the headgroups on the interaction <b>between</b> <b>plates</b> and observe that roughness enhances the character of the hydrophobic interaction. The presence of a dewetting transition in a confined space <b>between</b> charge-removed <b>plates</b> confirms that the interaction <b>between</b> <b>plates</b> is strongly hydrophobic. In addition, we notice that there is a shallow local minimum in the PMF in case of charge-removed plates. We find that this minimum is associated with the configurational changes that flexible headgroups undergo, as the two plates are brought together. Comment: 27 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

50|$|In {{quantum field}} theory the {{existence}} of virtual particles is proposed, which lead to the so-called Casimir effect. Casimir calculated that <b>between</b> two <b>plates</b> only particles with specific wavelengths should be counted when calculating the vacuum energy. Therefore, the energy density <b>between</b> the <b>plates</b> is less if the plates are close together, leading to a net attractive force <b>between</b> the <b>plates.</b> However, the conceptual framework of this effect {{is very different from}} the theory of Fatio and Le Sage.|$|R
50|$|A {{prediction}} made by {{this assertion}} {{is that the}} speed of a photon will be increased if it travels <b>between</b> two Casimir <b>plates.</b> Because of the limited amount of space <b>between</b> the two <b>plates,</b> some virtual particles present in vacuum fluctuations will have wavelengths that are too large to fit <b>between</b> the <b>plates.</b> This causes the effective density of virtual particles <b>between</b> the <b>plates</b> to be lower than that outside the plates. Therefore, a photon that travels <b>between</b> these <b>plates</b> will spend less time interacting with virtual particles because there are fewer of them to slow it down. The ultimate effect would be to increase the apparent speed of that photon. The closer the plates are, the lower the virtual particle density, and the higher the speed of light.|$|R
