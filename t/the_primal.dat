5|$|Wizards of the Coast {{was founded}} by Peter Adkison in 1990 just outside Seattle, Washington, and its current {{headquarters}} are located in nearby Renton. Originally the company only published role-playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own <b>The</b> <b>Primal</b> Order. The 1992 release of <b>The</b> <b>Primal</b> Order, a supplement designed for use with any game system, brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium's game and system. The suit was settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and <b>the</b> <b>primal</b> therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The {{minority}} that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make <b>the</b> <b>Primals</b> extinct, and <b>the</b> novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save <b>the</b> <b>Primals</b> from extinction.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: Duality ~Arrangement Album~ is a Blu-ray {{album of}} rock and piano {{arrangements}} of music from Heavensward. It features arrangements by Soken, GUNN, and Keiko of pieces originally composed by Soken for the game, and was published by Square Enix on December 7, 2016. Like From Astral to Umbral, it is split between piano and rock band covers; the first six tracks are piano covers, performed by Keiko, of field and town themes from the game, while the following seven are rock covers by Soken's band <b>The</b> <b>Primals</b> of <b>the</b> musical themes from the game of <b>the</b> <b>primals.</b> <b>The</b> final track on the album is an acoustic and vocal cover of Oblivion, which was a rock song in the original game.|$|R
500|$|... {{also known}} as Final Fantasy XIV Online, is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows personal computers, developed and published by Square Enix in 2010. It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire {{and the threat of}} <b>the</b> <b>Primals,</b> <b>the</b> deities of the land's Beastmen tribes. Eventually, they are embroiled in a plot by a Garlean Legatus to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Primals</b> by bringing one of the planet's moons down on Eorzea.|$|R
5|$|The same {{statements}} {{hold more}} generally for constraint satisfaction problems (or for relational structures, in other words). The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded {{number of variables}} (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 {{in the case of}} graphs). The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of <b>the</b> <b>primal</b> constraint graph.|$|E
5|$|Yagdra {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>primal</b> zerg pack {{leaders of}} Zerus. Yagdra closely resembled an ash worm in appearance, and it was {{considerably}} larger in stature than most other primal zerg. It could spit gobs of destructive acid that burnt like fire.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shaivism sect, {{the highest}} form of Shiva is formless, limitless, transcendent and unchanging {{absolute}} Brahman, and <b>the</b> <b>primal</b> Atman (soul, self) of the universe. Shiva has many benevolent and fearsome depictions. In benevolent aspects, he {{is depicted as}} an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash {{as well as a}} householder with wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva, regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and arts.|$|E
50|$|Final Fantasy XIV (Fainaru Fantajī Fōtīn), {{also known}} as Final Fantasy XIV Online, is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows personal computers, developed and published by Square Enix in 2010. It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire {{and the threat of}} <b>the</b> <b>Primals,</b> <b>the</b> deities of the land's Beastmen tribes.

50|$|In 4th edition, druids and shamans are {{no longer}} divine spellcasters; instead, they use <b>the</b> new <b>primal</b> power source, along with barbarians and the new warden class. Primal magic is {{associated}} with the nature and <b>the</b> feywild. <b>Primal</b> powers are called evocations.|$|R
30|$|Thus the adjoint {{problem for}} <b>the</b> ill-posed <b>primal</b> problem {{contains}} four boundary conditions, despite there being only three variables. Therefore, <b>the</b> ill-posed <b>primal</b> problem {{leads to an}} adjoint inconsistent formulation, specifically in the boundary terms. Such an adjoint inconsistency can lead to oscillations in the discrete solutions of the adjoint problem [24].|$|R
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, as well as <b>the</b> <b>primal</b> sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be offended by <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E
5|$|When Yagdra {{learned that}} Sarah Kerrigan was {{transforming}} in a chrysalis, it attempted {{to halt the}} process permanently by sending its pack at Kerrigan's brood. In the process, Yagdra also eradicated the last remnants of Brakk's now-leaderless pack, however, it was not successful in killing the Queen of Blades before she hatched from her chrysalis. The opportunity came soon enough, however, when Kerrigan, now <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> Queen of Blades, set out to challenge the pack leaders for control of Zerus. She came for Yagdra first. Aided by Dehaka's Pack, Kerrigan fought her way through Yagdra's minions and confronted the pack leader himself. Yagdra {{told her that her}} transformation meant nothing. The two fought, and Kerrigan emerged victorious. After slaying Yagdra, she absorbed his essence.|$|E

5|$|The Kobold {{tribe in}} La Noscea, angered at the Lominsans' {{encroachment}} upon their ancestral territories, gathers crystals to summon their primal, Titan. In response, the player is dispatched to interview {{former members of}} the Company of Heroes, a band of mercenaries who previously defeated Titan and Leviathan in the Sixth Astral Era, for advice on how to combat <b>the</b> <b>primal.</b> After a series of lessons disguised as menial tasks, the company's leader reveals how to access Titan's domain: by reversing the current through the beastmen's own teleportation crystals. Though the adventurer banishes Titan to the aether, the victory is short-lived. While away, Garlean Tribunus Livia sas Junius had broken into the Scions' headquarters at the Waking Sands with the aid of the Ascians, abducting Minfilia and slaughtering the rest. While performing funerary rites for fallen comrades, the headstrong Alphinaud returns with news of a new primal Garuda being summoned by the Ixal tribe. He hatches a plan to confront Garuda in her own domain, but requires the aid of the amnesiac airship engineer Cid Garlond, currently toiling as a cemetery hand.|$|E
5|$|Originally a Terran ghost {{agent for}} Arcturus Mengsk, she is betrayed and {{abandoned}} to the Zerg, who transform {{her into a}} Terran/Zerg hybrid with vast psionic powers {{under the control of}} the then unknown Amon. Following the death of the Overmind, Kerrigan asserts her independence, striking out at those who betrayed her and who seek to contain her, eventually taking control of the entire Zerg Swarm. Four years later, Kerrigan invades the Dominion in search of a number of Xel'Naga artifacts; these artifacts are instead retrieved by Raynor at the behest of the Moebius Foundation, who assembles them into a device that reverts Kerrigan to a human and releases Amon's grip on her. After her deinfestation, Kerrigan is mercilessly pursued by Arcturus Mengsk, however she successfully escapes Arcturus's Dominion forces. After willingly allowing herself to be reinfested on Zerus, Kerrigan is reborn as <b>the</b> <b>Primal</b> Queen of Blades, after which she successfully reunites the Zerg Swarm and storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal with help from Raynor's Raiders. After a showdown with Arcturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Acturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In the aftermath of her victory, Kerrigan gathers the Swarm and departs in search of Amon.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of <b>the</b> <b>primal,</b> First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
