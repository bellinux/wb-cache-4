5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to jump in and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the <b>target</b> <b>market</b> of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E

40|$|Businesses {{may not be}} in a {{position}} to satisfy all of their customers, every time. It may prove difficult to meet the exact requirements of each individual customer. People do not have identical preferences, so rarely does one product completely satisfy everyone. Many companies may usually adopt a strategy that is known as <b>target</b> <b>marketing.</b> This strategy involves dividing the market into segments and developing products or services to these segments. A <b>target</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy is focused on the customers’ needs and wants. Hence, a prerequisite for the development of this customer-centric strategy is the specification of the <b>target</b> <b>markets</b> that the companies will attempt to serve. The marketing managers who may consider using <b>target</b> <b>marketing</b> will usually break the market down into groups and to target the most profitable segments. They may adapt their marketing mix elements, including; products, prices, channels, and promotional tactics to suit the requirements of individual consumers. In sum, this chapter explains the three stages of <b>target</b> <b>marketing,</b> including; market segmentation (ii) <b>market</b> <b>targeting</b> and (iii) <b>market</b> positioning. peer-reviewe...|$|R

25|$|The {{situation}} is slightly more complex if electronic formatting {{is to be}} used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, {{there is no reason}} to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the <b>target</b> <b>market</b> to those who read French.|$|E
25|$|The <b>target</b> <b>market</b> is the U.S. Air National Guard {{and foreign}} nations that cannot afford the F-35, but want an {{aircraft}} to perform ISR and light attack missions better than turboprop planes. Buying and sustaining the Scorpion would {{cost less than}} A-10 or F-16 upgrades. For air patrol, the Scorpion requires radar and the capability of supersonic flight, similar to the unsuccessful 1980s-era Northrop F-20 Tigershark. The market for light fixed-wing attack jets had declined in the 1980s as richer countries opted for more capable aircraft and poorer countries pursued turboprops and attack helicopters. It is uncertain if the Scorpion will be cheaper or outperform turboprops or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in terms of range, endurance, low-altitude performance, and sensors.|$|E

25|$|Reception to the Nintendo 2DS was mixed; while Nintendo {{was praised}} for how it priced and {{positioned}} the 2DS alongside its higher-end counterparts, {{much of its}} criticism was directed towards its regressions {{in comparison to the}} 3DS, such as a design that some considered less appealing than that of the 3DS, its lower sound quality, and its battery life. However, the 2DS's design was praised by some critics for being more robust and comfortable to hold than the 3DS, especially for its <b>target</b> <b>market.</b> Some critics also felt that the lack of 3D support was an admission by Nintendo that the concept was a fad; however, Nintendo has since stated that autostereoscopic 3D would remain a part of their future plans.|$|E

The first step was taken in October 2005, when the general meeting approved the new name, Catalyst Paper, to signal that the group was leaving Norske Skog. The Norwegian group sold its 29.4 percent of Catalyst for $186 million in a bought deal on 30 January 2006. At the time Catalyst's four mills made it North America's fourth-largest producer of printing papers, with an annual production of two million tonnes of paper and half a million tonnes of kraft pulp.|$|E

Canberra had previously been mentioned as a <b>target</b> <b>market</b> that Netball NSW was keen to host more ANZ Championship games. The Gold Coast, being the most populated city in Australia or New Zealand to not have an ANZ Championship team, has also been mooted as a possibility. The Queensland Firebirds host several ANZ Championship games at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre every year, often in front of a sellout crowd. The Gold Coast will also host the 2018 Commonwealth Games netball competition and world class facilities will be in place by 2017.

25|$|There {{were two}} {{magazines}} named Sports Illustrated {{before the current}} magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created Sports Illustrated with a <b>target</b> <b>market</b> for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released Sports Illustrated in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against Sport and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly {{and they did not}} cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that Time patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including Life magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right.|$|E

On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E
