5|$|Booker assumed {{office as}} mayor of Newark on July 1, 2006. After his first week in office, he {{announced}} a 100-day plan to implement reforms in Newark. <b>The</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> included increasing police forces, ending background checks for many city jobs to help former offenders find employment in the city, refurbishing police stations, improving city services, and expanding summer youth programs.|$|E
5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes,</b> fearing {{their own}} lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} {{dependence on the}} Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{correlation study}} {{is concerned with}} accounting practitioners 2 ̆ 7 receptivity to a <b>propose</b> <b>change</b> in accounting education; specifically, that the existing three year degree course be extended to four years.

A model of accounting practitioners 2 ̆ 7 receptivity towards <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> at <b>the</b> adoption stage, was revised and adapted from a general model of teacher receptivity to any system-wide change. The revised model has one dependent variable, receptivity, which is measured in three aspects; overall feelings, attitudes, and general behaviour intentions towards <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> in accounting education. It has eight Independent variables, {{and a number of}} situation variables. These independent variables are; attitudes towards the structure and content of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> general beliefs about the change based on the expanding scope of accounting practice, overall feelings about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} accounting graduates, overall feelings about alleviating fears and uncertainties of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> overall feelings about the practicality of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> in <b>the</b> lecture room and tutorial room in two aspects, general behaviour intentions about expectations and achievements for <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> and general behaviour intentions to support instructors and the accounting profession.

5|$|In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth {{publicly}} supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting {{criticism from}} opponents of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes,</b> including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed {{in a military}} coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth – which were contradicted by the Palace – and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. The involvement of younger {{members of the royal}} family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed, and the Queen was the target of satire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered.

A replacement designation for NY47 north of NY104 was not named at the time. Most of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-590 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Rochester–Irondequoit leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY590, which continued north to Sea Breeze over former NY47.|$|E

As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece—would become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates–Greece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY390. The NY390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed.|$|E

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E

One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient.
