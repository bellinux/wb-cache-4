40|$|This randomized, open-label, active-controlled, dose-finding phase IIb study {{evaluated}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>trabedersen</b> (AP 12009) administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent/refractory high-grade glioma. One hundred and forty-five patients with central reference histopathology of recurrent/refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive <b>trabedersen</b> at doses of 10 or 80 µM or standard chemotherapy (temozolomide or procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine). Primary endpoint was 6 -month tumor control rate, and secondary endpoints included response at further timepoints, survival, and safety. Six-month tumor control rates were not significantly different in the entire study population (AA and GBM). Prespecified AA subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit regarding the 14 -month tumor control rate for 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> vs chemotherapy (p=. 0032). The 2 -year survival rate had a trend for superiority for 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> vs chemotherapy (p =. 10). Median survival for 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> was 39. 1 months compared with 35. 2 months for 80 µM <b>trabedersen</b> and 21. 7 months for chemotherapy (not significant). In GBM patients, response and survival results were comparable among the 3 arms. Exploratory analysis on GBM patients aged ≤ 55 years with Karnofsky performance status > 80 % at baseline indicated a 3 -fold survival at 2 and 3 years for 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> vs chemotherapy. The frequency of patients with related or possibly drug-related adverse events was higher with standard chemotherapy (64 %) than with 80 µM <b>trabedersen</b> (43 %) and 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> (27 %). Superior efficacy and safety for 10 µM <b>trabedersen</b> over 80 µM <b>trabedersen</b> and chemotherapy and positive risk-benefit assessment suggest it as the optimal dose for further clinical development in high-grade glioma...|$|E
40|$|Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) {{have been}} widely used to {{determine}} gene function, validate drug targets and as novel therapeutics for human diseases. In this review, we describe the development of AS-ODNs, including their modifications, pharmacokinetics and toxicity in animal models and humans, and their preclinical and clinical development in the therapy of human high-grade gliomas. The most advanced AS-ODN for the therapy of high-grade gliomas is a phosphorothioate-modified AS-ODN, AP 12009 (<b>trabedersen),</b> which targets mRNA encoding TGF-beta 2. AP 12009 is administered intratumorally using convection-enhanced delivery. A series of Phase I and II clinical trials have evaluated the toxicity profile and optimal dose of the substance. A randomized, controlled international Phase III study was initiated in March 2009 and will compare <b>trabedersen</b> 10 microM versus conventional alkylating chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or refractory anaplastic astrocytoma after standard radio- and chemotherapy...|$|E
30|$|Despite these {{inherent}} challenges, {{strategies to}} inhibit CAFs {{have been tried}} at numerous potential points of intervention. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used in the clinical setting for treatment of numerous malignancies, decreased the viability of CAFs in vitro by inhibiting expression of alpha-SMA [127]. Another approach targeting TGFβ uses the antisense oligonucleotide AP- 12009 {{for the treatment of}} glioma [128]. At present, AP- 12009 (<b>Trabedersen)</b> is being prepared to be tested in a phase II clinical trial for systemic IV administration in malignant melanoma and pancreatic cancer.|$|E
40|$|High-grade gliomas are {{the most}} common primary tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) in adults. Despite efforts to improve {{treatment}} by combination therapies (neurosurgery, radio- and chemotherapy), high-grade glioma patients still have a grim prognosis, indicating an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The molecular processes of gliomagenesis are being unraveled, and novel targeted therapeutic strategies to defy high-grade gliomas are emerging. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), in particular the TGF-β 2 isoform, has been identified as a key factor in the progression of malignant gliomas. TGF-β 2, originally described as "glioblastoma-derived T-cell suppressor factor", is associated with the immuno-suppressed status of patients with glioblastoma, and is therefore responsible for loss of tumor immune surveillance. Elevated TGF-β 2 levels in tumors and in the plasma of patients have been associated with advanced disease stage and poor prognosis. Consequently, a targeted strategy to modulate TGF-β 2 signaling is highly promising. The antisense oligonucleotide <b>trabedersen</b> (AP 12009) that specifically blocks TGF-β 2 mRNA will be the main focus of this review. In three phase I/II studies and a randomized, active-controlled dose-finding phase IIb study, <b>trabedersen</b> treatment of high-grade glioma patients with recurrent or refractory tumor disease led to long-lasting tumor responses and so far promising survival data. On the basis of these data the currently ongoing phase III study SAPHIRRE was initiated...|$|E
