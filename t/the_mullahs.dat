25|$|In {{response}} to his inability to continue his own education, Bacha Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) as a buffer for the British Raj from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. The oppression of the British, the repression of <b>the</b> <b>mullahs,</b> and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Bacha Khan to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Bacha Khan opened his first school in Utmanzai. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers.|$|E

[...] In the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, waqf holdings are very large (in Khorasan Province, [...] "50% of the cultivated lands belong to the religious foundation Astan-i Quds, which oversees" [...] the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad).

Although Mortaza Motahhari had not any disagreement to establishing party but at the same time he hadn’t any communication with party.

The party has established formally on 17 February 1979, namely two weeks after the victory of Islamic Revolution. The members of the party even determined their members in Kanoon Touhid in early days. The financial expenses of party originated from the voluntary aids of people.
