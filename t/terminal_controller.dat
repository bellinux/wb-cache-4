After the hand-off, the aircraft is given a frequency change and begins talking to the next controller. This process continues until the aircraft is handed off to a <b>terminal</b> <b>controller</b> ("approach").|$|E

50|$|Interactive use of VS/9 {{was done}} through {{terminals}} {{connected to a}} terminal concentrator unit, which passed control signals {{to and from the}} terminals, {{in a manner similar to}} the way IBM would provide with its IBM 3270-style terminals. This provided, in general, for input to the terminal to be sent in response to an enter key, as opposed to the practice on PCs of taking input one character at a time. The concentrator unit was originally known as the Communications Control Module, or CCM. However, RCA had sold the patents and designs for its CCM <b>terminal</b> <b>controller</b> to Singer Corporation, so Univac developed an emulator device for the CCM which was known as the Multiterminal Connection Controller model 16, or MCC-16.|$|E

The last Sanders Intelligent terminal system marketed was the 814 <b>terminal</b> <b>controller</b> that supported up to eight terminals.

50|$|In 1976, IBM {{announced}} the IBM Series/1, {{the successor to}} the System/7. The Series/1 was the last {{in the line of}} special purpose sensor-based computers produced by IBM. The Laboratory Automation Group in SJRL acquired an early model of the Series/1 and by announcement time had ported LABS/7 to the Series/1. LABS/7 became EDX/1, the Event Driven Executive which, of course, included an embedded interpreter for the programming language which was appropriately named EDL (Event Driven Language). At the same time, IBM's field support team was expanded and a significant effort was underway to make the software available to IBM customers as a Field Developed Program or FDP. An FDP was a step up in the IBM software hierarchy but still had the caveat of an “as is” package with minimal formal IBM support. With the development of a powerful terminal control product known as the Communications Facility (EDX/CF), the sales of EDX was especially focused on a distributed computing environment whereby the Series/1 was used primarily as a <b>terminal</b> <b>controller,</b> in many cases attached to a System/370 host computer. EDX was a very efficient system able to support a large number of work stations. As the installed base of EDX grew, the product support for EDX was transferred to the IBM General Systems Division, the Series/1 product division, in Boca Raton, FL and EDX became a fully supported IBM program product. EDX had its origin as a tool for Laboratory Automation and in 1981, IBM announced a Series/1 & EDX-based application software package, EDX Laboratory Automation Software which was developed at the SJRL, as an IUP, product number 5798-RHB.|$|E

These trajectories may be any feasible trajectories of the system terminating in an invariant set that contains the origin and are not restricted to consist of equilibrium points only. The resulting <b>terminal</b> <b>controller</b> is the solution of an optimization problem depending on the state and is therefore in general a nonlinear function.
