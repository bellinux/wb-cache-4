40|$|This {{paper is}} {{based in part on}} an earlier {{publication}} on SMCP development, but includes new chapters on sociolinguistic and cultural issues arising during pilot’s taking the vessel into/out of harbour with tug assistance. In this case the multinational, multilingual and multicultural bridge team is further extended onto pilot/s communicating with the <b>tug</b> <b>master(s).</b> A request has been made by the IFSMA 2 to provide shipmasters with a set of phrases for pilots and <b>tug</b> <b>masters</b> in their working language - English - to be used during manoeuvring, since the existing Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) have not been considered elaborate enough for the operation. Maritime English lecturers twinned with maritime professionals have provided a set of appropriate phrases and exercises to help students/ trainees adopt them, as the conclusion of the 2014 seminar organized by G. A. M. E. - Gesellschaft für Ausbildung in Maritimem Englisch (German Association for Maritime English) with the seat at Bremen University of Applied Sciences, Nautical Department, {{in order to meet the}} requirements from the maritime industry. A sociolinguistic and cultural issue has arisen as a result of the IFSMA’s invitation to G. A. M. E for a further development of the SMCP Pilotage and Tug Assistance Phrases and for presentation of the newly developed phrases for assessment to the IMO as a most influential safety factor. It would be a great benefit for shipmasters worldwide who regularly find themselves in situations when they cannot follow the pilot’s communication with the <b>tug</b> <b>master(s)</b> because it is carried out in a local language and the pilot, due to being involved in communication with several external parties, is often not in the position to translate the communication for the ship’s master due to the shortage of time. This intention of the IFSMA has met an overt disagreement by the pilot representatives taking part in the activities of the 2014 G. A. M. E. seminar and previously by the EMPA as their association. Therefore, following the approach starting from Rogers’ Diffusion of innovations theory (1960), revised later by Clarke (1999) and Orr (2003), is proposed here to present the stages through which a technological innovation, this extension of SMCP being rightfully considered one, passes on its way to successful adoption...|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of next-generation technologies to the maritime shipping industry, including Portable Pilotage Units, Remote Pilotage, advanced situation awareness aids, and Autonomous Shipping, creates {{an urgent need}} to understand operator workload during Bridge Team operations, and co-operations with shore based personnel. In this paper we analyse mental workload of maritime Captains, Pilots and <b>Tug</b> <b>Masters</b> during standard and emergency scenarios, using traditional measures (SWAT, ISA), communications analysis, and the collection of simultaneous electro-dermal activity (EDA) of team members. Results indicate that the EDA measure overcomes {{some of the problems}} with paper-based techniques, and has excellent temporal resolution for emergency events. Implications for testing of novel technologies are discussed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe task of {{maritime}} pilots is {{to support}} safe navigation of ships, e. g. in port waters, and berthing in harbors. Contemporary ships tend to become continually larger due to economic needs. This trend makes the job of pilots more and more challenging. As a consequence the need for electronic support specifically tailored to pilots’ practical requirements grows. The paper will present a graphical user interface design based on Smart Glasses to support pilots in harbor maneuvers. In many harbors, pilots are already supported by Portable Pilot Units (PPUs) usually displaying navigational information on a tablet or laptop. These devices require pilots to look down and to move their gaze away from the most important information source, the direct ship environment. Smart Glasses would allow the pilot to continually look outside {{of the window and}} thereby keep focused on the relevant working context. The graphical design has been developed using the well-established Ecological Interface Design (EID) method [16]. This approach has the aim to create interfaces which provide assistance to detect and solve problems especially in unforeseen situations. In accordance with the EID approach we performed a Work Domain Analysis and developed an abstraction hierarchy of the ship in its environment. Additionally, we conducted empirical studies to derive interface requirements in close cooperation with pilots from different harbors in Germany. The interface design takes into account the complete socio-technical system consisting of pilot, vessel, vessel crew, and supporting <b>tugs</b> and <b>tug</b> <b>masters.</b> A prototype has been developed on state-of-the-art Smart Glass devices. The design has finally been evaluated using a scenario-based interview technique. This evaluation underlined the promising opportunities of Smart Glasses for pilots and allowed to derive further requirements to tailor the design even more to the practical needs of pilots...|$|R

While 41 Squadron fought the fighters, 501 Squadron attacked the Ju87s {{as they began to}} dive and the harbour suffered little damage. StG 1 and LG 1 lost two Stukas each and II./StG 3 reported one damaged, 501 Squadron suffering no losses. The steamer SS Gronland was sunk in the outer harbour, having already been damaged in the attacks of the 25 July and 19 crew were killed and the patrol yacht Gulzar was sunk but the crew were saved; Sandhurst was destroyed.

30|$|Participants {{recruited}} {{for the study}} were all experts. Participants consisted of a distributed maritime operations team, including an experienced Captain (male, 31  years old, 5  years experience in current role), Pilot (male, 52  years old, 10  years experience in current role), Helmsman (male, 65  years old, unknown years experience), and <b>Tug</b> <b>Master</b> (male, 50  years old, 2  years experience in current role).|$|E
30|$|Much of {{the prior}} {{research}} into cognitive workload has employed subjective paper-based tests of workload, as described above. In {{order to determine}} the suitability of such questionnaires for measuring team workload in a maritime operations setting, we tested the maritime operations team (Captain/Master, Pilot, <b>Tug</b> <b>Master</b> and Helmsman) within standard training runs in the maritime full-mission simulator, using both the ISA and the SWAT metrics.|$|E
30|$|For this {{simulation}} run, {{the following}} vessels were involved: Offen 4100, (Panamax container vessel, 281  m, top speed 20 knots); Hual Trooper (Car Carrier, 200  m, top speed 21 knots); Keera (34  m tug) and the Marysville (25  m tug). The scenario involved standard communications {{between the three}} main stations (Bridge, VTS, and <b>Tug</b> <b>Master)</b> via VHF radio, and additionally with the Hual Trooper on VHF radio. The VTS was located in a separate room, and manned by two VTS operators (one experienced, one trainee). The separate operations centres communicated {{by way of a}} real VHF radio system.|$|E
30|$|In {{light of}} the {{preceding}} analysis, and faced {{with the question of}} operator performance and workload when considering the inclusion of new technologies in the maritime environment, our team decided to investigate synchronous electrophysiology (Electro-Dermal Activity) among members of the bridge-pilot-tug team. This methodology has the advantage that each participant’s EDA signal can be monitored wirelessly via a remote transmitter / receiver apparatus, and the electrodes can be designed as to not interfere overly with standard operating procedures. As such, we were able to obtain synchronous electro-dermal responses from multiple team members, without negatively impacting the realism of the simulated ship-board procedures. In this manner, we collected simultaneous EDA signals from the Pilot, the Captain, and the <b>Tug</b> <b>master,</b> during runs in which a critical event occurred.|$|E
30|$|Further, {{examination}} of the EDA signals {{in relation to the}} emergency events, in particular those in Session 2, indicate that this methodology can illustrate how team member’s workload fluctuates together. Specifically, during the communications failure in Session 2 Run 1, the Tug collided with the main vessel at two points, which are clearly visible in the Tug’s EDA measure at 6 and 9  min. Further, in Session 2 Run 2, {{at the onset of the}} communications failure around the 10  min mark, it can be clearly seen how the Tug and Pilot EDA levels increase sharply, while the Captains EDA signal remains at a lower level. This potentially indicates that the Pilot and <b>Tug</b> <b>Master</b> found the communications failure more taxing, while the Captain remained relatively calm.|$|E
30|$|We present three {{case studies}} in this paper. In each case, the {{participants}} were experienced maritime professionals consisting of Ships Master / Captain (responsible for safe conduct of ship), Pilot (a local addition to the bridge team, who in practice takes over the manoeuvring and leads the communication), <b>Tug</b> <b>Master</b> (tugs are small powerful vessels that assist in manoeuvring large ships in restricted waters, either connected by rope/wire or pushing), Helmsman (performs the steering, on orders from master/pilot but no other tasks), and Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Operator (VTS is a shore-based information service, much like air traffic control but with no mandate to give orders). First of all, we present an analysis of operator workload using the ISA (Instantaneous Self Assessment) and the SWAT (Subjective Workload Assessment Technique) that are commonly employed in the literature (Cain, 2007). These measures were chosen for their prevalence in the workload literature, {{and because they are}} straightforward to administer and analyse. Second, an analysis of communications patterns during emergency manoeuvres is presented as an additional means of understanding operator workload within the maritime environment. These studies illustrate some of the drawbacks to using the standard ISA/SWAT methodology, and provide some insight regarding communication patterns during an emergency event. Finally, we conducted a series of maritime operations while collecting GSR/EDA measures for the key team players: the Captain/Master, the Pilot, and the <b>Tug</b> <b>Master.</b> The use of GSR/EDA measurement allowed us to collect workload measures from a distributed team of maritime personnel as they performed routine and emergency manoeuvres in a large maritime ship simulator. It has the clear advantage of detecting the onset and relative level of operator stress (a robust correlate of mental workload), and further, of capturing this information for multiple individuals within a distributed team operating environment.|$|E
30|$|A {{single factor}} design ({{prototype}} device present vs. prototype device absent) {{was used for}} this study, with an emergency event occurring midway through each run. Participants either conducted the individual scenarios using standard maritime protocol (i.e. all comms carried out over UHF radio), or used the prototype PPU device to facilitate an understanding of relative position between tugs and vessel. Participants were provided information and consent forms and conducted a training and familiarization run, after which actual experiment commenced. Simulations were carried out over two days. The Pilot and Captain worked together on the ship’s bridge (with a live Helmsman, who had no EDA monitor), while the <b>Tug</b> <b>Master</b> operated a separate simulated vessel from a remote control centre. Apart from the baseline simulation run in which no specific events occurred, the testing runs were designed to focus upon a particular hazard common to maritime environments.|$|E
40|$|Shiphandling tugs are a {{critical}} aspect of ship manoeuvring in confined waters. Knowledge {{of their performance}} and effective use in various situations provide necessary guidance for the marine pilot and <b>tug</b> <b>master</b> to improve shiphandling techniques. Shiphandling simulators are a well accepted tool for training of marine pilots, development of port operational procedures and port development studies. Realistic simulation of shiphandling manoeuvres requires not only a reliable hydrodynamic model of the ship, but also precise representation of the forces available from the assisting tugs. In the past, the limited capabilities of tugs meant that force prediction and evaluation of operating procedures was a relatively simple matter. However, the push for expanding and more efficient port operations {{has led to a}} new generation of shiphandling tugs being introduced into major Australian ports during the 1980 's. These tugs are of greater displacement, power and manoeuvrability compared with their twin screw predecessors and represent a significant technological step. Increased manoeuvrability of the so called omni-directional stern drive tug has been achieved through the fitting of azimuthing thrusters, which are capable of producing thrust in any direction. The enhanced manoeuvrability of the omni-directional stern drive tug and increased power has enabled significant increases {{to be made in the}} efficiency of shiphandling operations, particularly in the ability to assist at speed. However, to fully realise the potential of these complex vessels a more thorough understanding of their hydrodynamic aspects is required. Further, with increased speed greater consideration needs to be given to the interaction of tug forces with those produced by the ship's rudder, propeller and hull. To investigate the performance and effectiveness of omni-directional stern drive tugs, a series of physical model tests has been performed. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and thrusters have been measured, with particular attention being paid to hydrodynamic interactions between thrusters and the thrusters and hull. Measurements were initially made of forces acting on a bare tug hull and a single thruster in open water. Thruster-thruster interaction was determined from measurement of forces acting on twin thrusters in open water and thruster-hull interaction was determined from measurement of total forces and those acting on the thrusters of a self-propelled free-running model. Data derived from the model tests has been used to construct a mathematical model which may be solved using equilibrium or, in the time domain, as may be desired for real time simulation. Quasi-steady predictions of tug forces have been used to identify general performance, optimum operating techniques and the influence of tug forces on ship motions in confined waters. In cooperation with Australian towage operators, practical findings from this investigation have been detailed in a manual to assist tug masters and marine pilots. In addition to harbour tugs, this work may also provide insight into the manoeuvring of escort tugs and other vessels with omni-directional propulsion...|$|E
