5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as {{the chorus}} of soldiers and adventurers sing about the joy of reaching the shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother. Due to his fighting prowess, Nantaquas thinks he is a god, but Smith explains he is only a trained warrior from across the sea. The Indians capture Smith {{to bring him to}} their chief. Back at the Powhatan River, Robin attempts to seduce Alice, but is foiled by Walter and Larry. When Walter tells the group about Smith’s capture, they depart <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> Before they leave, Rolfe tries to convince Percy to move on after his lover, Geraldine, apparently was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, Day and his troop were {{transferred}} west to New Mexico where {{they joined the}} rest of the regiment.

6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} be ashamed of himself." [...] Patsy indignantly asserted. [...] "The man {{admitted}} to Uncle John that Ajo is the biggest stockholder in the Continental, the president, to boot; yet Goldstein wouldn't lift a finger to help him and positively refused to obey his request <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>after</b> he was arrested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you start}} ragging me," [...] said {{the young man}} called Bunker. [...] "I'm only too glad not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{trailing}} <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> He doesn't {{know a thing about}} maps or money or hotels or anything, and I have to dance about like a courier. As for my uncle, as I'm supposed to come into the estate, it's only decent to be here sometimes." ...|$|R
50|$|Craig {{returns to}} Blackpool and agrees {{to take the}} fight. Matt, {{preparing}} for the club opening, decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Blackpool <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> Kelvin fires him from the club and the record company.

500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, a Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars-inspired space fight is shown between Stewie, Rupert, and a giant {{spaceship}} {{in the shape of}} Peter's head, along with a series of lookalike TIE fighters. In addition, Stewie paraphrases a series of lyrics from the 1972 single [...] "Rocket Man" [...] by singer-songwriter and composer Elton John. When Brian's script is brought up during breakfast, Peter mentions his own idea for a script entitled Bigger Jaws, in which the shark from the 1975 film Jaws has to team up with the guys, including Martin Brody, Quint and Matt Hooper, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> to get [...] "bigger Jaws." [...] After it is produced, Peter already has a sequel in mind called Way Bigger Jaws. A historical cutaway gag portrays Adolf Hitler thinking he is being rejected by the publishing house for his submission of the autobiographical Mein Kampf, in which a publisher tells him, [...] "We didn't like it... we loved it!" [...] – to which Hitler replies, [...] "I could have killed you, Mr. Weinberg!" [...] Most of the storyline following Stewie, Chris and Meg is an homage to the 1989 film Weekend at Bernie's. The episode's title is also a reference to the TBS series Tyler Perry's House of Payne. As the family gathers around the television to watch Brian's show, actors Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men appear in the Griffin family living room, with Sheen attacking Brian for always criticizing their show.|$|E

For a time, Don Eppes' team is {{attempting}} {{to make do with}} Fleinhardt's and Amita's expertise, but Charles' assistance is sorely missed to the point of consulting him secretly. [...] For his part, Charles has been convinced by his lawyer and father to attempt to have his clearance restored. Even Don supports the idea and stands up to security clearance investigator Carl McGowan (Keith Carradine), stating <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> not his brother. Temporarily, Charlie works as a LAPD consultant until the fiasco with his security clearance can be resolved. He later gets his clearance back and is working with his brother and the FBI again. He is trying to assert himself in the methodology used to solve a crime, having struggled with not being included, but some friction arises with Amita and Larry.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} see him," [...] he said once again; [...] "if I did, I should not scruple {{to hit him}} on the head with my stick; but I should think ill of myself <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> with such an object." ...|$|E
60|$|Jim made an {{impatient}} gesture. He had forgotten that Carrie {{had come to}} his help, and although he noted, mechanically, that she was highly strung and bearing some strain, he did not dwell on this. His antagonist had got away. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> not to talk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Colonel <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> {{and found}} him so {{drooping}} and wretched, that he insisted on bringing him home with him, and old Mrs. Meadows and her daughter almost forced him to accept the invitation.' ...|$|R

60|$|Duane yelled {{for him to}} {{stop and}} started <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> Snecker broke into a run. Then Duane set out to {{overhaul}} him.

6000|$|... "Bruin {{has escaped}} us this time," [...] said Lumley, [...] "and I don't feel {{disposed}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> any further.

6000|$|I had {{no heart}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> {{and sat down}} in the hedge. There was {{something}} subtly akin to her in the fresh darkness of the young night; the soft bank, the scent of honeysuckle, the touch of the ferns and brambles. Death comes to all of us, and when it's over it's over; but this blind business--of those left behind! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Of course she's in {{love with}} Bond, but she's too much a lady <b>to</b> <b>go</b> chasing <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> So she smiles and bides her time. In a way, you can't blame her. Every woman would like to live dangerously with James Bond, if only for 20 minutes, or half a night..." [...] Lois Maxwell [...] In both the Bond novels and films based upon them, Moneypenny is smitten with Bond. For example, in the novel Thunderball (1961), Fleming wrote that she [...] "often dreamed hopelessly about Bond." [...] However, she never {{explicitly}} voices these feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "What if I have? I {{like your}} pride, Nina; but be not too proud. Of course I have paid the money. I know Rapinsky, who deals with us often. I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>after</b> {{you spoke to}} me, and got it back again. There is your mother's necklace." ...|$|R

6000|$|Kelley {{received}} his orders with calmness. [...] "Well, Judge," [...] he said, {{after a little}} pause, [...] "I'll get him, but I'd {{like to do it}} in my own way. <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him</b> just now gives him the inside position.

6000|$|... "But {{there was}} one {{question}} I was going to ask, Mr President. Of course I am altogether on your side, and {{do not wish to}} raise difficulties. But what shall I do suppose they take to running away after they have been deposited?

60|$|Half an hour passed, but Jimmy did not return. No one felt {{sufficiently}} energetic <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> We {{had only}} just strength enough to sit still and feebly abuse him.

At the end of {{an hour and a half}} we were glad he had not returned when he ought to have, and were only curious as to what had become of him.|$|E

60|$|There were, indeed, a few letters {{which he}} laid, thankfully, {{in a pile}} by themselves. These were mostly from certain humble members of his parish who had not {{followed}} their impulses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>after</b> the service, or from strangers who had chanced to drop into the church. Some were autobiographical, {{such as those of}} a trained nurse, a stenographer, a hardware clerk who had sat up late Sunday night to summarize what that sermon had meant to him, how a gray and hopeless existence had taken on a new colour. Next Sunday he would bring a friend who lived in the same boarding house.... Hodder read every word of these, and all were in the same strain: at last they could perceive a meaning to religion, an application of it to such plodding lives as theirs....|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} think he's showing us some {{consideration}} in not riding the beast down to the settlement," [...] Blake remarked with a dubious smile, feeling strongly annoyed with himself for not taking more precautions. With the cunning which the lust for drink breeds in its victims Benson had outwitted him by feigning acquiescence. [...] "Anyhow," [...] he added, [...] "I'll have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> We must have the horse, for one thing, but I suppose we'll lose four days. This is rough on you." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that to catch and deal with the fellow there was not the need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> and perhaps spend the day hunting him in that cursed wood. There was Pitt here ready to his hand, and Pitt should tell him the identity of his bashful friend, and also the subject of that close and secret talk he had disturbed. Pitt might, of course, be reluctant. So much the worse for Pitt. The ingenious Colonel Bishop knew a dozen ways--some of them quite diverting--of conquering stubbornness in these convict dogs.|$|E
60|$|Shortly I found a lion track, freshly made, leading down. I {{believed}} I {{could follow}} wherever Don led, so I decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>him.</b> I tied Foxie securely, removed my coat, kicked off spurs and chaps, and remembering past unnecessary toil, fastened a red bandana {{to the top}} of a dead snag to show me where to come up on my way out. Then I carefully strapped my canteen and camera on my back, made doubly secure my revolver, put on my heavy gloves, and started down. And I realized at once that only so lightly encumbered should I have ever ventured down the slope.|$|E
50|$|Marko {{explains}} to Peter that he committed robberies {{to save his}} dying daughter and reveals that while Ben was convincing Marko <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home <b>after</b> getting <b>him</b> out of his car, Carradine hit Marko's elbow, shooting Ben accidentally, plaguing Marko with guilt.

60|$|I {{thought it}} would be besetting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and see <b>after</b> <b>him</b> myself, but I let Dora knock at his door, and heard he had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> bed. To me it was a long night of tossing and half-sleep, hearing the wild stormy wind, and dreaming of strange things, praying all the time that the noble soul might be won for God at last, and almost feeling, like the Icelander during the {{conversion}} of his country, the struggle between the dark spirits and the white.|$|R
5000|$|Taking place {{three years}} after the events in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the Autobots {{continue}} to hunt for the Decepticons despite humanity believing that they have fled the planet, defeated.
