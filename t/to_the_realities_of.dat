5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

25|$|Candidates {{were not}} run in Newfoundland and Labrador, {{as a result}} of ongoing {{divisions}} over Joan Russow's refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John's West by-election. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland's Terra Nova Green Party Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.|$|E
25|$|Even in regiments {{in which}} there was direct confrontation, such as the 74th Infantry Regiment, the men did not harm their {{officers}} but simply refused to return to the trenches. Most mutineers were veterans who did not refuse to fight but wanted the military authorities to be more attentive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> modern war. The soldiers had come to believe that the attacks they were ordered to make were futile. Moreover, news on the February Revolution in Russia was being published in French socialist newspapers, and anonymous pacifist propaganda leaflets were very widely distributed.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached his}} career high {{point in the}} latter half of the 1960s. In {{creating}} La filosofía y la ciencia (Philosophy and Science) at the Salvador Allende auditorium in the University of Guadalajara, he sought to bring attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> poverty, social injustice, discrimination and consequences of industrialism and technology. Los Niños Héroes, painted in Chapultepec Castle in 1967, honors the child heroes who died in the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican-American War. The mural depicts a Mexican military cadet jumping from the tower of Chapultepec Castle in 1847 wrapped in the Mexican flag in order to prevent its capture by the U.S. military forces. As a presentation to tequila, one of Jalisco's largest exports, he accepted a request to paint Tahona y fiesta and Mitología e historia del tequila for Casa Sauza, a liquor factory in Tequila, Jalisco.|$|E

25|$|Defeat. Long term Zulu success {{against a}} major world power however was a {{questionable}} proposition. Even in the victory at Isandhlwana the Zulu had taken heavy losses, and {{the efficacy of}} spears and a few untrained gunmen against modern rifles, machine guns and artillery of a major nation was ultimately limited. In his earlier encounters with European visitors to his kingdom, the Zulu King Shaka had dismissed firearms as ineffective against the massed charge of the regiments. At Isandhlawana, the monarch's boast held true. But as the Zulu War went on, massed rifle and artillery fire repeatedly broke the back of Zulu attacks, as they persisted in assaulting heavily fortified positions and failed to use captured firearms effectively. Despite earlier defeats by the Boers using guns, 4 decades earlier, the Zulu had not sufficiently adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> firepower on the battlefield,. They also failed to effectively cut the vulnerable supply lines of their enemies- leaving the Natal rear area virtually untouched for example.|$|E
25|$|During {{most of the}} 1850s, {{the young}} Vasile Alexandrescu was in France, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} in Paris, where he received his Baccalauréat (1856), and trained for a Licence ès Lettres degree. Urechia frequented exiles from both Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), growing close to the Wallachian politico C. A. Rosetti. Having written his debut literary works, some grouped in 1854 under the title Mozaic de novele, cugetări, piese şi poezii ("A Mosaic of Novellas, Musings, Plays and Poetry"), he also completed a debut novel, Coliba Măriucăi ("Măriuca's Cabin", in 1855). The plot was loosely based on Uncle Tom's Cabin, by the American abolitionist writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, and was adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> Romani slavery in Moldavia. He was at the time collaborating on Steaua Dunării, a unionist magazine co-edited by the Moldavian intellectuals Mihail Kogălniceanu and Vasile Alecsandri, where he published a Romanian-language translation of Canción a las ruinas de Itálica ("Song to the Ruins of Italica"), a Spanish Renaissance poem written by Rodrigo Caro, but attributed by scholars of the day to Fernando de Rioja.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{leadership of the}} British Army during the World War I was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> trench warfare, ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ('lions led by donkeys'). However, during the 1960s historians such as John Terraine began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years as new documents have come forth and {{the passage of time}} has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as Gary D. Sheffield and Richard Holmes observe that the {{military leadership}} of the British Army on the Western Front had to cope with many problems that they could not control such as a lack of adequate military communications, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war culminating in the Hundred Days Offensive advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.|$|E

In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions, was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.

In September 1914, Stritt wrote to Catt in America with [...] "deep personal regret" [...] for the [...] "terrible war". The pacifist women of Germany were forced by war to withdraw their invitation to host the annual IWSA congress which {{was to have been}} held nine months later in Berlin. In December 1914, Canadian Julia Grace Wales, a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, published her views about working toward a mediated peace in a pamphlet entitled [...] "Continuous Mediation Without Armistice", popularly known as the Wisconsin Plan. Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, rather than holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in The Hague for four days beginning 28 April 1915.|$|E
