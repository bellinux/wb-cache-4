25|$|Following {{the same}} tone as the French debate, {{much of the}} {{discussion}} revolved around {{the economy and the}} environment. The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar to <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>and</b> Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

500|$|Described as a [...] "caustic right-wing bully", an [...] "arch-conservative blowhard", {{and by his}} {{creator and}} namesake as a [...] "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high status idiot", Colbert is egomaniacal, xenophobic and {{fiercely}} anti-intellectual.

Colbert emphasizes that his character is genuinely well-meaning and wants {{to do the right}} thing, but does not have the tools to achieve it [...] "because he has no curiosity, he doesn't like to read and he won't listen to anybody except the voices in his head".|$|E
500|$|In January 2004, O'Keefe said {{he would}} review his {{decision}} to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA {{to look for a}} way to save it. The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged [...] "NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope". In August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. These plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as [...] "not feasible". In late 2004, several Congressional members, led by Senator Barbara Mikulski, held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the country) to get <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the International Affairs journal, Michael T. Boyle of the Australian National University {{reviewed}} Hegemony or Survival alongside Immanuel Wallerstein's The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World (2003), considering both to be [...] "well-considered if imperfect arguments" [...] {{that the}} Bush administration's foreign policy was {{in keeping with}} a long history of U.S. interference in global affairs. Praising its [...] "prescient" [...] appearance and its analysis of the historical evidence, Boyle did present some criticism of the book. In stressing the Bush administration's continuity with earlier presidencies, Boyle argued that Chomsky had neglected to highlight the differences between <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> its predecessors, in particular its willingness to break relationships with long-standing allies. Furthermore, Boyle opined that Chomsky had failed to offer a [...] "compelling explanation" [...] for why the U.S. government was willing to declare war on Iraq in 2003, a conflict that was far costlier and riskier than the 1980s military adventures in Nicaragua and Grenada.|$|E

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman lived {{close to}} the World Trade Center site, which was known as [...] "Ground Zero" [...] after the September 11 attacks that {{destroyed}} the World Trade Center. [...] Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja's school, where Spiegelman's anxiety served only to increase his daughter's apprehensiveness over the situation. [...] Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of The New Yorker which at first glance appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. [...] Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower's antenna breaks into the [...] "W" [...] of The New Yorkers logo. [...] The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four-color printing inks with an overprinted clear varnish. [...] In some situations, the ghost images only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source.
