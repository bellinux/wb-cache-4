50|$|Ive {{always said}} {{throughout}} my political career <b>that</b> if <b>youre</b> in public office, {{you should not}} hire your relatives. This is not appropriate. And it leads to the perception that government is only for friends and family. And thats neither good nor right.|$|R
60|$|MRS KNOX. Well, I {{will say}} for you, Mr Gilbey, <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> {{better than my}} man here. Hes a bitter hard heathen, is my Jo, God help me! [She begins to cry quietly].|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. So I say. It's {{really a}} great {{encouragement}} to me to find you agree with me. For of course if nobody agrees with you, how are you to know <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> not a fool? ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR PATRICK. Put {{down your}} foolish pencil, man; {{and think of}} your position. You can defy the laws made by men; {{but there are other}} laws to reckon with. Do you know <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> going to die? ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is about}} knowing {{the end result}} of every {{situation}} youre in, and being able to play it out in your mind and see it before it happens.

6000|$|KNOX. [angrily] And {{is a man}} {{never to}} {{have a bit of}} fun? See whats come of it with your daughter! She was to be content with your {{happiness}} <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> always talking about; and how did the spirit guide her? To a month's hard for being drunk and assaulting the police. Did I ever assault the police? ...|$|E
60|$|TROTTER. I cant {{possibly}} {{tell you}} what I shall say to your father about the play until Ive seen the play. But I'll {{tell you what}} I shall say to him about you. I shall say <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> a very foolish young lady; that youve got into a very questionable set; and that the sooner he takes you away from Cambridge and its Fabian Society, the better.|$|E
60|$|LEO. Youre not: youre {{a disgrace}}. You never {{consider}} <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> {{a disgrace to}} me: you think only of yourself. You must come home with me and be taken proper care of: my conscience will not allow me to let you live like a pig. [She arranges his necktie]. You must stay with me until I marry St John; {{and then we can}} adopt you or something.|$|E
5000|$|For example some {{dialogue}} from [...] "Drive" [...] TORRES: How {{come you}} {{never talked to}} me about this before? PARIS: Well, youve got that tough Klingon exterior.

PARIS: Exactly what kind of mush are we talking about? TORRES: You tell me. PARIS: Well, theres, um, kissy stuff.|$|R
60|$|ACIS. Here! <b>Thats</b> it. Now <b>youre</b> {{clean and}} decent. Up with you! Oopsh! [He hauls {{her to her}} feet. She cannot walk at first, but masters it after a few steps]. Now then: march. Here she is, Ancient: put her through the catechism.|$|R
60|$|FANNY. Yes, Mr Trotter: Ive seen a {{good deal}} of life since I came to England; and I assure you <b>that</b> to me <b>youre</b> a mere baby: a dear, good, well-meaning, delightful, witty, charming baby; but still just a wee lamb in a world of wolves. Cambridge is not what it was in my father's time.|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. Oh bigamy! bigamy! bigamy! What {{a fascination}} {{anything}} {{connected with the}} police has for you all, you moralists! Ive proved {{to you that you}} were utterly wrong on the moral point: now I'm going to shew you <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> utterly wrong on the legal point; and I hope it will be a lesson to you not to be so jolly cocksure next time.|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. [rising {{and facing}} him] Come, now, as man to man! It's {{not my fault}} <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> poorer than I am; and it's not your fault that I'm richer than you. And if you could undo all that passed between me and your mother, you wouldnt undo it; and neither would she. But youre sick of your slavery; {{and you want to}} be the hero of a romance and to get into the papers. Eh? A son revenges his mother's shame. Villain weltering in his gore. Mother: look down from heaven and receive your unhappy son's last sigh.|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Good. Well, do {{you like}} me? Dont {{misunderstand}} me: I'm perfectly aware <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> not going {{to fall in love}} at first sight with a ridiculous old shopkeeper. I cant help that ridiculous old shopkeeper. I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or not. I have to pay for his clothes, though I hate the cut of them: especially the waistcoat. I have to look at him in the glass while I'm shaving. I loathe him because hes a living lie. My soul's not like that: it's like yours. I want to make a fool of myself. About you. Will you let me? ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Kristin Garrett of Christianity Today, Garrett {{brought up}} a unique aspect in <b>that</b> The House <b>Youre</b> Build by Assad as being a [...] "confessional; her lyrics are both {{accessible}} and intimate, universal to the Christian walk, and unique to twentysomething struggles."

5000|$|The plot foiled, Enterprise {{heads off}} to its next assignmentâ€”although Riker remains uneasy when he {{encounters}} Troi and Ro intensely conversing in the Ten Forward bar. Ro insists somewhat facetiously {{that they have}} a memory they will both treasure; Troi concludes that such actions tend to result from subconscious desires. When Riker concedes confusion, she curtly informs him <b>that</b> [...] "if <b>youre</b> still confused tomorrow, you know where my office is." ...|$|R
5000|$|The leftist website Motkraft {{described}} {{the views of}} the group as follows: We have already made our choices! At workplaces, at school, and amongst unemployed the class struggle is ever present, invisible and faceless. These struggles are the Invisible Party. Every time you refuse to obey your boss, or cheat on an exam, or screw <b>that</b> job application-course, <b>youre</b> not alone. Youre part of the Invisible Party, the actual movement that undermines capitalism.|$|R
6000|$|MRS WARREN. I mean <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> {{throwing}} away all your chances for nothing. You {{think that people}} are what they pretend to be: that the way you were taught at school and college to think right and proper is the way things really are. But it's not: it's all only a pretence, to keep the cowardly slavish common run of people quiet. Do you want to find that out, like other women, at forty, when you've thrown yourself away and lost your chances; or won't you take it in good time now from your own mother, that loves you and swears to you that it's truth: gospel truth? [Urgently] Vivie: the big people, the clever people, the managing people, all know it. They do as I do, and think what I think. I know plenty of them. I know them to speak to, to introduce you to, to make friends of for you. I don't mean anything wrong: thats what you don't understand: your head is full of ignorant ideas about me. What do the people that taught you know about life or about people like me? When did they ever meet me, or speak to me, or let anyone tell them about me? the fools! Would they ever have done anything for you if I hadn't paid them? Havn't I told you that I want you to be respectable? Havn't I brought you up to be respectable? And how can you keep it up without my money and my influence and Lizzie's friends? Can't you see <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> cutting your own throat as well as breaking my heart in turning your back on me? ...|$|E
60|$|BLANCO [Forcibly] No: {{thats where}} youre wrong. Dont flatter yourselves <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> miserable sinners. Am I a miserable sinner? No: I'm a fraud and a failure. I started {{in to be}} a bad man like the rest of you. You all started in to be bad men or you wouldn't be in this jumped-up, jerked-off, hospital-turned-out camp that calls itself a town. I took the broad path because I thought I was a man and not a snivelling canting turning-the-other-cheek {{apprentice}} angel serving his time in a vale of tears. They talked Christianity to us on Sundays; but when they really meant business they told us never to take a blow without giving it back, and to get dollars. When they talked the golden rule to me, I just looked at them as if they werent there, and spat. But when they told me to try to live my life so that I could always look my fellowman straight in the eye and tell him to go to hell, that fetched me.|$|E
60|$|BLANCO. What do {{you know}} about Him? you that always talk as if He never did {{anything}} without asking your rotten leave first? Why did the child die? Tell me that if you can. He cant have wanted to kill the child. Why did He make me go soft on the child if He was going hard on it Himself? Why should He go hard on the innocent kid and go soft on a rotten thing like me? Why did I go soft myself? Why did the Sheriff go soft? Why did Feemy go soft? Whats this game that upsets our game? For seems to me theres two games bein played. Our game is a rotten game that makes me feel I'm dirt and <b>that</b> <b>youre</b> all as rotten dirt as me. T'other game may be a silly game; but it aint rotten. When the Sheriff played it he stopped being rotten. When Feemy played it the paint nearly dropped off her face. When I played it I cursed myself for a fool; but I lost the rotten feel all the same.|$|E
5000|$|The Clancy Brothers mother read news of {{the terrible}} ice and snow storms in New York City and sent Aran sweaters for her sons and Tommy Makem to keep them warm. They wore the sweaters {{for the first time}} at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan, simply as part of their regular winter clothes. When the groups manager Marty Erlichman, who had been searching for a special [...] "look" [...] for the group, saw the sweaters, he exclaimed, [...] "Thats it! Thats it! <b>Thats</b> what <b>youre</b> going to wear." [...] Ehrlichman {{requested}} that the group wear the sweaters on their upcoming television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After they did, the sales of Aran sweaters rose by 700% according to Liam Clancy, and they soon became the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makems trademark costume.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{clash between}} Roberts and {{physicist}} Brian Cox on the live television talk show Q&A on ABC TV broadcast 15 August 2016, Roberts claimed that engineer and blogger Steven Goddard (a pseudonym of Tony Heller) had shown the NASA temperature data for the 1930s were [...] "warmer than recent decades". In The Guardians assessment, Roberts was referring to a debunked conspiracy theory that claimed 1934 was hotter than 1998. Cox then asked if NASA, the Australian Academy of Science, and the Met Office in the UK were all collaborating to manipulate global temperature data, to which Roberts {{asked if he was}} being accused of claiming they were all collaborating, to which Cox responded: [...] "What, theyve all manipulated it in the same way and accidentally got to the same answer? Is <b>that</b> what <b>youre</b> saying?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Next, a balding, mustachioed pitchman {{presents}} a fast-talking spiel <b>that</b> if <b>youre</b> bothered by [...] "dandruff, athletes foot {{and the common}} cold, cancer, birth defects, mental illness, ringworm, poison ivy, tooth decay, acne, measles, brain tumor, smallpox, syphilis, plague, influenza, hepatitis and St. Vitus Dance, well, youre in luck, friend. Pick a pack of Peters perfidious pink pacifying placebo pills..." [...] At that point Jackie Gleason, Carol Channing and Arnold Stang are shown {{sitting in front of}} the TV, with Gleason and Channing at war, each with a remote control and switching channels. Gleason and Stang subsequently go to the kitchen and, as they come out, the TV screen shows combative 1960s TV personality Joe Pyne commenting on the hearings: [...] "...and, as one witness follows another, Senator Hummel is getting the same answer Senator Kefauver got in 1950 and 1951..." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHNNY [rising vengefully and {{following}} Bentley, who {{is forced to}} turn and listen] I'll {{tell you what it}} is, my boy: you want a good talking to; and I'm {{going to give it to}} you. If you think that because your father's a K.C.B., and you want to marry my sister, you can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like, youre mistaken. Let me tell you that except Hypatia, not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you; and I dont believe shes happy about it herself. The match isnt settled yet: dont forget <b>that.</b> <b>Youre</b> on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her. Youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him. Thats been going on for two months now; and whats the result? Youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the office; and youre getting yourself thoroughly disliked here, all through your bad manners and your conceit, and the damned impudence you think clever.|$|E

[...] "Dirty Eyes" [...] features a different chord progression in the chorus and does not contain the [...] "band duel" [...] featured in [...] "Rosie." [...] In AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, Malcolm Young is quoted, [...] "We were always big fans of early rock and roll, like Elvis and Heartbreak Hotel, things like that - the stop-and-start things, the dynamics. If anything, for Whole Lotta Rosie {{we were looking for}} a feel like Little Richard, a good steamin rock feel, and see what we could lay on top with the guitars. It evoked <b>that,</b> but <b>youre</b> just looking for the vibe, whats exciting, and thats what we were listening to. Simple to put together, but still around like a classic." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN. But {{you don't}} know all <b>that</b> <b>that</b> means; <b>youre</b> too young. It means {{a new dress}} every day; it means theatres and balls every night; it means having the pick of all the gentlemen in Europe at your feet; it means a lovely house and plenty of servants; it means the choicest of eating and drinking; it means {{everything}} you like, everything you want, everything you can think of. And what are you here? A mere drudge, toiling and moiling early and late for your bare living and two cheap dresses a year. Think over it. [Soothingly] Youre shocked, I know. I can enter into your feelings; and I think they do you credit; but trust me, nobody will blame you: you may {{take my word for}} that.
