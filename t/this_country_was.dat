But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

But I must take the credit away, since I know better.

And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.|$|E

An opponent of the Act, Conservative MP Ian Gilmour, asserted that it was [...] "brought in to keep the blacks out.
