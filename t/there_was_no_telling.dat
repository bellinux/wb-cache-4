2500|$|Some delegates were {{reluctant}} to expand into any so [...] "remote wilderness". It would retard the commercial development of the east. They would be easily influenced, [...] "foreign gold" [...] would corrupt them. Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for perpetual provinces. There were so many foreigners moving out west, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> how things would turn out. These were poor people, they could not {{pay their fair share}} of taxes. It would be [...] "suicide" [...] for the original states. New states could become a majority in the Senate, they would abuse their power, [...] "enslaving" [...] the original thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for the Mississippi River. As time wore on, any war for the Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the 1812 American victory at New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|It was reported, however, {{that the}} rescue {{operation}} was [...] "chaotic". BBC journalist Zeesha Zafar reported that [...] "there were fewer rescue workers there than {{one would have}} expected. A majority of them {{were members of the}} anti-terrorism police. Most of them just stood around, gazing at the burning debris, and looking as though there was not much that they could do." [...] He stated that a police officer threatened to baton charge rescuers if they did not [...] "move quickly". Zafar reported that [...] "just when the rescuers were shuffling to get to work, a policeman in plain clothes announced that an army helicopter was coming in to pour water on the fire, and that everyone should get out of the way. The work stopped. The helicopter came, circled on the spot a couple of times, and went away. No water." [...] Zafar went on that it [...] "was distinctly obvious that there was no co-ordination between the workers of different departments such as the police, the rescue department, the Capital Development Authority and the military ... Rescuers operated in a chaotic manner, scouring through the debris that was not on fire ... During the two hours that I stayed at the scene, I saw rescuers collect three separate loads of body parts which they tied up in shrouds. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> how many people they belonged to." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I may," [...] Julian {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "The instinct of the sleuthhound {{is beginning}} to stir in me. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> how far it may lead." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{was after}} the deer. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> {{what he might have}} done. I am glad he is dead. Phil, it was lucky you heard the beast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] {{returned}} the younger lad. [...] "But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> {{when they will}} be back. Still I reckon we had {{better get out of}} here." ...|$|R
60|$|What to do {{next the}} boys did not know. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> {{what had become of}} the strange {{occupant}} of the lonely cabin, or when he would return.|$|E
60|$|What the Rube {{might have}} done <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling,</b> but as he grasped a curtain, he was {{interrupted}} by a shriek from some woman assuredly not of our party.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, we didn't catch him, {{and nobody}} is hurt," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Laning. [...] "We lost him in the swamp, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> where he <b>is</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, and it's one comfort. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> {{when they}} reach civilization again. Why, this forest is about as bad as some places in the far West." ...|$|R
