5|$|On 30December, the JTWC {{reported}} that Rewa had become {{equivalent to a}} category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early {{the next day the}} BoM {{reported that}} the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.|$|E
500|$|Early on November 15, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that Vania {{had become a}} category two tropical cyclone with peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of between , while the JTWC reported peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 110km/h (70mph) which made it equivalent to a tropical storm. Later that day Vania passed near or over several of the Vanuatuan islands as it continued to move towards the south— southwest, and started to weaken as it encountered a higher amount of vertical windshear. During the following day, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} Vania had weakened into a category one tropical cyclone as the systems low level circulation stalled, before it <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to move westwards while located {{to the north of}} New Caledonia. During November 17, as the system had become sheared the JTWC issued their final advisory on Vania, before the systems remnant low level circulation was last noted by TCWC Nadi and the JTWC during November 19, while it was located about [...] to the west of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Only minor damage to crops and bush houses was reported to have occurred in the archipelago while no deaths were reported. As a result of Vania affecting parts of Vanuatu during November 15, voting in provincial elections had to be extended by 24 hours.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands, and became the first major {{tropical}} cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983. During December 12, Wasa passed through the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed directly over Tubuai. Later that day, the FMS reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression, before the NWOC issued their final advisory on Wasa during December 13. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, in particular within the systems southeastern quadrant, the system subsequently <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to move towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotus. the FMS subsequently reported during December 14, that the system had regenerated into a category one tropical cyclone and renamed it: Arthur, for various reasons including operational purposes and to avoid confusion among recipients of their warnings. During that day the system gradually intensified further, as it passed about [...] to the north-northwest of the atoll: Mururoa, with the automatic weather station there reporting sustained wind speeds of 70km/h (45mph). At 12:00UTC, the FMS reported that Wasa–Arthur had re-peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of , which made it a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. During the next day the system maintained its peak intensity and moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands and several other atolls, before as Wasa-Arthur turned eastwards, the NWOC decided to classify the storm as Tropical Cyclone 08P, with peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of [...] During December 16, the system started to gradually weaken as it turned more towards the east, before it degenerated into a shallow depression late the next day. The remnant depression was last noted dissipating during December 18, {{to the north of the}} Pitcairn islands.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January, the {{submarine}} made radar contact from [...] {{on a large}} convoy with six escorts and well covered by aircraft. As she closed, the moon came out bright and clear. An enemy bomber <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> in as radar picked up another plane coming in astern at [...] The submarine went deep, and the convoy slowly pulled away. The next day, the ship was ordered to terminate her patrol, and she returned to Guam on 3 February.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, 1863, Custer and the First and Seventh Michigan Cavalry {{had just}} passed through Hanover, Pennsylvania, while the Fifth and Sixth Michigan Cavalry {{followed}} about seven miles behind. Hearing gunfire, he <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> {{to the sound}} of the guns. A courier reported that Farnsworth's Brigade had been attacked by rebel cavalry from side streets in the town. Reassembling his command, he received orders from Kilpatrick to engage the enemy northeast of town near the railway station. Custer deployed his troops and began to advance. After a brief firefight, the rebels withdrew to the northeast. This seemed odd, since it was supposed that Lee and his army were somewhere to the west. Though seemingly of little consequence, this skirmish further delayed Stuart from joining Lee. Further, as Captain James H. Kidd, commander of F troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, later wrote: [...] "Under [...] skillful hand the four regiments were soon welded into a cohesive unit...." ...|$|E

60|$|She <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> <b>started</b> with {{surprise}} very well imitated. 'I didn't see you was there!' she said.|$|R

60|$|He <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> at once and, {{as he did}} so, a {{dropping}} {{fire from}} matchlocks and guns was opened upon them.

60|$|He {{might well}} have failed to see my hand. At any rate {{he did not take}} it. He <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to walk out of the woods by my side.

60|$|But he didn't seize my throat. Nothing happened. And, since nature abhors a status, I {{could not}} remain {{there in the}} one place forever paralysed.

The pursuit, with a ghost, was the swiftness of thought. And there were ghosts. I had seen one.|$|E
