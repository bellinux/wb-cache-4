It was equipped with automatic signalling using <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> and pneumatic semaphore signals, and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town).|$|E
25|$|<b>Track</b> <b>circuits</b> {{can detect}} some {{but not all}} broken rails. Broken rails in {{switches}} may be in parallel paths, which cannot be detected. Breaks that are not clean breaks {{from top to bottom}} of the rail also cannot be detected. Wiring at the start and finish of <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> are connected a short distance {{from the end of the}} rails, so that there is a blind spot within which broken rails are not detected.|$|E

The primary {{parameter}} of the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is often}} the test data in {{the maintenance of the}} signal, is the important basis for designing equipment of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and is the basic parameter of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> parameter, primary parameter of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> can be used for rail simulation experiment of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> parameters, analysis of rail leakage and calculation of <b>track</b> <b>circuit.</b> This paper studies the primary parameter of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> test method, the result can be used for calculation <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> parameter. In the practical application, primary parameter of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> test can have positive significance in the division of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> district and the adjustment of working state...|$|R
50|$|A <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{interrupter}} may {{be fitted}} at catch points, trap points or buffer stops {{to maintain a}} <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> in the 'occupied' state {{in the event of}} a derailment. The <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> remains de-energised until the interrupter is replaced.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{approaches}} {{to provide a}} continuous path for traction current that spans multiple <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks. The simplest method installs insulated <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> joints on {{only one of the}} two rails with the second being a path for the return current and a ground for the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> rail. This has the disadvantage of only being able to detect breaks in one rail so the more popular two rail system uses impedance bonds to permit traction current to pass between isolated <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks while blocking current at <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> frequencies.|$|R
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the axle counter, which {{can reduce the}} number of <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> and thus the number of insulated rail joints required.|$|E
25|$|Some AWD <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{equipped}} with motion detectors that deactivate the crossing signal if the train stops or slows significantly before arriving at the crossing.|$|E
25|$|The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received axle counters instead of <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> in 2012.|$|E

50|$|If {{the lines}} are <b>track</b> <b>circuited</b> and a wagon or train using the catchpoint could foul an {{adjacent}} line, then a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupter will be fitted {{to one of the}} run-off rails. When a train runs off it will break the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and set main line signals to 'danger'.|$|R
25|$|Since that time, {{training}} {{and procedures for}} signal electricians have been strengthened and it is clearly stated in railway rules that {{in the event of}} a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> failure, no attempt shall be made to clear any of the signals controlled by the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> by manipulation of the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> relay...|$|R
25|$|Where <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> {{exist for}} {{signalling}} purposes, insulated block joints are required. These compound {{the weaknesses of}} ordinary joints. Specially-made glued joints, where all the gaps are filled with epoxy resin, increase the strength again.|$|E
25|$|Høn became unstaffed on 1 January 1971. The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received axle counters instead of <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{advantage}} of the fourth-rail system is that, in tunnels with a metallic (usually cast-iron) lining, the return traction current does not leak into the lining causing electrolytic corrosion there or in the neighbouring utility mains. The two running rails are available exclusively for <b>track</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|E

Intercity railway {{communication and}} control systems often work in sensitive status, because they adopt microelectronics and computer systems. The geomagnetic storms will easily affect the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and signal equipment [14]. Therefore, the new problem that geomagnetic storms interfere with the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> is worth studied.|$|R

In {{order to}} better {{research}} and design <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> system, this paper analysis and calculated compensation capacitor of the ZPW 2000 no insulation <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> and verified {{the consistency of the}} experimental results and the practical installation situation. Analysis results also show that, through the appropriate compensation capacitor, the no insulation <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> transmission distance significantly increased...|$|R
25|$|Some level {{crossings}} that are located close to intersections with traffic lights program the signals with a preemption sequence {{so when the}} approaching train trips the track circuit, it not only activates the crossing signals, but also changes the traffic lights facing the crossing to green, to clear any traffic that may be queued on the crossing. If the intersection's stop line is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing's stop line), the <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> would change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase). Some <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> place the signals into flash mode the entire time the AWDs are active. In cases where railroads share {{the right of way}} with vehicular traffic, simple railroad preemption may cause an all-red flash in traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{accelerated the}} introduction of British Railways' Automatic Warning System (AWS), although some in the industry thought more lives would be saved by spending the money on installing more <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> and colour light signals. By 1977 a third of British Rail track had been fitted with AWS.|$|E
25|$|LZB {{consists}} of equipment {{on the line}} {{as well as on}} the trains. A 30–40km segment of track is controlled by a LZB control center. The control center computer receives information about occupied blocks from <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> or axle counters and locked routes from interlockings. It is programmed with the track configuration including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed and at what speed.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupters were {{directly}} connected to the rail, both physically and electrically. One of the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> tail cables would {{be connected to the}} interrupter, it being connected to the rail. If the interrupter was broken, it was possible that the broken part, with cable still attached, could drop onto the rail and allow the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> to remain energised and show 'clear'. To overcome this, it is now practice for <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupters to be insulated from the rail to which they are attached. A <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> cable is taken via the interrupter, with one end connected to the upper part of it and another end to the lower part. The cable is at opposite polarity to the rail, therefore should the broken part of the interrupter drop onto the rail, the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> will be short circuited and show 'occupied'.|$|R

25|$|Electrification cost: {{electrification}} {{requires an}} entire new infrastructure {{to be built}} around the existing tracks at a significant cost. Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other obstructions have to be altered for clearance. Another aspect that can raise the cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to railway signalling needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> from interference by traction current. Electrification may require line closures while the new equipment is being installed.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1920s, the PRR {{installed}} Pulse code cab signaling along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using <b>track</b> <b>circuits,</b> {{was picked up by}} a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the engineer's cab. PRR ultimately installed cab signals on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). PRR also experimented with cab signals without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). Cab signals were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded {{track circuit}} technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E
40|$|Frequency-shift keying audio {{jointless}} <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is used in}} high-speed railway in China. However, {{within the}} station, <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> with mechanical insulation is applied. In complex circuit network of electrified railway station, impedance match bond is designed to ensure the normal operation of the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{and the protection of}} strong traction current interference. As a combination of strong and weak electricity components of <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> impedance match bond is both the part of the loop of the traction current and the part of the transmission line of <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> playing a very critical role in the electrified railway. The structure of impedance match bond is more complex than traditional impedance transformer, including the transformer with larger air-gap, LC resonance circuit for power frequency filtering, and components to enhance the signal frequency. Modeling on impedance match bond and study about the four-terminal network parameters of impedance match bond are in favor of the following two aspects: modeling of the overall traction current and calculation of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> working condition. By applying the transformer equivalent circuit model and combination of testing and calculation, the accurate model of impedance match bond is constructed and verified. Finally, for ease of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> calculation, four-terminal network model of impedance match bond under different signal carrier frequencies is presented...|$|R
50|$|Trap {{points or}} catch points are {{designed}} to intentionally derail vehicles making an unauthorised movement. When a vehicle derails completely, its wheels cease to shunt the <b>track</b> <b>circuit.</b> Since the vehicle might still be foul of the track, {{it is important to}} maintain the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> in the 'occupied' state. To achieve this, a cast iron interrupter is fitted to one of the run-off rails such that it will be struck by the wheels of a vehicle that is about to be derailed. Since the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> is bonded via the interrupter, it is proved to be intact when the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> relay is energised.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} study, two safety rules {{are to be}} proved by B method tools: There cannot be two trains on the same <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and there must always be a free <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> between two trains.|$|R
25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E
25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including switch (point) control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail <b>track</b> <b>circuits.</b> (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E
500|$|The BS used a Westinghouse {{automatic}} signalling system operated through electric <b>track</b> <b>circuits.</b> This controlled signals {{based on the}} presence or absence of a train on the track ahead. Signals incorporated an arm that was raised when the signal was red. If a train failed to stop at a red signal, the arm activated a [...] "tripcock" [...] on the train, applying the brakes automatically.|$|E
5000|$|... the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> can {{be split}} with extra blockjoints and the {{detectors}} in the points complete the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> when the points are normal and the signal {{is entitled to}} receive a green light. This is partially fail-safe.|$|R
50|$|In some railway {{electrification}} schemes, {{one or both}} of the running rails are used to carry the return current. This prevents use of the basic DC <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> because the substantial traction currents overwhelm the very small <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> currents.|$|R
30|$|Geomagnetic storms {{can cause}} earth surface {{potentials}} (ESPs) in the ground. ESP produces geomagnetically induced current (GIC) in a loop {{which is made}} up by rails and ground. If GIC flows into intercity railway <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> it will threaten the normal operation of <b>track</b> <b>circuit.</b> The reason that geomagnetic storms invade the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> was analyzed, and then how GIC affects the characteristics of choke transformers, was found. The calculation method of GIC according to a simulation based on the GIC flow path in the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> was built. Electromagnetic system model of choke transformer and track relay were designed in Maxwell software to get the magnetic flux density distribution of them. The results show that GIC values of 2.4 A can bring about serious direct current bias of choke transformers and cause the terminal voltage of track relay to decrease, resulting in relay malfunction. The numerical calculation results show that geomagnetic storms will interfere with intercity railway <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> which is in accordance with some phenomenon happened in some rail tracks. This method proves geomagnetic storms’ influence on intercity railway <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and attentions should be paid to this influence.|$|R
