40|$|This paper proposes an optimum {{methodology}} for assigning supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> to modules in a CMOS circuit {{such that the}} overall energy consumption is minimized for a given delay constraint. The modules of the circuit should have large enough gate depths such that the delay and energy penalties of the level shifters connecting them are negligible. Both static and dynamic energy are considered in the optimization. Energy savings of up to 48 % have been achieved on various example circuits. The {{first step in the}} optimization finds optimum supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> for each module in the circuit. If the circuit has a large number of modules, this step might yield a correspondingly large number of different supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> for minimum energy consumption. Since having a large number of different supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> on an IC is not feasible in current technologies, an additional step clusters the multiple voltages obtained from the first step into a fixed number of supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> (for example, 2 different supply voltages and 2 different <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages).</b> In addition to the application of this method to circuit optimization, it can also be applied {{to a wide range of}} problems with delay constraints, such as software tasks running on a dynamically variable VDD and Vth processor. 1...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of a P-MOS, the body is {{connected}} to the most positive voltage, and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on. The P-MOS switch passes all voltages higher than Vgate–Vtp (<b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> Vtp is negative in {{the case of}} enhancement-mode P-MOS).|$|E
25|$|The {{subthreshold}} I–V curve depends exponentially upon <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{introducing a}} strong dependence on any manufacturing variation that affects threshold voltage; for example: variations in oxide thickness, junction depth, or body doping {{that change the}} degree of drain-induced barrier lowering. The resulting sensitivity to fabricational variations complicates optimization for leakage and performance.|$|E
25|$|The drain induced barrier {{lowering}} of the <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> and channel length modulation effects upon I-V curves are reduced by using shallow junction extensions. In addition, halo doping can be used, that is, {{the addition of}} very thin heavily doped regions of the same doping type as the body tight against the junction walls to limit the extent of depletion regions.|$|E
40|$|Assigning {{gate supply}} <b>voltage</b> and {{transistor}} <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> {{to a range}} of discrete values is a combinatorial problem. The optimization computational difficulty grows exponentially with the netlist size. Whereas, if the range of values is continuous, we show that the global optimum can be found in polynomial time. We show that posynomials can model variable supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages,</b> with skewed gate drive strengths. The models have root mean square (RMS) errors of 10 % or less compared to 0. 13 um SPICE data. With these models, geometric programming gives a convex problem formulation with globally optimal solutions for minimum delay, energy×delay, or power. For the examples considered, dual voltage and continuous voltage solutions reduce power by up to 22 % compared to the optimal solution using single supply and <b>thresholds</b> <b>voltages.</b> 1...|$|R

25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage,</b> the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|E

Using the Laplace transform, a set of non-linear equations describing the memristors dynamics is solved exactly, without any approximations. The time dependencies of memristances are found and it is shown that the voltage falls across memristors are proportional to their <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages.</b> A compact expression for the network switching time is derived...|$|R

25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT roll-off. VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E
25|$|In an {{n-channel}} 'enhancement-mode' device, a {{conductive channel}} {{does not exist}} naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added {{to the body of}} the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a depletion region, and the voltage at which this occurs {{is referred to as the}} <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called inversion.|$|E
25|$|Polysilicon {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E

25|$|The <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> (and {{consequently}} the drain to source on-current) is modified {{by the work}} function difference between the gate material and channel material. Because polysilicon is a semiconductor, its work function can be modulated by adjusting the type and level of doping. Furthermore, because polysilicon has the same bandgap as the underlying silicon channel, it is quite straightforward to tune the work function to achieve low threshold voltages for both NMOS and PMOS devices. By contrast, the work functions of metals are not easily modulated, so tuning the work function to obtain low threshold voltages becomes a significant challenge. Additionally, obtaining low-threshold devices on both PMOS and NMOS devices sometimes {{requires the use of}} different metals for each device type. While bimetallic integrated circuits (i.e., one type of metal for gate electrodes of NFETS and a second type of metal for gate electrodes of PFETS) are not common, they are known in patent literature and provide some benefit in terms of tuning electrical circuits' overall electrical performance.|$|E
