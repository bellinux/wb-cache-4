5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{some of the}} Cambridge Platonists {{approached}} hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (the Younger, 1617–1688), {{through their}} reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, {{came to see the}} divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism. i.e. materialism and hylozoism.|$|E
25|$|The true {{human is}} an incorporeal contemplative {{capacity}} of the soul, and superior <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his {{focus is on the}} greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Rolling Stone {{described}} it as a [...] "pop classic", a work that [...] "stands alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance". Most contemporary reviewers consider Living in the Material World to be a worthy successor <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, even if it inevitably falls short of Harrison's grand opus. Author Simon Leng refers to the album as a [...] "forgotten blockbuster", representing [...] "the close of an age, the last offering of the Beatles' London era". EMI reissued the album in 2006, in remastered form with bonus tracks, and released a deluxe-edition CD/DVD set that included film clips of four songs.|$|E
500|$|Mojo {{contributor}} John Harris cites [...] "Give Me Love" [...] {{as evidence}} of Material Worlds standing as [...] "something of a Hindu concept album … a pleasing fusion of Eastern religion, gospel, and the ghost of 'For You Blue'". Hugh Fielder of Classic Rock admires Harrison's [...] "painstaking craftsmanship" [...] and [...] "sublime playing" [...] on this and other Material World tracks and describes it as [...] "one of Harrison's finest songs". Writing for Uncut, David Cavanagh considers the album to be a [...] "utopian follow-up" [...] <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, on which [...] "Give Me Love" [...] "encapsulates the deal: simple message of hope, with gorgeous slide guitar … and fantastic rhythm section".|$|E
500|$|Harrison began {{recording}} his long-awaited follow-up <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass in October 1972, {{having been}} sidetracked with {{issues relating to}} the Concert for Bangladesh for over a year. The Magic Is Here Again and The Light That Has Lighted the World were each rumoured {{to be the new}} album's title until Apple Records announced it as Living in the Material World. Inglis views [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] as an ideal title track for the album, given [...] "the internal dialogue in which he was engaging at the time". Leng describes Harrison as [...] "a man positively pregnant with vision" [...] following the [...] "overwhelming success" [...] of his solo career since the Beatles' break-up, and suggests that a visit he made to India with American musician Gary Wright in early 1972 was a contributing factor.|$|E

500|$|That {{the album}} sounded so {{contemporary}} in 1970 contributed <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass seeming dated and faddish {{later in the}} decade. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, having bemoaned in 1971 that the album was characterised by [...] "overblown fatuity" [...] and uninteresting music, wrote in a 1981 review of its [...] "featurelessness", [...] "right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals". In their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler were likewise lukewarm in their assessment, criticising the [...] "homogeneity" [...] of the production and [...] "the lugubrious nature of Harrison's composing". Writing in The Beatles Forever in 1977, however, Nicholas Schaffner praised the album as the [...] "crowning glory" [...] of Harrison and Spector's careers, and highlighted [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] and [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] as the [...] "two most eloquent songs... musically as well as lyrically".|$|E
500|$|Harrison had {{intended}} to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as [...] "Who Can See It" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before, and noted an [...] "austere quality" [...] {{in some of the}} new songs. [...] "George was under stress during Living in the Material World," [...] Barham said later. [...] "I felt that he was going through some kind of a crisis. I think it may have been spiritual, but I cannot be sure." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the {{majority}} of Living in the Material World, Harrison recorded the basic track for [...] "Give Me Love" [...] in the autumn of 1972 with the assistance of former Beatles engineer Phil McDonald. The recording location was either FPSHOT, Harrison's new home studio at Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, or Apple Studio in London. In a departure from Harrison's co-productions with Spector, where a large line-up of musicians had been standard, [...] "Give Me Love" [...] featured a pared-down arrangement and more subtle instrumentation. Another contrast was Harrison's adoption of a production style that partly recalls George Martin's work with the Beatles. On [...] "Give Me Love", Inglis notes the same [...] "supple and clear [...] guitar-playing that distinguished 'Here Comes the Sun'" [...] in 1969, while the less grand production, relative <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, allowed greater expression for Harrison as a slide guitarist.|$|E

500|$|The song {{continues}} to receive attention following the 2014 Apple Years Harrison reissues. In Mojo, Tom Doyle writes of Living in the Material World [...] "spot the spirituality and the dreaminess" [...] in Harrison's songwriting, through [...] "the gentle, non-preachy 'The Light That Has Lighted the World' and 'Be Here Now', both {{great works of}} look-around-you wonder". In a review for Blogcritics, Chaz Lipp views the production on the album as [...] "meticulous" [...] and superior <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, such that [...] "he delicate melodies of songs like 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' and 'Be Here Now' are never lost in bombast." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Scot Elingburg pairs [...] "Be Here Now" [...] with [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as Material World tracks that [...] "offer {{much more than just}} Harrison's Hindu-inspired teachings; they also offer up the chance for larger dialogue within music." ...|$|E
500|$|More recently, AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer has {{described}} [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] as [...] "one {{of the more}} profound observations to be made about the somewhat schizophrenic struggle between universal existence and monetary-driven survival". Planer praises the recording as [...] "a testament to the artist's ability to deliver the goods , with searing albeit brief interaction with saxophonist Jim Horn" [...] and similarly compliments the playing of Starr and Hopkins. While opining that Material World [...] "suffers from a more anonymous tract" [...] next <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, Zeth Lundy of PopMatters pairs [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] with [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)" [...] as the album's [...] "most uptempo rock songs", which [...] "fare much better [...] as eager bids for secession from this life, or {{at least from the}} clutches of its material concerns".|$|E
500|$|The team {{began searching}} for a genre {{on which to base}} the soundtrack. They {{initially}} sought inspiration from the music of Richard Wagner, who was admired by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler. After studying Wagner's work, however, the team discovered that it didn't necessarily fit with the game's tone. They then searched for a style of music that would suit the Nazis, ultimately selecting distortion. [...] "There's lots of analogue distortion types, there's all sorts of different pedals and valves and things that are really breaking up," [...] said Gordon. They also took inspiration from 1960s music, using analogue equipment such as tape machines and reel-to-reel machines. Gordon has said that the soundtrack is [...] "a tribute <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> guitar". In collaboration with each other, the team of musicians composed over six hours of music which scores the game. Matthies said, [...] "A lot of the score features odd time signatures yet it's all very groovy." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the album's {{reception}} in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote: [...] "Harrison's worldly critics, {{who had long}} found his sermons insufferable, responded like bulls to a red flag to Extra Texture, which contains a number of treatises on how reviewers always 'miss the point.'" [...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has reminded us more than we have asked. But if he learned nothing else from his experience in that organization, it ought to have been that a good guitar player isn't worth much without a band." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue, Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp {{writes that}} [...] "this chart-topping classic is, {{in terms of}} production, arguably {{preferable}} to its predecessor", adding: [...] "The sinewy 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues,' galloping title track, and soaring 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' rank right alongside Harrison's best work." [...] Alex Franquelli of PopMatters refers to it as [...] "a worthy successor" [...] <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass and an album that [...] "raises the bar of social awareness that had only been touched on lightly in the previous release". Franquelli concludes: [...] "It is a work that enjoys a more elaborate dynamic development, where layers are kept together by Harrison’s clever work behind the mixing desk." [...] In another 2014 review, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka writes: [...] "All these years on, it's his most overtly spiritual album that sparkles today … The well-known songs, such as 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues' (dedicated to the rapacious Allen Klein), stand up well, but it's the more restrained tracks – 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long', 'Who Can See It' – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint." [...] Trynka goes on to describe [...] "Be Here Now" [...] as the album's [...] "towering achievement" [...] and [...] "a masterpiece".|$|E
