It consists of linear elastic fibers that interact in an equal load sharing scheme, complemented with a local viscoelastic relaxation mechanism.

In the <b>tertiary</b> regime <b>creep</b> rate follows the experimentally observed one over time-to-failure dependence. The time of minimum strain rate is systematically observed to be about 60 - 65 % of the time to failure, in accordance with experimental observations. In addition, burst size statistics of breaking events display a - 3 / 2 power law for events close to the time of failure, and a steeper decay for the all-time distribution.

50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary creep deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain. In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of creep strain until a critical strain is reached.|$|E

Copyright © 2016 by the American Rock Mechanics AssociationIn this study, micro-mechanisms {{that govern}} the viscous and damage {{behavior}} of salt polycrystal during creep processes are investigated. A Finite Element model is designed with POROFIS, in which surface elements represent salt grains and joint elements represent inter-granular contacts. Microscopic observations of salt thin sections serve as a basis to design the mesh, which includes voids. We compare three strategies to predict microscopic damage in the salt polycrystal: (1) inter-granular damage represented by damage propagation in joint elements; (2) intra-granular damage represented by stiffness degradation in grain surface elements; (3) damage in both surface and joint elements. We simulate creep tests in conditions typical of Compressed Air Energy Storage. The three models capture polycrystal stiffness degradation and the initiation, propagation and coalescence of cracks that originate from geometric incompatibilities and local stress concentrations. The model with damageable joints presents a more ductile behavior and captures a smooth transition between steady state and <b>tertiary</b> state <b>creep.</b> This research is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of viscous damage mechanisms in salt rock for geostorage applications, and bring new insights on numerical modeling of multi-scale damage processes in crystalline materials...|$|R

40|$|This thesis uses an energy-based {{approach}} {{to develop new}} analytical solutions for the time-dependent creep response of deeply embedded cavities. The new models developed here {{can be used for}} the initial design of tunnels and for other applications such as underground storage caverns and problems outside the field of geomechanics. The objective of using this energy-based approach is to develop models that can provide a quick estimate of cavity closure and that can be applied to different design situations and material behaviour. For the first time a three-dimensional analytical solution has been developed for the time-dependent response of a cavity embedded in a viscoelastic medium. The cavity is excavated quasi-instantaneously from an infinite body with an initial isotropic stress field. The problem is three-dimensional due to the effect of a tunnel face. This new solution can predict the full interaction between the tunnel and the surrounding creeping rock and thus can be incorporated with field monitoring data in an expert system for tunnel design. The accuracy of this model is comparable with finite element analysis. A new class of thermodynamically consistent constitutive models have been developed, which couple viscoplasticity and damage, describing both the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> stages of <b>creep</b> behaviour. Models were derived for both frictionless and frictional materials within the framework of hyperplasticity. The frictional model provided a good fit to data obtained from the triaxial compression testing of sandstone, illustrating its capability of describing creeping rock. These new constitutive models were incorporated into the energy-based method for cavity analysis, using a two-dimensional plane strain cylindrical cavity for demonstration purposes. A parametric study was carried out and results were also compared with FE analysis. Findings show that the models successfully describe the secondary and <b>tertiary</b> stages of <b>creep</b> behaviour. These new solutions only require a simple text file as an input and need minimal skill to operate. The formation of an initial geometry or finite element mesh is not necessary. This is shown through the creation of a standalone program for the three-dimensional model. The new solutions can take into account a wide range of different material behaviour, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems and due to their thermodynamic consistency are able to simulate other time-dependent processes, such as relaxation. This shows the flexibility of this approach and its applicability to different geomechanics problems...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} a peridynamic method in predicting viscoelastic creep behaviour with recovery stage and to find the suitable numerical parameters of peridynamic method. Design/methodology/approach – A rheological viscoelastic creep constitutive equation including recovery and an elastic peridynamic equation (with integral basis) are examined and used. The elasticity equation within the peridynamic equation is replaced by the viscoelastic equation. A new peridynamic method with two time parameters, i. e. numerical time and viscoelastic real time is designed. The two parameters of peridynamic method, horizon radius and number of nodes per unit volume are studied to get their optimal values. In validating this peridynamic method, comparisons are made between numerical and analytical result and between numerical and experimental data. Findings – The new peridynamic method for viscoelastic creep behaviour is approved by the good matching in numerical-analytical data comparison with difference of < 0. 1 per cent and in numerical-experimental data comparison with difference of 4 - 6 per cent. It can be used for further creep test which may include non-linear viscoelastic behaviour and creep rupture. From this paper, the variation of constants in Burger’s viscoelastic model is also studied and groups of constants values that can simulate solid, fluid and solid-fluid viscoelastic behaviours were obtained. In addition, the numerical peridynamic parameters were also manipulated and examined to achieve the optimal values of the parameters. Research limitations/implications – The peridynamic model of viscoelastic creep behaviour preferably should have only one time parameter. This can only be done by solving the unstable fluctuation of dynamic results, which is not discussed in this paper. Another limitation is the <b>tertiary</b> region and <b>creep</b> rupture are not included in this paper. Practical implications – The viscoelastic peridynamic model in this paper can serve as an alternative for conventional numerical simulations in viscoelastic area. This model also is the initial step of developing peridynamic model of viscoelastic creep rupture properties (crack initiation, crack propagation, crack branching, etc.), where this future model has high potential in predicting failure behaviours of any components, tools or structures, and hence increase safety and reduce loss. Originality/value – The application of viscoelastic creep constitutive model on peridynamic formulation, effect of peridynamic parameters manipulation on numerical result, and optimization of constants of viscoelastic model in simulating three types of viscoelastic creep behaviours. ...|$|R
40|$|The creep of {{materials}} {{is a research}} topic of major significance in the life assessment and design of many modern engineering components of advance technology such as: power generation plant, chemical plant, gas turbines, jet engines, spacecraft, components made of plastics and polymers, etc. To predict the creep lives of such components, one necessary ingredient is a creep damage model. The current creep damage models are either too cumbersome to be readily employed and/or not sufficiently accurate for practical applications. This thesis describes a new creep damage model to overcome {{some of the major}} shortcomings in current creep damage/life prediction methods. The proposed model is relatively simple and readily applicable to industrial cases yet it is sufficiently accurate. The proposed model assumes that, on a macroscopic level, the energy dissipated in the material may be taken as a measure of creep damage induced in the material. In another words, creep damage is directly proportional to the absorbed internal energy density (IED), i. e., the internal energy per unit of volume. In this way, the model takes into account both multi-axial loading and deformation. The model is formulated when the creep constitutive relationships may be expressed by primary plus steady-state or steady-state alone (IED-SS) {{as well as for the}} cases when the material behaviour includes the <b>creep</b> <b>tertiary</b> region (IED-T). The proposed model has been verified by applying it to various components for which the experimental creep lives are available from literature including thick/thin cylindrical vessels, notch bars with various notch-root radii and materials, multi-material cross welds bars, and perforated biaxial plates. The predicted creep lives of these components by the proposed model (IED-SS and IED-T) are compared with the experimental results and those obtained by the Reference Stress Method (RSM). It is shown that the maximum errors in relation to the creep lives of the above-mentioned components are: 18 % when IED-SS is applied, 38 % when IED-T is applied, and 301 % when RSM is applied. To estimate the effects of uncertainties in material data on the predicted creep life, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. To this end and in relation to Norton creep law, material parameters such as creep stress coefficient and stress exponent are considered. In addition, the sensitivity analysis included the uncertainties related to the uniaxial creep rupture data. As might be expected, the results suggest that the predicted creep life is most sensitive to the creep stress. Finally, the present research reveals that the proposed model is simple, practical and can be used in conjunction with any commercial finite element code with creep analysis capabilities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFracturing of {{freshwater}} granular ice up to failure under uniaxial compression creep was investigated from series of interrupted creep tests {{and from a}} multifractal analysis of the corresponding fracture patterns. At {{the early stages of}} damage corresponding to primary and secondary creep, the fracturing process is dominated by the nucleation of microcracks from stress concentrations within the material (unlike rocks, artificial freshwater ice does not contains starter flaws). Because of the crack nucleation mechanisms, the microstructure of the material (e. g., the nonfractal grain size distribution) strongly influences the organization of fracturing which is therefore nonfractal. As fracturing proceeds during <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep,</b> a hierarchical (fractal) organization of the fracturing emerges progressively over a wider scale range. At failure, this fractal organization is fully developed without detectable lower or upper bound, {{and the role of the}} initial microstructure has completely disappeared. Similarly, cracks are preferentially oriented along the compression axis at the early stages of damage, but this anisotropy vanishes as failure is approached. The simultaneity between the onset of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> and the emergence of fractal organization suggests that the acceleration of the deformation during <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> is due to the cataclasis of a material which becomes granular.

The results of some finite element analyses, in plane strain and axisymmetric regimes, are here discussed concerning the full face excavation of a deep circular tunnel. An elasto-visco-plastic constitutive model that accounts for <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> has been adopted and calibrated {{on the basis of}} laboratory test data. Some comments are drawn on the effects of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> and on the influence of the tunnel face advance on the closure of the opening and on the stress redistribution around it...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} {{creep behaviour}} in AISI 304 Stainless Steel at 873 and 973 K for different test conditions obeyed first order kinetics {{and it was}} shown that the validity of Monkman-Grant relation (MGR) {{is a consequence of}} first order kinetics. The analysis is extended to <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> regime and the results are found to obey first order kinetics for all test conditions. A new relationship between steady state and <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> is proposed as epsilon over dot ((sic) (s)) '. t(t) /epsilon(t) = constant (where t(t) and epsilon(t) are time spent in tertiary and the limiting <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> strain respectively); alpha' is found to be unity for all test conditions implying the validity of first order kinetics. Further, this relation (for alpha' = 1) is found to be identical to modified Monkman - Grant relation (MMGR; m' = 1 where m' is the exponent for epsilon over dot (s) in MMGR) for the conditions satisfying f = 1 /lambda and it is postulated that validity of MMGR is also a consequence of first order kinetics. When first order kinetics is applicable, a generalised relationship between steady state creep rate and rupture life is formulated and is valid for the results at all test conditions...|$|E
40|$|The creep and rupture {{behavior}} of 001 -line-oriented single crystals of the nickel-base superalloy NASAIR 100 was investigated at temperatures of 925 and 1000 C. In {{the stress and}} temperature ranges studied, the steady state creep rate, time to failure, time to the onset of secondary creep, and the time to the onset of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> all exhibited power law dependencies on the applied stress. The creep rate exponents for this alloy were between seven and eight, and the modulus-corrected activation energy for creep was approximately 350 kjoule/mole, which was comparable to the measured activation energy for Ostwald ripening of the gamma-prime precipitates. Oriented gamma-prime coarsening to form lamellae perpendicular to the applied stress was very prominent during creep. At 1000 C, {{the formation of a}} continuous gamma-gamma-prime lamellar structure was completed during the primary creep stage. Shear through the gamma-gamma-prime interface is considerd to be the rate limiting step in the deformation process. Gradual thickening of the lamellae appeared to be the cause of the onset of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep.</b> At 925 C, the fully developed lamellar structure was not achieved until the secondary or <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> stages. At this temperature, the gamma-gamma-prime lamellar structure {{did not appear to be}} as beneficial for creep resistance as at the higher temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reflect the {{tertiary}} rheological characteristics of hard rocks at the high stress states, a new nonlinear visco-elastic-plastic model is proposed {{on the basis of}} linear visco-elastic-plastic model and nonlinear visco-elastic-plasticity. And then the corresponding constitutive model are deduced, which can be used for describing rocks ’ long-term strength characteristics and their creep deformational behavior and time-dependent damage under interaction of coupled seepage-stress field in rock engineering. At last, considering the time effect of rock damage in the process of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep,</b> a coupled seepage-stress creep damage model for investigating the whole creep deformation behavior, including <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> failure process is established, and the related equations governing the evolution of stress, creep damage and rock permeability along with the creep deformation of rock is introduced...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of the non-linear creep effects around a deep circular tunnel driven in squeezing ground. The time-dependent behaviour of the geotechnical medium {{is described by}} means of a simple viscoplastic rheological model capable of approximating primary, secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> behaviours. It is shown that <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> can be allowed for by providing a suitable law governing the variation of some material parameters (such as viscosity) with stresses and strains. The basic operations of the evolutive procedure adopted for time integration are outlined. Along each time integration step, quadratic variations of the stress and strain fields and linear variations of the material parameters are assumed. The results of various finite element analyses are presented concerning both lined and unlined cases. For the lined cases, the influence of the liner stiffness and of the time elapsed between the end of excavation and the liner installation is considered...|$|E

The creep curves {{were found to}} consist of a relatively short primary stage, a minimum strain rate and an extended tertiary stage. There was no convincing evidence of a period of steady-state creep but the minimum creep rate {{was found to be}} highly dependent on applied stress through a power law with a stress exponent of ∼ 10. The early occurrence of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep,</b> after strains of only ∼ 0 · 01, was shown not to be caused by a loss of section associated with necking, internal void development nor with the formation of surface cracks. It is concluded that the most likely cause of the early onset of <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> in this alloy is the coarsening of strengthening precipitates. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. 2014...|$|E
40|$|In creep design, {{not only}} {{secondary}} creep but also primary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> regimes become important for an accurate creep life prediction {{and need to}} be accounted for in more sophisticated models. Mechanism-based theories showed a better potential since they usually leads to more accurate prediction over wider range of stress and temperature. It has long been recognized that the mechanics and kinetics of the deformation and recovery processes occurring at the microscale are determined by, amongst other things, the local effective stress while, at macroscopic level, it may still possible to discern an effective stress, which is different from the applied stress that drives the creep strain accumulation, [1]. Recently, the authors proposed an internal stress based model for primary creep, which is independent on the creep rate formulation at the steady state, ensuring the continuity of the creep curve at the transition between primary and secondary creep stages, [2]. In this work, in order to account for all creep stages, this modeling framework is extended further. In particular, for <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> stage, it is assumed that the occurrence of microstructural modifications (such as fine particle dissolution, secondary phase precipitations, etc.) is the process responsible for the reduction of the internal stress and consequent increase of the creep rate as result of the increment of the effective stress. The possibility to derive the internal stress decay function from <b>tertiary</b> <b>creep</b> data is discussed. The proposed model has been applied to P 91 high chromium steel and preliminary results are presented in this work...|$|E
