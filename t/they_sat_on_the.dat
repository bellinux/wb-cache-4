In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem, a meshuchrar, successfully campaigned against this discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} furniture, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, which {{was covered with}} two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and {{employing}} skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; {{there are only a}} few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.|$|E
500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch. It was {{a perfect}} night. The cool dusk was soothing.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground to a meal in which roast pork was the leading feature.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{dripping}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{big rock}} Josie suddenly gave a clutch that nearly sent Bess overboard, as she cried excitedly: ...|$|R
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." [...] The bench they sit in during that scene is the same one they sat on during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot for this moment. It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 1880, [...] "Buckskin" [...] Frank Leslie {{who had an}} eye for the ladies, escorted Mary Killen, the Commercial Hotel's housekeeper, to a dance. Accounts differ as {{to whether}} she was {{separated}} from her husband or still married to him. After the dance, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and were spotted by her drunken husband. Killen appeared {{out of the dark}} street and shot at Leslie, barely missing him. Leslie fired back and shot Mike Killen twice. Mike Killen died five days later and was buried in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery on June 22, 1880. Buckskin Frank Leslie had fired in self-defense and wasn't arrested.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone {{step of the}} fountain, {{where they}} were {{sheltered}} from the wind; and she buttoned his long coat about him.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later, <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terrace one calm evening when Watson {{came back with}} the car and gave Dick and Staffer some letters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hilda and I were {{considering}} {{a matter of}} which we will make thee judge," [...] said Erling, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank together.|$|R
60|$|This was {{accordingly}} done, {{and for an}} {{hour and}} a half <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof with their feet against the stack of chimneys.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocks by {{the fire}} and opened the farmer's bundle. There were cold, gristly roast beef, bread and cheese, and a large, angry-looking sausage.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ain't a-goin' to ride them seventy {{miles into}} Oakland {{on top of}} this?" [...] Joe demanded, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs and took a triumphant smoke.|$|E
60|$|Both {{boys were}} wet {{to the skin}} and covered with mud, {{presenting}} anything but an enviable appearance. For several seconds <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, panting for breath.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, and Ricardo {{showed them}} how {{he meant to}} manage it, {{just as he had}} told Jaqueline. As he said, nothing could be simpler.|$|R
60|$|So <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> divan and obeyed, keeping nothing {{back from}} the {{beginning}} to the end, nor, although the tale was long, did the Sultan weary of listening.|$|R
6000|$|Alice Deringham {{said nothing}} further upon the subject until Alton joined them as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{verandah}} that night. [...] "You are not pleased with me?" [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|That night, when supper was {{finished}} and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oblong box and pulled at their pipes, {{the circle of}} gleaming eyes drew in even closer than before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish the}} nurses â€™ud come, George," [...] he said, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck panting after their exertions; [...] "this {{is a pretty}} mess if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] he said, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony {{overlooking}} the river, waiting for Jack Bruce to return with his car, [...] "I've {{had a bit}} of a sickener." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> quiet sunshine, and {{a spider}} slid softly {{through the air}} and with busy claws set to its nets; and those small ghosts the robins went {{whistling}} restlessly among the heavy boughs.|$|R
6000|$|Godwin nodded, and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench {{beside the}} fire, {{for the weather}} was bitter, and dozed till the dawn began to break. Then Wulf rose and shook himself, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass. A faint white glare, {{rising from}} behind a belt of trees, {{indicated}} {{the position of the}} dancing-floor. The music was nothing but a muffled rhythmic pulse.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper balcony, enchanted by {{the moon}} glitter, she cried, [...] "Shall I {{go back to}} Gopher Prairie with you? Decide for me. I'm tired of {{deciding}} and undeciding." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank {{below the}} parapet {{of the old}} fort, hidden from observation. He circled her {{shoulder}} with his arm. Relaxed after the walk, a chill nipping her throat, conscious of his warmth and power, she leaned gratefully against him.|$|E
60|$|For the present, after tea, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rose-framed porch, while Rowland {{held his}} younger cousin between his knees, and she, enjoying her situation, listened timorously for {{the stroke of}} bedtime, Cecilia insisted on talking more about her visitor than about herself.|$|E
6000|$|Philip Wakem was a less {{frequent}} visitor, {{but he came}} occasionally in the evening, and it happened {{that he was there}} when Lucy said, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lawn, near sunset,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the baccy I miss, Daddy," [...] {{said the}} young pugilist, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon of the}} third day. [...] "Surely there can't be any harm in my havin' a pipe?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat,</b> at midnight, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{steps of}} the house in Tavistock Place.|$|R
60|$|There <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hard, hay-strewn floor, one entirely, and {{the other}} almost entirely covered with purple silk, their eyes fixed upon the bottle and the feeding calf. After a time the latter {{declined}} to take any more milk, and raised its head from Miriam's lap.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{anyone had}} told me what {{wonderful}} changes were to take place here in ten years, I wouldn't have believed it,' said Mrs Jo to Mrs Meg, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piazza at Plumfield one summer day, looking about them with faces full of pride and pleasure.|$|E
60|$|When noon came {{they opened}} the Fox-King's basket of luncheon, and found a nice roasted turkey with {{cranberry}} sauce and some slices of bread and butter. As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up the turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Amy!--my own!--my Verena!'--and he {{held fast}} {{one of her}} hands, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa--'I {{had a feeling that}} so it might be through the very worst, yet I can hardly believe it now.' ...|$|R
60|$|Lunch being over, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{cushioned}} transom; {{the servant}} placing a pillow behind his master. The long continuance of the calm had now affected the atmosphere. Don Benito sighed heavily, {{as if for}} breath.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{morning of}} the 12th, till they should learn the {{decision}} of the Assembly with regard to the King. De Lescure was there calm and grave, but with much melancholy in his countenance.|$|R
