Numerical solutions of the inviscid Euler equations were obtained for the flow over the Comanche fuselage with a uniform actuator disk and blade element models for the FANTAIL TM; the main rotor is excluded in this study. The solutions were obtained by running a modified PUMA 2 (Parallel Unstructured Maritime Aerodynamics) computational fluid dynamics code with an unstructured grid with 2. 8 million tetrahedral cells.

Flow visualization is done by injecting air bubbles and fluorescent dye tangentially from the blade tips to mark the vortex core, showing the development of both short-wave (“sinuous”) and long-wave (“leapfrogging”) instabilities on the helical vortices in the wake. Strain gages are used to record transient loads, allowing a correlation between the rotor thrust performance and the development of the vortex wake. Reynolds numbers are of order 105 and test runs are performed for extended periods — up to 500 rotor revolutions — demonstrating the repeatability of the patterns of thrust variation. The data indicate that as the instabilities develop, adjacent vortices merge and form thick vortex rings, particularly during descent. Periodic shedding of these rings from the wake associated with vortex ring state is observed, resulting in peak-to-peak thrust fluctuations of up to 95 % of the mean and occurring at regular intervals of 20 — 50 rotor revolutions, depending on flow parameters.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMC) is {{the ability}} of equipment to function satisfactorily in an electromagnetic environment and not to introduce intolerable disturbances to the environment or other equipment. With any new product design there are many areas of risk. One significant area of risk is EMC conformance. Conformance to international EMC standards is fast becoming mandatory in the international marketplace. Failure to meet mandatory EMC standards inevitably leads to being locked out of many large markets. More commonly, EMC conformance, or lack thereof, can often cause delays to project schedules and increase the manufacturing cost of a product. These factors make it very important to consider EMC conformance at all stages in the development life cycle. At the HP Australian Telecom Operation (ATO), management of regulatory compliance is primarily the responsibility of the EMC specialist within the manufacturing engineering group. The EMC specialist is chartered with the role of ensuring that products meet all required regulatory standards. This is achieved by providing EMC design expertise and managing the product qualification process. However, compliance cannot be achieved by activities within the manufacturing engineering group alone. To drive the compliance process, close cooperation between the R&D and manufacturing engineering groups is required. Responsibility for new product compliance needs to be shared by members of both groups. With responsibility shared across two functional groups {{it is very important to}} coordinate EMC risk-reducing activities with a well-defined process.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] work aimed to identify and address the main challenges associated with fabricating large samples of carbon foams composed of interwoven networks of carbon nanofibers. Solutions to two difficulties related {{with the process of}} fabricating carbon foams, maximum foam size and catalyst cost, were developed. First, a simple physical method was invented to scale-up the constrained formation of fibrous nanostructures process (CoFFiN) to fabricate relatively large foams. Specifically, a gas deflector system capable of maintaining conditions supportive of carbon nanofiber foam growth throughout a relatively large mold was developed. ANSYS CFX models were used to simulate the gas flow paths with and without deflectors; the data generated proved to be a very useful tool for the deflector design. Second, a simple method for selectively leaching the Pd catalyst material trapped in the foam during growth was successfully tested. Multiple techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, surface area measurements, and mechanical testing, were employed to characterize the foams generated in this study. All results confirmed that the larger foam samples preserve the basic characteristics: their interwoven nanofiber microstructure forms a low-density tridimensional solid with viscoelastic behavior. Fiber growth mechanisms are also discussed. Larger samples of mechanically-robust carbon nanofiber foams will enable the use of these materials as strain sensors, shock absorbers, selective absorbents for environmental remediation and electrodes for energy storage devices, among other applications.

40|$|Summary. -Camber {{and twist}} {{is applied to}} the problem of {{reducing}} the drag due to incidence, of thin triangular or swept-back wings, at supersonic speeds, with subsonic leading edges and supersonic or sonic trailing edges. Two cases are considered: (i) with leading-edge suction forces ignored, (ii) with leading-edge suction forces included. It is found that twist, especially towards the wing tips, is more effective in reducing drag, for given lift, for the larger values of tan yjtan u, where y is the semi-apex-angle and ft is the Mach angle, and that camber is more effective for the smaller values, though, in general, the best results are obtained by a suitable combination of camber and twist. For triangular wings, with suction ignored, the maximum percentage drag reduction varies from about 10 per cent (for sonic leading edges) to 50 per cent (for very slender plan-forms) and, if suction forces are included, from zero (for very slender plan-forms) to about 10 per cent (when the leading edges are sonic). The effect of the swept-back trailing edge is, in general, to increase the maximum percentage drag reduction for given lift if suction forces are ignored; but to decrease the maximum reduction for smaller values of tan yjtan ft, and to increase the maximum reduction for values of tan yjtan ft near to one, if suction forces are included.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and field experimental {{program has been}} carried out to investigate the use of tip devices on horizontal axis wind turbine rotors. The objective was to improve performance by the reduction of tip losses. While power output can always be increased by a simple radial tip extension, such a modification also results in an increased gale load both because of the extra projected area and longer moment arm. Tip devices have the potential to increase power output without such a structural penalty. A vortex lattice computer model was used to optimize three basic tip configuration types for a 25 kW stall limited commercial wind turbine. The types were a change in tip planform, and a single-element and double-element nonplanar tip extension (winglets). A complete data acquisition system was developed which recorded three wind speed components, ambient pressure, temperature, and turbine output. The system operated unattended and could perform real-time processing of the data, displaying the measured power curve as data accumulated in either a bin sort mode or polynomial curve fit. Approximately 270 hr of perormance data were collected over a three-month period. The sampling interval was 2. 4 sec; <b>thrus</b> over 400, 000 raw data points were logged. Results {{for each of the three}} new tip devices, compared with the original tip, showed a small decrease (of the order of 1 kW) in power output over the measured range of wind speeds from cut-in at about 4 m/s to over 20 m/s, well into the stall limiting region. Changes in orientation and angle-of-attack of the winglets were not made. For aircraft wing tip devices, favorable tip shapes have been reported and it is likely that the tip devices tested in this program did not improve rotor performance because they were not optimally adjusted...|$|E

40|$|An Improved Short-Open-Load-Reciprocal (SOLR) Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) {{calibration}} {{is developed}} and validated. Through {{the use of}} a more complex load model the usable frequency range of the SOLR calibration algorithm is expanded. Comparisons are made between this new calibration and existing calibration techniques that are known to be accurate at high frequencies. The Anritsu 37 xxx Lightning series 65 GHz VNA is used as the principle measurement tool for calibration comparison and verification. This work is built off of previous work done at USF in which it is shown that the Short-Open-Load-Thru (SOLT) calibrations accuracy improves through the implementation of more complex load and thru models. One of the most significant advantages of the SOLR calibration algorithm {{is that it does not}} require an ideal well behaved thru standard. This is extremely useful in multiport probing environments where it is often necessary for speed and space conservation purposes to use loopback <b>thrus</b> or other non-ideal transmission structures during calibration. Multiport test equipment and measurement techniques are highlighted and discussed. A general n-port expansion of a two-port calibration algorithm is presented and used to adapt the improved two-port SOLR algorithm to a four-port calibration. In doing so a theoretical development that addresses error model treatment, and switch term corrections is presented that includes an improved set of the redundancy equations that enable the multiport SOLR algorithm. The algorithm uses a four-port SOL calibration at each port and then determines the remaining error terms by measuring a minimal set of reciprocal passive standards. The four-port SOLR algorithm developed was illustrated through {{the use of a}} four-port test set that consists of a two-port VNA input multiplexed to four-ports through an RF switch array. Verification of the four-port SOLR calibration is made by comparing it to available four-port calibration techniques using available on-wafer test structures. As another promising advance of the work the possibility of using of a multiport reciprocal standard is shown to have potential for reducing the number of standard connections needed to accomplish multiport SOLR calibration. Differential measurements are facilitated through mixed-mode calculations of single ended S-parameter measurements made with the four-port SOLR calibrations improved with this work...|$|E
