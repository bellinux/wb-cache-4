25|$|Together they crafted jazz-influenced {{soul and}} funk that brought new depth and {{political}} consciousness to '70s music alongside Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. In classic albums such as Winter in America and From South Africa to South Carolina, Scott-Heron took <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and proto-rap anthems. He updated his dispatches {{from the front}} lines of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music".|$|E

500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They {{are the ones who are}} actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Webster {{was a man}} {{of strong}} convictions. As a Lincoln Republican and a tenured, highly {{respected}} captain of Chicago's Sixth Ward black Republican machine, Webster was a stern, but gregarious leader of men who was well connected throughout the Chicago politic. [...] Not the orator of Randolph's skill, and not college educated, Webster devoured books and <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and was a stalwart back room negotiator. [...] He captured his audience with his command of the subject, his keen wit and sharp intellect, and his commitment to alleviating the struggles of the working man.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E

60|$|This {{custom of}} promulgating {{everything}} by criers, {{is not confined}} to the Nez Perces, but prevails among many other tribes. It has its advantage where there are no gazettes to publish <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> or to report the proceedings of important meetings. And in fact, reports of this kind, viva voce, made in the hearing of all parties, and liable to be contradicted or corrected on the spot, are more likely to convey accurate information to the public mind than those circulated through the press. The office of crier is generally filled by some old man, who is good for little else. A village has generally several of these walking newspapers, as they are termed by the whites, who go about proclaiming <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> giving notice of public councils, expeditions, dances, feasts, and other ceremonials, and advertising anything lost. While Captain Bonneville remained among the Nez Perces, if a glove, handkerchief, or anything of similar value, was lost or mislaid, it was carried by the finder to the lodge of the chief, and proclamation was made by one of their criers, for the owner to come and claim his property.|$|E
60|$|ON {{their way}} through the streets, Father Benwell talked as {{persistently}} of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> as if he had nothing else in his thoughts. To keep his companion's mind in a state of suspense was, in certain emergencies, to exert a useful preparatory influence over a man of Romayne's character. Even when they reached his lodgings, the priest still hesitated to approach the object that he had in view. He made considerate inquiries, in the character of a hospitable man.|$|E
