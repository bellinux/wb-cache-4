40|$|The primary receptors for {{aspartate}} and serine in bacterial chemotaxis {{have been}} shown to be the 60, 000 -dalton proteins encoded by the tar and tsr genes. The evidence is: (i) overproduction of the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> product at various levels by recombinant DNA techniques produces proportionate increases in aspartate binding; (ii) aspartate binding copurifies with [3 H]methyl-labeled <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> product; (iii) antibody to tar and tsr protein fragments precipitates a single species of protein (60, 000 daltons) which retains binding capacity and [3 H]carboxymethyl label. Partially purified <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> product can be reconstituted into artificial vesicles and retains aspartate binding and aspartate-sensitive methylation and demethylation. These results show that the aspartate and serine receptors are transmembrane proteins of a single polypeptide chain with the receptor recognition site on the outside of the membrane and the covalent methylation site on the inside...|$|E
40|$|The tar {{locus of}} Escherichia coli {{specifies}} {{one of the}} major species of methylaccepting proteins involved in the chemotactic behavior of this organism. The physical and genetic organization of the tar region was investigated with a series of specialized A transducing phages and plasmid clones. The <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> was mapped at the promoter-proximal end of an operon containing five other chemotaxisrelated loci. Four of those genes (cheR, cheB, che Y and cheZ) are required for all chemotactic responses; consequently, polar mutations in the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> resulted in a generally nonchemotactic phenotype. The fifth gene, tap, was mapped between the tar and cheR loci and specified the production of a 65 -kilodalton methylaccepting protein. Unlike the tar locus, which is required for chemotaxis to aspartate and maltose, mutants lacking only the tap function had no obvious defects in chemotactic ability. Genetic and physical maps of the tar-tap region were constructed with Mu dl (Apr lac) insertion mutations, whose polar properties conferred a phenotype suitable for deletion mapping studies.

40|$|Maltose-binding protein (MBP), {{which is}} encoded by the malE gene, is the maltose {{chemoreceptor}} of Escherichia coli, {{as well as}} an essential component of the maltose uptake system. Maltose-loaded MBP is thought to initiate a chemotactic response by binding to the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> product, the signal transducer Tar, which is also the aspartate chemoreceptor. To study the interaction of MBP with Tar, we selected 14 malE mutants which had specific defects in maltose taxis. Three of these mutants were fully active in maltose transport and produced MBP in normal amounts. The isoelectric points of the MBPs from these three mutants were identical to (malE 461 and malE 469) or only 0. 1 pH unit more basic than (malE 454) the isoelectric point of the wild-type protein (pH 5. 0). Six of the mutations, including malE 454, malE 461, and malE 469, were mapped in detail; they were located in two regions within malE. We also isolated second-site suppressor mutations in the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> that restored maltose taxis in combination with the closely linked malE 454 and malE 461 mutations but not with the malE 469 mutation, which maps in {{a different part of the}} gene.

40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (Methicillin Resistant S. aureus), is an {{acquired}} pathogen {{and the primary}} cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. In S. aureus, teichoic acid is an essential component of the cell wall, and its biosynthesis is not yet well characterized. Studies in Bacillus subtilis have discovered two different pathways of teichoic acid biosynthesis, in two strains W 23 and 168 respectively, namely teichoic acid ribitol (tar) and teichoic acid glycerol (tag). The genes involved in these two pathways are also characterized, tarA, tarB, tarD, tarI, tarJ, tarK, tarL for the tar pathway, and tagA, tagB, tagD, tagE, tagF for the tag pathway. With the genome sequences of several MRSA strains: Mu 50, MW 2, N 315, MRSA 252, COL as well as methicillin susceptible strain MSSA 476 available, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to characterize teichoic acid biosynthesis in these S. aureus strains. Results We identified all S. aureus <b>tar</b> and tag <b>gene</b> orthologs in the selected S. aureus strains which would contribute to teichoic acids sythesis. Based on our identification of genes orthologous to tarI, tarJ, tarL, which are specific to tar pathway in B. subtilis W 23, we also concluded that tar is the major teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in S. aureus. Further analyses indicated that the S. aureus <b>tar</b> <b>genes,</b> different from the divergon organization in B. subtilis, are organized into several clusters in cis. Most interesting, compared with genes in B. subtilis tar pathway, the S. aureus <b>tar</b> specific <b>genes</b> (tarI,J,L) are duplicated in all six S. aureus genomes. Conclusion In the S. aureus strains we analyzed, tar (teichoic acid ribitol) is the main teichoic acid biogenesis pathway. The <b>tar</b> <b>genes</b> are organized into several genomic groups in cis and the <b>genes</b> specific to <b>tar</b> (relative to tag) : tarI, tarJ, tarL are duplicated. The genomic organization of the S. aureus tar pathway suggests their regulations are different when compared to B. subtilis tar or tag pathway, which are grouped in two operons in a divergon structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|A general {{method for}} {{constructing}} lambda specialized transducing phages is described. The method, which is potentially applicable to any gene of Escherichia coli, {{is based on}} using Mu DNA homology to direct the integration of a lambda pMu phage near the genes whose transduction is desired. With this method we isolated a lambda transducing phage carrying all 10 genes in the che gene cluster (map location, 41. 5 to 42. 5 min). The products of the cheA and <b>tar</b> <b>genes</b> were identified by using transducing phages with amber mutations in these genes. It was established that tar codes for methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein II (molecular weight, 62, 000) and that cheA codes for two polypeptides (molecular weights, 76, 000 and 66, 000).

The gene product was detected and localized in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell by immunoblotting with anti-Tar antibodies. The C-terminal fragments from wild-type and mutant <b>tar</b> <b>genes</b> were characterized in vivo. The C-terminal fragment generated from tar- 526, a mutation that results in a dominant "tumble" phenotype, {{was found to be}} deamidated and methylated by the CheB and CheR proteins, respectively. The C-terminal fragment derived from a wild-type gene was poorly deamidated, and the C-terminal fragment derived from tar- 529, a dominant mutant with a "smooth swimming" phenotype, was not apparently modified. Cells carrying the C-terminal fragment with the tar- 526 mutation as the sole receptor-transducer protein showed a high frequency of tumbling and chemotaxis responses to changes in intracellular pH. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic C-terminal fragment of Tar retains some of the functions of the whole protein in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Wall teichoic acids are anionic, phosphate-rich {{polymers}} {{linked to}} the peptidoglycan of gram-positive bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, the predominant wall teichoic acid types are poly(glycerol phosphate) in strain 168 and poly(ribitol phosphate) in strain W 23, and they are synthesized by the tag and <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> products, respectively. Growing evidence suggests that wall teichoic acids are essential in B. subtilis; however, {{it is widely believed}} that teichoic acids are dispensable under phosphate-limiting conditions. In the work reported here, we carefully studied the dispensability of teichoic acid under phosphate-limiting conditions by constructing three new mutants. These strains, having precise deletions in tagB, tagF, and tarD, were dependent on xylose-inducible complementation from a distal locus (amyE) for growth. The tarD deletion interrupted poly(ribitol phosphate) synthesis in B. subtilis and represents a unique deletion of a <b>tar</b> <b>gene.</b> When teichoic acid biosynthetic proteins were depleted, the mutants showed a coccoid morphology and cell wall thickening. The new wall teichoic acid biogenesis mutants generated in this work and a previously reported tagD mutant were not viable under phosphate-limiting conditions in the absence of complementation. Cell wall analysis of B. subtilis grown under phosphate-limited conditions showed that teichoic acid contributed approximately one-third of the wall anionic content. These data suggest that wall teichoic acid has an essential function in B. subtilis that cannot be replaced by teichuronic acid...|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of the Bacillus subtilis W 23 <b>tar</b> <b>genes</b> specifying the biosynthesis of the major wall teichoic acid, the poly(ribitol phosphate), was studied under phosphate limitation using lacZ reporter fusions. Three different regulation patterns can be deduced from these beta-galactosidase activity data: (i) tarD and tarL gene expression is downregulated under phosphate starvation; (ii) tarA and, to a minor extent, tarB expression after an initial decrease unexpectedly increases; and (iii) tarO is not influenced by phosphate concentration. To dissect the tarA regulatory pattern, its two promoters were analysed under phosphate limitation: The P(tarA) -ext promoter is repressed under phosphate starvation by the PhoPR two-component system, whereas, under the same conditions, the P(tarA) -int promoter is upregulated {{by the action of}} an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor, sigma(M). In contrast to strain 168, sigma(M) is activated in strain W 23 in phosphate-depleted conditions, a phenomenon indirectly dependent on PhoPR, the two-component regulatory system responsible for the adaptation to phosphate starvation. These results provide further evidence for the role of sigma(M) in cell-wall stress response, and suggest that impairment of cell-wall structure is the signal activating this ECF sigma factor...|$|R

The nonsense mutations were distributed throughout the gene, while the missense mutations were found to cluster {{in a region that}} includes 185 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the Tar protein. Partial characterization of mutant phenotypes suggested that some are completely defective in signaling while responding to attractants and repellents by differential methylation.

40|$|A {{chemotaxis}} gene encoding {{a protein}} with receptorlike properties {{has been identified}} in Salmonella typhimurium and termed tip for taxis-involved protein. Based on the stringency of DNA hybridization, the tip gene has about 75 % homology with a region of the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the aspartate receptor. Introduction of the tip gene into a smooth-swimming Escherichia coli receptor mutant (tar tsr tap) restored both chemotaxis ability on soft-agar-tryptone plates and a wild-type swimming phenotype. We have shown, by overexpressing the CheY protein, that shifting of the mutant swimming bias {{in the absence of}} receptors is insufficient to restore chemotaxis ability. This suggests that in addition to resetting the swimming bias, the tip gene product functions as a receptor. By functional criteria, we found that Tip is not a duplicate aspartate (Tar) or serine (Tsr) receptor gene.

40|$|The Tar protein of Escherichia coli is a {{chemotactic}} signal transducer {{that spans}} the cytoplasmic membrane and mediates {{responses to the}} attractants aspartate and maltose. Aspartate binds directly to Tar, whereas maltose binds to the periplasmic maltose-binding protein, which then interacts with Tar. The Arg- 64, Arg- 69, and Arg- 73 residues of Tar have previously {{been shown to be}} involved in aspartate sensing. When lysine residues are introduced at these positions by site-directed mutagenesis, aspartate taxis is disrupted most by substitution at position 64, and maltose taxis is disrupted most by substitution at position 73. To explore the spatial distribution of ligand recognition sites on Tar further, we performed doped-primer mutagenesis in selected regions of the <b>tar</b> <b>gene.</b> A number of mutations that interfere specifically with aspartate taxis (Asp-), maltose taxis (Mal-), or both were identified. Mutations affecting residues 64 to 73 or 149 to 154 in the periplasmic domain of Tar are associated with an Asp- phenotype, whereas mutations affecting residues 73 to 83 or 141 to 150 are associated with a Mal- phenotype.

40|$|Observations {{gained from}} model organisms are essential, yet {{it remains unclear}} to which degree they are {{applicable}} to distant relatives. For example, in the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), auxin biosynthesis via indole- 3 -pyruvic acid (IPA) is essential for root development and requires redundant TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA 1) and TAA 1 -RELATED (<b>TAR)</b> <b>genes.</b> A promoter T-DNA insertion in the monocotyledon Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) <b>TAR</b> 2 -LIKE <b>gene</b> (BdTAR 2 L) severely down-regulates expression, suggesting reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity in this mutant, which thus represents a hypomorphic Bdtar 2 l allele (Bdtar 2 l(hypo)). Counterintuitive however, Bdtar 2 l(hypo) mutants display dramatically elongated seminal roots because of enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype is also observed in another, stronger Bdtar 2 l allele and can be mimicked by treating wild type with L-kynerunine, a specific TAA 1 /TAR inhibitor. Surprisingly, L-kynerunine-treated as well as Bdtar 2 l roots display elevated rather than reduced auxin levels. This {{does not appear to}} result from compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Rather, expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of IPA to auxin, is increased in Bdtar 2 l mutants. Consistent with suppression of Bdtar 2 l(hypo) root phenotypes upon application of the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic-acid (ACC), BdYUCCA genes are down-regulated upon ACC treatment. Moreover, they are up-regulated in a downstream ethylene-signaling component homolog mutant, Bd ethylene insensitive 2 -like 1, which also displays a Bdtar 2 l root phenotype. In summary, Bdtar 2 l phenotypes contrast with gradually reduced root growth and auxin levels described for Arabidopsis taa 1 /tar mutants. This could be explained if in Brachypodium, ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation, as suggested by our observations. Thus, our results reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis...|$|R

Deletions were obtained by selecting for loss or a defective Mu d 1 prophage inserted in either the <b>tar</b> or tap <b>gene.</b> The extent of the tar deletions was determined by genetic mapping with Southern hybridization. Representative deletion mutants were surveyed for chemotactic responses on semisolid agar and by temporal stimulation in a tethered cell assay to assess flagellar rotational responses to chemoeffector compounds. The tar deletion strains exhibited complete loss of aspartate and maltose responses, whereas the tap deletion strains displayed a wild-type phenotype under all conditions tested.

In addition, acetyl-salicylate and salicylate induced {{resistance to}} nalidixic acid and tetracycline. The induction of resistance was highly efficient but varied somewhat with the strain and inducer used. In the presence of inducers, from 10 % to 100 % of the cells formed colonies on antibiotic media, an increase of 10 - to 1000 -fold over the controls without inducer. After growth {{in the absence of}} these inducers, the cells were normally sensitive to the antibiotics. Thus, the resistance was not due to a heritable change. These inducers also increased the level of chloramphenicol resistance of a strain carrying cat (whose gene product inactivates chloramphenicol by acetylation). All of the inducers are chemotactic repellents for E. coli, and they are detected by the tsr gene product (with the possible exceptions of dimethyl sulfoxide and methylpyrrolidinone, whose modes of detection are not known). Nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate, repellents that are detected by the <b>tar</b> <b>gene</b> product, neither promoted resistance to chloramphenicol nor prevented the induction of resistance by acetylsalicylate.

The ORF was confirmed as ceN by comparing the N-terminal sequence of purified recombinant CelI with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. CelI hydrolysed lichenan and carboxymethylcellulose, but was principally active against barley Fglucan. It exhibited significant sequence identity with subfamily E, endoglucanases, and by analogy with others in this group contains a catalytic domain of around 500 residues located in the N-terminal half of the protein. The C-terminal region of CelI was highly homologous with the cellulose-binding domain of the non-catalytic cellulosome subunit, S 1. A repeated segment, previously shown to be highly conserved in xylanase Z and in other endoglucanases from C. thermocellum, was absent from CelI.

After induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, cells containing the plasmids produced about 10 % of their soluble cellular protein as the carboxy-terminal fragments. A scheme to purify the overproduced fragments was developed. Typical yields of pure fragment were 5, 30, and 20 mg per liter of induced culture for the wild type, 526 mutant, and 529 mutant, respectively. Fast-protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration analysis of the pure fragments showed that they all existed as oligomers (ca. 103, 000 daltons), possibly trimers or tetramers (monomer size is 31, 000 daltons). However, the 529 mutant fragment showed an additional oligomeric form (240, 000 daltons) corresponding approximately to an octamer. When chromatographed in the presence of 1 % octylglucoside, all three fragments showed an identical single oligomeric size of about 135, 000 daltons. Further differences between the fragments such as ion-exchange behavior and susceptibility to degradation were found.

Two of them replace threonine at residue 53 of MBP with isoleucine (MBP-TI 53), one replaces an aspartate at residue 55 with asparagine (MBP-DN 55), and the fourth replaces threonine at residue 345 with isoleucine (MBP-TI 345). The chemotactic defects of MBP-TI 53 and MBP-DN 55, but not of MBP-TI 345, are suppressed by mutations in the <b>tar</b> <b>gene.</b> Of the tar mutations, the most effective suppressor (isolated independently three times) replaces Arg- 73 of Tar with tryptophan.

One of these mutations introduces glutamine at residue 73 of Tar, the other replaces arginine at residue 69 of Tar with cysteine. These results suggest that regions of MBP that include residues 53 to 55 and residue 345 are important for the interaction with Tar.

40|$|Septoria leaf blotch, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Zymoseptoria tritici, {{is one of the}} most damaging diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum), a crop plant of significant worldwide importance. Using the system of Virus-Induced Gene Silencing, to create transient knockdowns of target genes, a novel wheat <b>gene,</b> <b>TaR</b> 1, was identified as playing a key role in the host response to this pathogen. Silencing this gene leads to the earlier onset of disease symptoms, but reduced reproduction of the causal pathogen. Sequence analysis, confocal microscopy and protein-protein interaction assays were used to determine that the protein TaR 1 localises the nucleus, where its function involves the binding of histones. Precisely, TaR 1 is able to bind the Histone 3 subunit, specifically methylated on Lysine 4. Through this action, the host defence response is delayed, and successful pathogen colonisation is promoted. It is hypothesised that this is an example of the pathogen ‘hi-jacking’ TaR 1 from its original function, in order to complete its lifecycle. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant cell}} {{wall is a}} highly dynamic {{structure}} that changes in response to both environmental and developmental cues. It plays important roles throughout plant growth and development in determining the orientation and extent of cell expansion, providing structural support and acting {{as a barrier to}} pathogens. Despite the importance of the cell wall, the signaling pathways regulating its function are not well understood. Two partially redundant leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), FEI 1 and FEI 2, regulate cell wall function in Arabidopsis thaliana roots; disruption of the FEIs results in short, swollen roots as a result of decreased cellulose synthesis. We screened for suppressors of this swollen root phenotype and identified two mutations in the putative mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase E 1 a homolog, IAA-Alanine Resistant 4 (IAR 4). Mutations in IAR 4 were shown previously to disrupt auxin homeostasis and lead to reduced auxin function. We show that mutations in IAR 4 suppress a subset of the fei 1 fei 2 phenotypes. Consistent with the hypothesis that the suppression of fei 1 fei 2 by iar 4 is the result of reduced auxin function, disruption of the WEI 8 and <b>TAR</b> 2 <b>genes,</b> which decreases auxin biosynthesis, also suppresses fei 1 fei 2. In addition, iar 4 suppresses the root swelling and accumulation of ectopic lignin phenotypes of other cell wall mutants, including procuste and cobra. Further, iar 4 mutants display decreased sensitivity to the cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor isoxaben. These results establish a role for IAR 4 in the regulation of cell wall function and provide evidence of crosstalk between the cell wall and auxin during cell expansion in the root...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{information}} {{is now available}} about the human genome and expressed sequences have been identif ied for most genes. Unti l recently there was no opportunity to specifically isolate genes or specif ic chromosomal regions from genomic DNA. We have utilized transformation-associated recombination (TAR) in yeast to isolate genes and specific regions from total human DNA. This has been demonstrated by the direct isolation of complete copies of rDNA, BRCA 1, BRCA 2 and HPRT genes with high fidelity as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). We propose {{that there are many}} utilities of <b>TAR</b> cloning including <b>gene</b> therapy and diagnostics. The Human Genome Project has made great strides in the decade since its inception including the cloning of most of the chromosomal DNA, the identification of unique sequences (sequence tags sites, STS's) approximately every 150 kb and the sequencing of short regions of almost all the expressed genes (expressed sequence tags, EST's). The project is ahead of schedule in that most of the genome will be sequenced within th...|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, it {{is widely}} assumed that genes coding for {{proteins}} and structural RNAs do not overlap. Using a transposon-tagging strategy to globally analyze the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome for expressed genes, we identified multiple insertions in an open reading frame that is contained fully within and transcribed antisense to the 25 S rRNA gene in the nuclear rDNA repeat region on Chromosome XII. Expression of this <b>gene,</b> <b>TAR</b> 1 (Transcript Antisense to Ribosomal RNA), can be detected at the RNA and protein levels, and the primary sequence of the corresponding 124 -amino-acid protein is conserved in several yeast species. Tar 1 p was found to localize to mitochondria, and overexpression of the protein suppresses the respiration-deficient petite phenotype of a point mutation in mitochondrial RNA polymerase that affects mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA stability. These findings indicate that coding information for protein and structural RNAs can overlap, raising issues regarding the coevolution of such complex genes, and also suggest that rDNA transcription and mitochondrial function are coordinately regulated in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|The term "biomarker" {{refers to}} an {{indicator}} employed to monitor the interactions between a xenobiotic and an individual, provide information of an individual's biologic state, or refer to an individual's susceptibility to a xenobiotic, condition or disease. They are currently employed to assess exposure to, or effects from, environmental toxicants. It {{is important to have}} biomarkers that can accurately and precisely assess complex mixture exposures, since environmental exposures to single substances rarely occur outside the laboratory setting, and complex exposures are often associated with specific occupational or environmental settings. This project employed microarray technology and subsequent bioinformatic analyses to identify candidate biomarkers of in vitro exposure to coal tar extract. Murine pulmonary epithelial cells were exposed to coal <b>tar</b> extract and <b>gene</b> expression was assessed using microarrays. The results showed that expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, cytokine-cytokine interaction, angiogenesis, as well as several genes that code for secreted proteins, were altered by coal tar exposure. The entire work constitutes the initial stages of a project that will ultimately identify gene expression and secretome profiles that are specific to coal tar exposure...|$|R
40|$|The multicopper oxidase laccase is {{widespread}} in fungi and has great industrial importance. One puzzle regarding laccase {{production in the}} basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans {{is that it is}} inhibited by high temperature (e. g., 37 °C). In this paper, we report identification of a nitrogen metabolite repression-related <b>gene,</b> <b>TAR</b> 1, which is responsible for laccase repression. Disruption of TAR 1 results in {{a significant increase in the}} level of LAC 1 mRNA at 37 °C. The putative protein Tar 1 shares a moderate level of similarity with the nitrogen metabolite repressors Nmr 1 and NmrA from Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans, respectively. Likewise, Tar 1 has a negative role in the utilization of nitrate. Furthermore, the structure of Tar 1 is unique. Tar 1 lacks the long C-terminal region of Nmr 1 and NmrA. It contains the canonical Rossmann fold motif, GlyXXGlyXXGly, whereas Nmr 1 and NmrA have variable residues at the Gly positions. Interestingly, the promoter region of TAR 1 contains three TTC/GAA repeats which are likely the heat shock factor (Hsf) binding sites, implying that Hsf has a role in laccase inhibition. TAR 1 mediation of temperature-associated repression of LAC 1 suggests a novel mechanism of laccase regulation and a new function for Nmr proteins. Our work may be helpful for industry in terms of promotion of laccase activity...|$|R
40|$|When grown aerobically, Salmonella typhimurium {{exhibits}} {{a low level}} of entry into tissue culture cells. We have isolated an S. typhimurium Tn 10 mutant which, when grown under aerobic conditions, efficiently invades HEp- 2 cells. Sequencing of S. typhimurium DNA adjacent {{to the site of the}} Tn 10 element showed that the insertion disrupted transcription of the aspartate receptor <b>gene,</b> <b>tar.</b> Polar effects of the transposon on downstream genes also eliminated chemotaxis. Isogenic nonchemotactic (Che-), as well as nonmotile (Mot-) and nonflagellated (Fla-), S. typhimurium strains were examined for their ability to invade HEp- 2 cells. "Smooth" swimming Che- mutants (cheA, cheW, cheR, and cheY) were found to possess increased invasiveness for cultured mammalian cells. In contrast, a "tumbly" cheB mutant and Mot- (flagellated) strain were found to have decreased levels of tissue culture invasiveness. A Fla- strain was found to be as invasive as the wild-type strain if centrifugation was used to facilitate contact with the monolayer surface. In addition, the observed hyperinvasiveness of the smooth swimming tar::Tn 10 mutant was suppressed when the strain was paralyzed by the introduction of a mot or fla mutation. A murine infection model was used to demonstrate that the mutant invasive phenotypes were also observed in vivo. These data are most consistent with the idea that the rotation and physical orientation of flagella around the bacteria affect the ability of salmonellae to enter host cells...|$|R
40|$|For the ∼ 1 % of {{the human}} genome in the ENCODE regions, only about half of the transcriptionally active regions (TARs) {{identified}} with tiling microarrays correspond to annotated exons. Here we categorize this large amount of “unannotated transcription. ” We use a number of disparate features to classify the 6988 novel TARs—array expression profiles across cell lines and conditions, sequence composition, phylogenetic profiles (presence/absence of syntenic conservation across 17 species), and locations relative to genes. In the classification, we first filter out TARs with unusual sequence composition and those likely resulting from cross-hybridization. We then associate some of those remaining with proximal exons having correlated expression profiles. Finally, we cluster unclassified TARs into putative novel loci, based on similar expression and phylogenetic profiles. To encapsulate our classification, we construct a Database of Active Regions and Tools (DART. gersteinlab. org). DART has special facilities for rapidly handling and comparing many sets of TARs and their heterogeneous features, synchronizing across builds, and interfacing with other resources. Overall, we find that ∼ 14 % of the novel TARs can be associated with known genes, while ∼ 21 % can be clustered into ∼ 200 novel loci. We observe that <b>TARs</b> associated with <b>genes</b> are enriched in the potential to form structural RNAs and many novel TAR clusters are associated with nearby promoters. To benchmark our classification, we design a set of experiments for testing the connectivity of novel TARs. Overall, we find that 18 of the 46 connections tested validate by RT-PCR and four of five sequenced PCR products confirm connectivity unambiguously...|$|R
40|$|We are {{investigating}} {{a strategy for}} somatic gene therapy to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection by intracellular expression of an RNA decoy and a ribozyme. The RNA decoy, consisting of polymeric Tat activation response elements (TARs), is designed to compete for Tat binding in an equilibrium with viral TAR RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication. The expression of polymeric TAR is regulated by the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) and transcriptional activation {{is dependent on the}} presence of HIV Tat. Our initial studies indicated that plasmids expressing up to 50 tandem copies of TAR RNA (50 <b>TAR)</b> inhibited tat-mediated <b>gene</b> expression by > 90 % in a transient transfection assay. A HIV LTR-driven 50 TAR construct was subcloned into a replication-defective retroviral vector to ensure high-efficiency gene transfer into T lymphocytes. In addition, a gag RNA-specific ribozyme gene was introduced into the 50 TAR containing retroviral vector to enhance the inhibitory effect of the construct (designated TAR-Rib). A human T-cell line (Molt 3) was infected (transduced) with the TAR-Rib recombinant retrovirus and challenged with either HIV- 1 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). HIV- 1 replication was inhibited by 99 % in the TAR-Rib-transduced T cells and was maintained over a 14 -month period, suggesting that this antiviral strategy represses the formation of escape mutants. Interestingly, the TAR-Rib also inhibited SIV replication in transduced T cells, which suggests that polymeric TAR is a general inhibitor of primate lentiviruses; therefore, the macaque model could be used for further in vivo testing of this antiviral gene therapy strategy...|$|R
