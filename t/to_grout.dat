5000|$|John the Deacon, biographer (c. 872) of Pope Gregory I, {{modestly}} {{claimed that}} the saint [...] "compiled a patchwork antiphonary", unsurprisingly, given his considerable work with liturgical development.

According <b>to</b> <b>Grout,</b> {{his goal was to}} organize the bodies of chants from diverse traditions into a uniform and orderly whole for use by the entire western region of the Church. His renowned love for music was recorded only 34 years after his death; the epitaph of Honorius testified that comparison to Gregory was already considered the highest praise for a music-loving pope. While later legends magnified his real achievements, these significant steps may account for why his name came to be attached to Gregorian chant.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to experimentally determine the effectiveness of fracture sealing in welded tuff using ordinary portland cement and microfine cement grouts. Fracture grouting {{will most likely be}} used to seal fractures intersecting high level nuclear waste repositories. Fractures are potential pathways for the migration of radionuclides. Laboratory experiments have been performed on seventeen tuff cylinders. (1) tension induced cracks, (2) natural and, (3) sawcut surfaces serve as fractures. Prior <b>to</b> <b>grouting,</b> the hydraulic conductivity of the intact rock and that of the fractures themselves are measured under a range of normal stresses. Grouts are injected through axial boreholes at pressures of 0. 3 to 4. 1 MPa while holding fractures under a constant normal stress. Five grout formulations have been selected. Minor amounts of bentonite (0 to 5 percent by weight) have been added <b>to</b> these <b>grouts</b> <b>to</b> increase stability. Water to cement ratios range from 0. 45 to 1. 0.
