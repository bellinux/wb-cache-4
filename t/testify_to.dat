5|$|High cliffs, sandbars {{and piles}} of pebbles <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the {{existence}} of strong wave action on the northeastern shore, which was influenced by strong northwesterly winds. Inversely, the gentle southern slopes of the lake bed probably reduced wave action on the lake's southern shores.|$|E

5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> {{the presence}} of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness {{since at least the}} 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th {{century the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia was converted to Christianity {{and had even}} produced its own heretic in Pelagius. Britain sent three bishops to the Synod of Arles in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> a growing Christian presence at least until about 360.|$|E
5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E

5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit. None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from the sculptures that accompanied the Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, Angkor Wat was not {{completely}} abandoned and functioned as a Buddhist temple. Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> Japanese Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which originally located {{in the kingdom of}} Magadha, India. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in 1632.|$|E
5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis to <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Iron Age hillforts <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> {{occupation}} of the area for thousands of years. The village grew up around Dunster Castle which {{was built on the}} Tor by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon (d. post 1090) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. From that time it was the caput of the Feudal barony of Dunster. The Castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries. The benedictine Dunster Priory was established in about 1100. The Priory Church of St George, dovecote and tithe barn are all relics from the Priory.|$|E

5|$|Private {{investigator}} George Newman {{claimed in}} 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony. Commentators {{also noted that}} police and news photographs {{of the crime scene}} did not show Chobert's taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the trial to <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> seeing the taxi, had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared to be dead by the state of New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|The musical {{festivals and}} concerts held {{regularly}} in the Chiquitos formermission towns <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the living heritage of this art form. Some of the original instruments and sculptures made by Fr. Martin Schmid and his apprentices survive in small museums in the mission towns, most notably in Concepción which also houses the music archive. In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco three original harps {{from the time of}} the Jesuits are preserved. The church in Santa Ana de Vealsco also houses the only original organ in Chiquitos, transported there from Potosí by mule, accompanied by Schmid in 1751. More than a dozen orchestras and choirs brought together by the Sistema de Coros y Orquestas (SICOR) dot the area.|$|E
5|$|Genoa was {{important}} {{in the politics of}} 12th-century Europe. The Genoese were a nation of merchants, and such was their wealth that they frequently fulfilled a role as bankers to the other nation states. However, the Genoese became divided following the rift caused when the Emperor Frederick II challenged the power of Pope Innocent IV. Two distinct camps formed: the Guelphs who supported the pope and the Ghibellines who were loyal to the imperial crown. Siding with the Guelphs were one of the patrician families of Genoa—the Grimaldi. Throughout the 13th century these two groups fought. Finally {{at the end of the}} century the Ghibellines were victorious and banished their opponents, including the Grimaldi, from Genoa. The Grimaldi settled in the area today known as the French Riviera. Several castles in the area are still known as Chateau Grimaldi, and <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> the strong presence of various branches of the family in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|The {{allied forces}} of Olaf and Constantine met {{the forces of}} Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh, at a site which {{is the subject of}} much debate, {{although}} current scholarly consensus identifies the site as Bromborough in Cheshire. Olaf and Constantine commanded the Viking troops while Æthelstan alongside his brother Edmund led the English troops into the battle. Contemporary accounts indicate both sides suffered many casualties but the result was a decisive English victory. Olaf and Constantine survived the battle and returned to Ireland and Scotland respectively, however one of Constantine's sons died. The battle is well-attested, with references in Irish chronicles, and a poetic telling of the battle in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The numerous references to it in various chronicles throughout the British Isles <b>testify</b> <b>to</b> its perceived importance at the time.|$|E

He was calmed down and sent home.|$|R
