40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a visualization method that couples a <b>trend</b> <b>chart</b> with word clouds to illustrate temporal content evolutions {{in a set}} of documents. Specifically, we use a <b>trend</b> <b>chart</b> to encode the overall semantic evolution of document content over time. In our work, semantic evolution of a document collection is modeled by varied significance of document content, represented by a set of representative keywords, at different time points. At each time point, we also use a word cloud to depict the representative keywords. Since the words in a word cloud may vary one from another over time (e. g., words with increased importance), we use geometry meshes and an adaptive force-directed model to lay out word clouds to highlight the word differences between any two subsequent word clouds. Our method also ensures semantic coherence and spatial stability of word clouds over time. Our work is embodied in an interactive visual analysis system that helps users to perform text analysis and derive insights from a large collection of documents. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the usefulness and usability of our work. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims to {{highlight}} {{the characteristics of a}} Managerial Control System (MCS) that can better support innovation processes. The topic is not new, but it has been analysed by previous literature mostly from a theoretical perspective. There is, instead, a lack of empirical evidence supporting the different approaches. This study, through the analyses of a sample of Italian firms, tries to contribute in this direction. The sample of this study was chosen from Italian manufacturing firms operating in the sectors with the largest number of registered patents according to the European innovation <b>trend</b> <b>chart.</b> The results show that MCS can enhance product/service innovation but can also inhibit it depending on the role the MCS fosters. MCS can be an obstacle for innovation when limited to pursuing diagnostic functions. On the contrary, product/service innovation is positively associated with an interactive role of MCS. These, although necessary to evaluate business performance, become effective innovation drivers only when they are proposed to stimulate coordination, communication, and learning inside the groups devoted to innovation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between the {{managerial}} control system (MCS) and product/service innovation. The aim is to provide an empirical analysis of the role of an MCS in innovation performance and, more specifically, to highlight the characteristics of an MCS that can better support the development of innovation. We refer to the implementation of formal or informal control mechanisms or, with regard to formal mechanisms, to how they are utilised by distinguishing between diagnostic and interactive use. The sample involved in this study consists of 104 Italian manufacturing firms belonging to those sectors of the Italian economy that feature the largest numbers of registered patents according to the European <b>trend</b> <b>chart</b> on innovation. The results show that an MCS can enhance product/service innovation but it can also inhibit it depending on the role it plays. Indeed, an MCS may hamper innovation if it is limited to pursuing diagnostic functions. Conversely, product/service innovation is positively associated to an interactive use of the MCS. In this case, it is an effective innovation driver capable of stimulating coordination, communication, and learning within innovation teams. The results of this study may have major implications for practitioners. Organisations hoping to enhance their innovation performance should strive to develop an MCS that can blend the monitoring activity with a driver to free thinking and the search for opportunities, while avoiding a strict compliance with rules and regulations, rigid performance evaluation and internal orientation...|$|E
40|$|Elaborating on {{the notion}} {{innovation}} hot spots, we examine {{the case of the}} computer services sector in the Region of Attica, Greece. Fast-growing, geographically and industrially clustered firms are becoming an increasingly important factor for innovation and regional development. As a result, innovation hot spots enjoy rapid growth, leading to job creation, knowledge expansion and, in the best cases, sustainable development. The most recent European <b>Trend</b> <b>Chart</b> Reports (2004 and 2005) present Greece as innovation leader in the computer services sector. Computer services are characterized by a high knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion intensity meaning that the hot spots exploiting such services position high on an innovation intensity scale. Consulting, implementation, operations management and support services enjoy similar growth since they are complementary industries forming the Attica IT innovation hot spot. The purpose of our research within this field is twofold. First, we present the conditions under which this innovation leadership has emerged and come to flourish. We argue that growth in the Region of Attica has been boosted by the Information Society Program, the Olympic Games and the necessity for modernizing Greek firms, which leads them to favor investments in new technologies. Moreover, the region presents a favorable macroeconomic environment, characterized by high rates of development, increase of consumption and investments. Second, we analyze and propose a framework for maintaining the dynamics in the region -and in innovation hot spots in general- as there is a significant risk of rise-and-fall patterns occurring, leading to former hot spots transforming into "blind spots", and core competencies developed turning into core rigidities and cultural lock-in...|$|E

40|$|In any {{iterative}} process, {{without a}} system of measurement, controlled improvement cannot be recorded. This {{is especially true in}} the construction industry, where error occurs, often with fatal repercussions. As part of a process to facilitate the establishment of this metric, an entirely new application was created. The goal of this application is to measure the causal factors that lead to incidents, which will allow the user and administration to track the circumstances and types of incidents. This enables the company to focus on these problem areas and improve through training. By analyzing these incident trends over time, the company can conclude the following: if training reduces the total number of incidents for a given category (identified through these trends), then the corrective action is working. If not, the team must then redefine the problem, {{which is part of the}} aforementioned iterative process. ^ The purpose of this study was to identify a viable metric that captures safety practice improvement over time, and verify that the company’s records indicate a correlation between quantity of incidents recorded and man-hours of exposure decreasing over time. Live server data was provided and a series of queries were performed on relevant tables. These result sets were then placed into a database created by the researcher and manipulated to display trend lines representing incident rates over time, as well as specifically identifying a metric of incident count per month/man-hours per month (companywide). Descriptive statistics were performed, with results indicating that although the reporting process itself was becoming standardized and the latter half of the <b>trend</b> <b>chart</b> showed comparable numbers, there was simply not enough reported data as of yet to provide conclusive evidence on the impact of lean practices as it relates to incidence quantity. It is the researcher’s belief, however, that the data suggests an inverse relationship, as the quantity of human reported incidents had increased as a result of standardized practices and effectively captured more instances that may have likely previously gone unrecorded. ...|$|E
40|$|A perfect {{start is}} a key factor for project {{completion}} on time. The study {{examined the effects of}} delayed mobilization of resources during the initial phases of the project. This paper mainly highlights the identification and categorization of all delays during the initial construction phase and their root cause analysis with corrective/control measures for the Kuwait Oil Company oil and gas projects. A relatively good percentage of the delays identified during the project execution (Contract award to end of defects liability period) attributed to mobilization/preliminary activity delays. Data analysis demonstrated significant increase in average project delay during the last five years compared to the previous period. Contractors had delays/issues during the initial phase, which resulted in slippages and progressively increased, resulting in time and cost overrun. Delays/issues not mitigated on time during the initial phase had very high impact on project completion. Data analysis of the delays {{for the past five years}} was carried out using <b>trend</b> <b>chart,</b> scatter plot, process map, box plot, relative importance index and Pareto chart. Construction of any project inside the Gathering Centers involves complex management skills related to work force, materials, plant, machineries, new technologies etc. Delay affects completion of projects and compromises quality, schedule and budget of project deliverables. Works executed as per plan during the initial phase and start-up duration of the project construction activities resulted in minor slippages/delays in project completion. In addition, there was a good working environment between client and contractor resulting in better project execution and management. Mainly, the contractor was on the front foot in the execution of projects, which had minimum/no delays during the initial and construction period. Hence, having a perfect start during the initial construction phase shall have a positive influence on the project success. Our research paper studies each type of delay with some real example supported by statistic results and suggests mitigation measures. Detailed analysis carried out with all stakeholders based on impact and occurrence of delays to have a practical and effective outcome to mitigate the delays. The key to improvement is to have proper control measures and periodic evaluation/audit to ensure implementation of the mitigation measures. The focus of this research is to reduce the delays encountered during the initial construction phase of the project life cycle...|$|E
