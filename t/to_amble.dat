500|$|In America, the {{political}} atmosphere {{began to change}} and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that [...] "we {{do not believe the}} Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{significant}} number of names for various four-beat intermediate gaits. Though these names derive from differences in footfall patterns and speed, historically they were once grouped together and collectively referred to as the [...] "amble." [...] In the United States horses that are able <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> are referred to as [...] "gaited." [...] In almost all cases, the primary feature of the ambling gaits is that 3 of the 4 feet are on the ground at any time, reflected in the colloquial term, [...] "singlefoot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> off screen and put his {{feet up on the}} seat next to you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying little attention to the most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E

2500|$|An ambling gait or amble is any {{of several}} four-beat {{intermediate}} horse gaits, {{all of which}} are faster than a walk but usually slower than a canter and always slower than a gallop. Horses that amble are sometimes referred to as [...] "gaited," [...] particularly in the United States. [...] Ambling gaits are smoother for a rider than either the two-beat trot or pace and most can be sustained for relatively long periods of time, making them particularly desirable for trail riding and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle. [...] Historically, horses able <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> were highly desired for riding long distances on poor roads. [...] Once roads improved and carriage travel became popular, their use declined in Europe but continued in popularity in the Americas, particularly in areas where plantation agriculture was practiced and the inspection of fields and crops necessitated long daily rides.|$|E
2500|$|Wales' maiden {{appearance}} in the tournament, {{it was also the}} only time all four of the Home Nations qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and Northern Ireland made it past the group stage. The Welsh FA were pessimistic for their prospects, and before the tournament they arranged for five days of training on some free land at Hyde Park and booked the flights home for before the beginning of the knockout stages. Manager Jimmy Murphy used highly defensive tactics, they would prove highly effective as Wales never conceded more than once in any of their five games in the tournament. Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary, Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. Wales had played well against the Hungarians but played poorly against the Mexicans, though they still came close to recording two victories; in the third match both the Swedes and the Welsh were happy <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> to a draw, as that way both sides remained in the competition. As Hungary also recorded three points in the group, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the Råsunda Stadium to advance with a 2–1 win; however due to dirty play from the opposition John Charles was injured in the match and missed out {{on the rest of the}} tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, thanks to a goal by Pelé in the 66th minute – this was only Pelé's second game for his country, and the goal made him the youngest player ever to score in a World Cup game. Charles later recalled that Pelé miskicked the ball, and even in later life it upset him greatly to remember the ball trickling across the line. Pelé himself said that Charles was the best centre-half of the tournament, and the Brazilian swapped shirts with Charles after the game. The Brazilians went on to win the competition. It was a difficult experience for Wales, who were forced to play five highly competitive games in eleven days. Despite their heroics, the competition received little publicity in Britain at the time – the South Wales Evening Post's back page headlined a Glamorgan cricket match – and Charles said in his autobiography that [...] "I don't think many people in Wales even knew the World Cup was on." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps the Count did {{not wish}} to listen to condolences on his defeat, or perhaps he desired to prolong the tete-a-tete with his fair passenger. At any rate, without further hesitation, he struck his weary horse with the whip, causing it <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> forward {{somewhat}} stiffly but at a good pace.|$|E
60|$|Master Gottfried {{was going}} to ride {{as far as the}} {{confines}} of the free city's territory, and his round, sleek, cream-coloured palfrey, used <b>to</b> <b>ambling</b> in civic processions, was as great a contrast to raw- boned, wild-eyed Nibelung, all dappled with misty grey, as was the stately, substantial burgher to his lean, hungry-looking brother, or Dame Johanna's dignified, curled, white poodle, which was forcibly withheld from following Christina, to the coarse-bristled, wolfish- looking hound who glared at the household pet with angry and contemptuous eyes, and made poor Christina's heart throb with terror whenever it bounded near her.|$|R
50|$|Some horses {{can both}} trot and amble, and some horses pace in {{addition}} <b>to</b> the <b>amble</b> instead of trotting. However, pacing in gaited horses is often, though not always, discouraged. Some horses neither trot nor pace easily, but prefer their ambling gait for their standard intermediate speed.|$|R

60|$|The {{ride was}} done all too soon. One should not whirl {{through such a}} choice bit of England in the cars; one should rather wish <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> over the way after a sleepy, contemplative old horse, {{as we used to}} make rural {{excursions}} in New England ere yet railroads were. However, all that's bright must fade, and this among the rest.|$|E
60|$|Her {{memories}} of Roaring Fork {{and its people}} were childish and romantic. She recalled, vividly, the stagecoach which used <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> sedately, not to say wheezily, from the railway to the Fork and from the Fork back to the railway, {{in the days when}} she had ridden away in it a tearful, despairing, long-limbed girl, and fully expected to find it waiting for her at Sulphur City, with old Tom Quentan still as its driver.|$|E
50|$|Smooth-gaited horses, {{generally}} {{known as}} Palfreys, {{existed in the}} Middle Ages, and the Jennet in particular was noted for its ambling gaits. Peruvian Pasos trace their ancestry <b>to</b> these <b>ambling</b> Jennets; {{as well as to}} the Barb, which contributed strength and stamina; and to the Andalusian which added style, conformation and action.|$|R
50|$|Morabs are {{typically}} not gaited. However, due to inherited genetic variation from select Morgan bloodlines {{capable of producing}} gait, a few individual Morabs are able <b>to</b> perform <b>ambling,</b> or intermediate, gaits. The most common intermediate gait in such morabs is the singlefoot, {{also known as the}} 'stepping pace'. Other known gaits are the foxtrot and the true rack.|$|R
5000|$|The horse's gait tends <b>to</b> be more <b>ambling</b> than {{driving at}} the trot, so the horse often {{develops}} a stiff torso & back, making the ride rigid.|$|R
60|$|Old Hucks, still smiling, but dreadfully nervous {{over the}} {{discovery}} of Joe, and Mr. Merrick's sudden activity in the boy's behalf, speedily harnessed Daniel and induced the reluctant steed <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> down {{the path to the}} cabin. Leaning on Uncle John's arm, the invalid walked to the buggy and was assisted to mount to the seat beside Thomas. Then away they started, and, although Dan obeyed Hucks more willingly than any other driver, the Major and Uncle John walked 'cross-lots and reached the hotel a good fifteen minutes in advance of the equipage.|$|E
6000|$|I hesitated--Chu Chu looked {{certainly}} very amiable--I let go. She began <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> {{towards the}} gate, not mincingly as before, {{but with a}} freer and fuller stride. In spite of the incongruous saddle the young girl's seat was admirable. As they neared the gate she cast a single mischievous glance at me, jerked at the rein, and Chu Chu sprang into the road at a rapid canter. I watched them fearfully and breathlessly, until {{at the end of}} the lane I saw Consuelo rein in slightly, wheel easily, and come flying back. There was no doubt about it; the horse was under perfect control. Her second subjugation was complete and final! ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy Skunk {{sat at the}} top of {{the hill}} that overlooks the Green Meadows and watched her out of sight. Then he started <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> down the Lone Little Path to look for some beetles. He was ambling along in his lazy way, for you know he never hurries, when he heard some one puffing and blowing behind him. Of course he turned to see who it was, and he was greatly {{surprised}} when he discovered Old Mr. Toad. Yes, Sir, it was Old Mr. Toad, and he seemed in a great hurry. He was quite short of breath, but he was hopping along in the most determined way as if he were in a great hurry to get somewhere.|$|E

And the Shah of Persia, that ought to have been Muley-on-the-spot for at least three, he's got the palanquin habit. And that funny-hat prince from Korea--wouldn't you think he could afford <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> around on a milk-white palfrey once in a dynasty or two? Nothing doing! His idea of a Balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog- wallows of Seoul in a bull-cart. That's the kind of visiting potentates that come to this country now. It's a hard deal, friend." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} horse's head round to the road, pressed his knees into its sides, {{and then as}} the poor, weary beast started <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> leisurely down the road, Maurice looked back {{for the last time}} on the prostrate, pathetic figure of the lonely man who had given his all for him: he looked at every {{landmark}} which would enable him to find that man again--the angle of the forest where it touched the meadow,--the milestone, the trees by the roadside--oh! he meant to do his duty, to do it well and quickly, to send the conveyance, to neglect nothing; then, with a sigh--half of bitterness, yet full of satisfaction--he finally turned away and looked straight out before him into the distance where Brussels lay, and where the happiness of Crystal's love called to him, and he would find rest and peace in the warm affection of her faithful heart.|$|E
60|$|When the {{ceremony}} was finished, the company were transported in the royal carriages to George Heriot's, where a splendid collation was provided for the marriage-guests in the Foljambe apartments. The king no sooner found himself in this snug retreat, than, casting from him his sword and belt with such haste as if they burnt his fingers, and flinging his plumed hat on the table, as who should say, Lie there, authority! he swallowed a hearty cup of wine to the happiness of the married couple, and began <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> about the room, mumping, laughing, and cracking jests, neither the wittiest nor the most delicate, but accompanied and applauded by shouts of his own mirth, {{in order to encourage}} that of the company. Whilst his Majesty {{was in the midst of}} this gay humour, and a call to the banquet was anxiously expected, a servant whispered Master Heriot forth of the apartment. When he re- entered, he walked up to the king, and, in his turn whispered something, at which James started.|$|E

6000|$|In {{excursions}} of {{this kind}} it is customary to [...] "hobble" [...] the horses; that is, to tie their fore-legs together, so that they cannot run either fast or far, but are free enough <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> about with a clumsy sort of hop in search of food. This is deemed a sufficient check on their tendency to roam, {{although some of the}} knowing horses sometimes learn to hop so fast with their hobbles as to give their owners much trouble to recapture them. But when out in the prairies where Indians are known or supposed to be in the neighbourhood, the horses are picketed by means of a pin or stake attached to the ends of their long laryats, as well as hobbled-- for Indians deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lies, though they think it disgraceful to be found out in doing either. And so expert are these dark-skinned natives of the western prairies, that they will creep into the midst of an enemy's camp, cut the laryats and hobbles of several horses, spring suddenly on their backs, and gallop away.|$|E
60|$|Carl Meredith {{was walking}} with Miranda Pryor, more to torment Joe Milgrave {{than for any}} other reason. Joe was known {{to have a strong}} hankering for the said Miranda, which shyness {{prevented}} him from indulging on all occasions. Joe might summon enough courage <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> up beside Miranda if the night were dark, but here, in this moonlit dusk, he simply could not do it. So he trailed along after the procession and thought things not lawful to be uttered of Carl Meredith. Miranda was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon; she did not share her father's unpopularity but she was not much run after, being a pale, neutral little creature, somewhat addicted to nervous giggling. She had silvery blonde hair and her eyes were big china blue orbs that looked {{as if she had been}} badly frightened when she was little and had never got over it. She would much rather have walked with Joe than with Carl, with whom she did not feel in the least at home. Yet it was something of an honour, too, to have a college boy beside her, and a son of the manse at that.|$|E
60|$|Mme. la Duchesse {{would not}} reply to his questions, {{but after he}} was {{released}} and {{able to stand up}} she made him give her a brief account of his adventure. It had all been so sudden and so quick--he had fallen back a little behind the carriage as soon as the night had set in, as he thought it safer to keep {{along the edge of the}} road. He was feeling tired and drowsy, and allowing his horse <b>to</b> <b>amble</b> along in the slow jog-trot peculiar to its race. No doubt his attention had for some time been on the wander, when, all at once, in the darkness someone seized hold of his horse by the bridle and forced it back upon its haunches. The next moment Maurice felt himself grabbed by the leg, and dragged off his horse: he shouted for help, but the carriage was on ahead and its own rattle prevented the shouts from being heard. After which he was bound and gagged and summarily left to lie by the roadside. He had had no chance against the ruffians, as they were numerous, but they did not attempt to ill-use him in any way.|$|E
