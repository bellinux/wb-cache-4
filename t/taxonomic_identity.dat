5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, Moser sought to clarify the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identity</b> of European fungi by {{collecting}} specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. Moser, working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world. Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to research in this area.|$|E

40|$|Thorough {{assessments}} of fungal diversity are currently hindered by technological limitations. Here we describe a new method for identifying fungi, oligonucleotide fingerprinting of rRNA genes (OFRG). ORFG sorts arrayed rRNA gene (ribosomal DNA [rDNA]) clones into taxonomic clusters {{through a series}} of hybridization experiments, each using a single oligonucleotide probe. A simulated annealing algorithm was used to design an OFRG probe set for fungal rDNA. Analysis of 1, 536 fungal rDNA clones derived from soil generated 455 clusters. A pairwise sequence analysis showed that clones with average sequence identities of 99. 2 % were grouped into the same cluster. To examine the accuracy of the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> produced by this OFRG experiment, we determined the nucleotide sequences for 117 clones distributed throughout the tree. For all but two of these clones, the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> generated by this OFRG experiment were consistent with those generated by a nucleotide sequence analysis. Eighty-eight percent of the clones were affiliated with Ascomycota, while 12 % belonged to Basidiomycota. A large fraction of the clones were affiliated with the genera Fusarium (404 clones) and Raciborskiomyces (176 clones). Smaller assemblages of clones had high sequence identities to the Alternaria, Ascobolus, Chaetomium, Cryptococcus, and Rhizoctonia clades...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{considerable}} amount {{of information on the}} mineralogical characteristics of pedogenic Fe oxides in Brazilian soils, there are few studies on Fe-rich soils developed from mafic rocks with <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> at lower categorical levels. This study evaluated the mineralogical characteristics of pedogenic Fe oxides in B horizons (Bw) of Fe-rich Oxisols developed from several mafic rocks in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The Bw horizons were sampled at a 0. 8 - 1. 0 m depth in 13 Ferric and Perferric Rhodic Oxisols along with a Mesoferric Typic Oxisol originating from basalt, gabbro, tuffite, amphibolite and itabirite in Minas Gerais. The selected soils have <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> up to the fourth categorical level of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification. In the laboratory, the following analyses were made: a) powder X ray diffraction (XRD) of the clay fraction before and after selective concentration of Fe oxides by silicate alkaline dissolution (5 mol L- 1 NaOH); b) selective chemical dissolution of the clay fraction by citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD), acid ammonium oxalate (AAO), and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 1. 8 mol L- 1); c) quantitative estimation of minerals in the clay fraction through allocation of phases from the XRD patterns, magnetic susceptibility of the clay fraction, and quantification of elements after sulfuric acid digestion (H 2 SO 4 1 : 1) of the air-dried fine earth and treatment of the clay fraction with CBD; and d) estimation of the mean crystal size (MCS), specific surface area (SSA), and isomorphic Al-substitution (IS) of hematite, goethite, and maghemite from the XRD patterns obtained from concentrates of Fe oxides. The results showed that estimation of Fe content of maghemite by selective dissolution with 1. 8 mol L- 1 H 2 SO 4 may not be accurate enough to realistically reflect the maghemite contents in the soil sample. The Al content extracted may also be influenced by other minerals that are sources of this element. Hematite crystals were predominantly placoid in shape in all Rhodic Oxisols and had smaller SSA compared to goethite, which showed both isodimensional and asymmetric habit. Higher crystallinity of maghemite and the IS values generally lower than those of hematite and goethite suggest that in well-drained soils derived from mafic rocks, the IS phenomenon in maghemites seems to result from pedogenetic advancement after its formation from magnetite oxidation...|$|R

Some fungal endophytes are {{widespread}} {{and can be found}} in many different plant species, whereas others are highly specific to single hosts. In this study, we investigated the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> and phylogenetic relationships of fungal endophytes isolated from three plant species, Artemisia capillaris, A. indica, and A. lactiflora, using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches. Morphological differences among the fungal isolates indicate that diverse distinct morphotypes might be present within the hosts. Thirty-four fungal isolates were selected for further molecular phylogenetic analysis using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, including both the internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) and the 5. 8 S gene region. The 34 endophytes were identified to various taxonomic levels, and some to the species level based on fungal sequences with known identities in GenBank. Our results suggest that Alternoria, Colletotrichum, Phomopsis, and Xylaria species are the dominant fungal endophytes in the Artemisia hosts, and some of these endophytes exhibit host and tissue specificity.

For the best result, we recommend that the growth conditions for the fungi are carefully standardized. In addition, rigorous replication and control strategies should be employed whether using pre-configured, commercial microwell-plates or in-house designed PM plates for targeted substrate analyses. With these precautions, the PM technique is a valuable tool to characterize the metabolic capabilities of individual endophyte isolates, or successional endophyte communities identified by NGS, allowing a functional interpretation of the taxonomic data. Thus, PM approaches can provide valuable complementary information for NGS studies of fungal endophytes in forest trees...|$|R

Therefore, this study examined the antibiotic resistance of microbial communities of the skin with different exposures to TCS-containing topical products, as well as microbes from soil and sediment. Healthy volunteers were screened and organized into groups based on the use of deodorants, antiperspirants, and body washes that contained TCS or did not. Skin swab samples as well as microbes from environmental samples were cultured and isolates selected for further studies. Isolates were Gram-stained and tested for antibiotic resistance using the Kirby-Bauer method. Their ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were amplified and sequenced to obtain the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities.</b> The trend towards greater resistance was observed among isolates from TCS-exposed skin as well as those from soil and sediment.

Classifying strains of this taxonomic group at species level is a challenging procedure since it is composed of seven species that share among them over 99. 5 % of 16 S rRNA gene identity. In this study, first, a whole-genome in silico approach was used to accurately demarcate B. pumilus group strains, as a case of highly phylogenetically related taxa, at the species level. In order to achieve that and consequently to validate or correct <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> of genomes in public databases, an average nucleotide identity correlation, a core-based phylogenomic and a gene function repertory analyses were performed.

However, the molecular pathways underlying symbiont metabolism {{and the extent}} to which these pathways are expressed in situ are poorly characterized for almost all symbioses. This is largely due to the difficulty of culturing symbionts apart from their hosts. Here, we use pyrosequencing of community RNA transcripts (i. e., the metatranscriptome) to characterize enzymes of dissimilatory sulfur metabolism in the model symbiosis between the coastal bivalve Solemya velum and its intracellular thioautotrophic symbionts. High-throughput sequencing of total RNA from the symbiont-containing gill of a single host individual generated 1. 6 million sequence reads (500 [*]Mbp). Of these, 43, 735 matched Bacteria protein-coding genes in BLASTX searches of the NCBI database. The <b>taxonomic</b> <b>identities</b> of the matched genes indicated relatedness to diverse species of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria, including other thioautotrophic symbionts and the purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium vinosum. Manual querying of these data identified 28 genes from diverse pathways of sulfur energy metabolism, including the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) pathway for sulfur oxidation to sulfite, the APS pathway for sulfite oxidation, and the Sox pathway for thiosulfate oxidation. In total, reads matching sulfur energy metabolism genes represented 7 % of the Bacteria mRNA pool.

The in situ ammonia oxidation rates measured by the 15 N-NO 3 − pool dilution technique in the surface and bottom sediments were 4. 80 and 5. 30  nmol N g − 1  h − 1, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that the archaeal 16 S rRNA genes and amoA genes were present in the range of 0. 128 to 1. 96  [*]×[*]  10 8 and 2. 75 to 9. 80  [*]×[*]  10 5  gene copies g − 1 sediment, respectively, while bacterial amoA was not detected. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA genes showed high sequence similarity to thermophilic Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii, which represented the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTU) in both surface and bottom sediments. The archaeal predominance was further supported by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) visualization. The cell-specific rate of ammonia oxidation was estimated to range from 0. 410 to 0. 790  fmol N archaeal cell − 1  h − 1, higher than those in the two US Great Basin hot springs.
