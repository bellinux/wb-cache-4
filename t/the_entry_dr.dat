40|$|AbstractThe entry at Zhangcun {{coal mine}} in Lu’an coal mining area in Shanxi Province {{suffered}} from severe mining-induced stresses with the heading face driven oppositely to an adjacent working face. In this paper, {{the characteristics of}} deformation and failure of <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> were investigated {{in terms of the}} tempo-spatial relations between heading and working faces through field study and numerical modeling. The three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference models were built to investigate stresses, displacements and damages in the surrounding rocks of <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> and <b>the</b> working face. The field study includes selection of reinforcing methods and materials, design parameters, and determination of cable prestress. The monitoring data of entry deformation and stress along the cables during every stage were presented. The state of <b>the</b> reinforced <b>entry</b> was evaluated based on the monitoring data. The results demonstrate that before the heading face of <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> crosses <b>the</b> adjacent working face, the influence of advanced abutment pressure caused by adjacent working face upon <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> is not significant. After they cross each other, however, the lateral abutment pressure will have an evident impact on <b>the</b> <b>entry.</b> <b>The</b> displacement rate of <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> will be greatly increased and reaches a certain value within a certain distance between the heading face and the working face. Then, it will increase again with the presence of secondary mining-induced pressure on <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> when <b>the</b> present working face advances. The fully-grouted cable with short length, high strength and high prestress is an effective way to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> suffering from severe mining-induced stresses, which greatly reduces the displacement and failure possibility of <b>the</b> <b>entry.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> principles and recommendations for reinforcing design of entries suffering from severe mining-induced stresses were proposed according to field study, numerical modeling and experiences from other coal mines. Problems encountered in field study and suggestions for reinforcement were also discussed...|$|R
