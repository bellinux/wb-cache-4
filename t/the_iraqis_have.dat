In September 2003 he wrote that [...] "most of the assumptions behind our invasion have been proven wrong: The intelligence {{did not support the}} imminence of a threat, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> not broadly welcomed us as liberators, the idea that we could manage this action almost unilaterally is giving way to pleas for troops and money from other nations, the aversion to giving the U.N. a meaningful role is eroding daily, and the reluctance to get involved in nation building is being supplanted by just that." ...|$|E

Blix gave an update of the situation in Iraq, and he stated that the Iraqis were now more proactive in their cooperation. He also rebutted some of the arguments proposed by Powell. Blix questioned the interpretations of the satellite images put forward by Powell, and stated that alternate interpretations of the satellite images were credible. He also stated that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> in fact never received early warning of the inspectors visiting any sites (an allegation made by Powell during his presentation). International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohammed ElBaradei also said that he did not believe <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> a nuclear weapons program, unlike what Powell had claimed.|$|E

50|$|While {{the squad}} evacuates the hostages, Topper enters Saddam's palace and {{runs into the}} {{dictator}} himself, who pulls out his machine pistol and commands Topper to surrender. Topper disarms Saddam, and they engage in a sword fight. President Benson arrives and orders Topper to rescue Dexter while Benson and Saddam continue the duel. Benson defeats Saddam by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, upon which he and his dog solidify and crack into pieces, only to subsequently liquify, combine and reform as Saddam with his dog's head fur, nose and ears. In the meantime, Topper manages to find and liberate Dexter, but is forced to carry him out on his shoulder as <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> tied Dexter's shoelaces together.|$|E

Later, on February 4, 1991, at a male-only sports banquet in Stamford, Connecticut, Kiam told the attendees a crude joke about the incident. Referring to the United States military's use of Patriot missiles during the then-ongoing Gulf War, Kiam said to the audience: [...] "What do <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> in common with Lisa Olson? They've both seen Patriot missiles up close." [...] After criticism, Kiam apologized for the joke two days after he had told it.|$|E

[...] Around {{half of the}} Iraqis are Shī'ā Ithnā 'Asharīs. The Iraqis are {{considered one of the}} biggest Shiite community in the Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> shown remarkable activity and capacity due to the numerous social-religious organizations which have been established by them in the Netherlands. According to the Afghan Imām Moallemzadeh, around half of the Afghans in the Netherlands are Shī'ā Ithnā 'Asharīs Muslims. Despite the fact {{that the majority of the}} Iranian in the Netherlands are Shī'ā Muslims, they are considered as the least religious community in the Netherlands.

5000|$|President Bush {{talks about}} the {{evolution}} of the Iraqi people since the American intervention and overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. He talked about how <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> started down the road of complete independence. They slowly accepted responsibility for organizing their own security once the Americans decide to withdraw, whenever that may be. He also talks about how democracy is slowly taking shape in Iraq thanks to Americans always having a desire to do what is considered [...] "right". At one point during the speech, the President gave thanks to the troops and families of troops stationed all across the world and assured that they would have every resource necessary to succeed overseas. He also reaffirmed {{that as long as the}} Middle East continued to be a place where American resentment was present, America would have a presence there, working to transform the area into one of peace towards the United States.|$|E
50|$|In some ways, the Syrian {{economy has}} benefited from {{the arrival of the}} Iraqis, causing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to go as far as {{crediting}} the refugees for propelling the recovery of the Syrian economy beginning in 2004. According to one of the government's chief economists, Syria's GDP doubled between 2004 and 2010 to $60 billion. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> raised national consumption, invested in Syrian businesses, and stimulated the housing market, while cross border trade has opened up new markets for Syrian industries in Iraq. After the boon to Syrian manufacturing and commercial activity, the Syrian Ministry of Finance reported that unemployment among Syrian citizens had fallen substantially. Yet while the economic indicators suggest Syria {{has benefited from}} the arrival of the Iraqis, the rewards have only been enjoyed by {{a small percentage of the}} population. The costs induced by rising inflation, real estate prices, and demand for subsidized goods has been shouldered by Syrian consumers and the state budget. Prices for groceries and transportation have spiraled upward, while demand has also spiked for electricity, gas, and water. Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell how much Syria's changing economic conditions are directly related to the refugees rather than the state's undergoing structural adjustment programs, market reforms, and decreasing oil revenues. Regardless, Syrian officials still complained in 2007 that the Iraqi refugees had cost the state over $1 billion.|$|E

Although chances are slim, tension is mounting as the national team commence AFC's second round for World Cup qualification. Thailand was seeded in Pot 3 (out of 5) and was drawn to be in Group F along with Iraq, Vietnam, Indonesia and Chinese Taipei (Indonesia was later excluded due to FIFA suspension).Thailand played home against visiting Vietnam on 24 May 2015 as their first World Cup Qualifiers match. Teerasil Dangda, Thailand's renowned striker, once again joined the rank of the national team after his loan with UD Almería ended earlier that year. Thai players dominated the match but were unable to score any goal. Thai defenders were caught off guard twice but were luckily saved by goalkeeper Sinthaweechai Hathairattanakool's sliding tackle both time, well outside of the penalty box. The Vietnamese [...] "stubborn, overly aggressive" [...] performance was rewarded by a red card to Minh Chau Nguyen when he pulled Sarach Yooyen down. Not much later, Pokklaw Anan struck from 20 yards away to give Thailand the victory goal. In a match against Chinese Taipei, Teerasil scored 2 goals {{in the first half}} giving Thailand a 2-0 win.
