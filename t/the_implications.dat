5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology.

40|$|AbstractVarious proof {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to solve <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem, i. e. proving that properties of the form: ∀(P→Q) – where P and Q denote conjunctions of atoms – are logical consequences of logic programs. Nonetheless, it is commonplace {{to say that it}} is still quite a difficult problem. Besides, the advent of the constraint logic programming scheme constitutes not only a major step towards the achievement of efficient declarative logic programming systems but also a new field to explore. By recasting and simplifying <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem in <b>the</b> constraint logic programming (CLP) framework, we define a generic proof method for <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem, which we prove sound from the algebraic point of view. We present four examples using CLP(N), CLP(RT), CLP(Σ∗) and RISC-CLP(R). The logical point of view of the constraint logic programming scheme enables the automation of the proof method. At last, we prove the unsolvability of <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem, we point out the origins of the incompleteness of the proposed proof method and we identify two classes of programs for which we give a decision procedure for <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>implication</b> {{problem is}} to test whether a given set of independencies logically implies another independency. This problem is crucial {{in the design of}} a {{probabilistic}} reasoning system. We advocate that Bayesian networks are a generalization of standard relational databases. On the contrary, {{it has been suggested that}} Bayesian networks are dierent from the relational databases because <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem of these two systems does not coincide for some classes of probabilistic independencies. This remark, however, does not take into consideration one important issue, namely, the solvability of <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem. In this comprehensive study of <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem for probabilistic conditional independencies, it is found that Bayesian networks and relational databases coincide on solvable classes of independencies. The present study suggests that <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> problem for these two closely related systems diers only in unsolvable classes of in-dependencies. This means there is no real dierence between Bayesian networks and relational databases, in the sense that only solvable classes of independencies are useful in the design and implementation of these knowledge systems. More importantly, per-haps, these results suggest that many current attempts to generalize Bayesian networks can take full advantage of the generalizations made to standard relational databases. ...|$|R
