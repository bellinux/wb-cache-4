25|$|Mastopexy by {{internal}} surgical approach applies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> has undergone explantation of breast prostheses. In operative praxis, the plastic surgeon elevates the flaps {{of the cut}} breast-implant capsules, and folds {{them in order to}} increase the volume of the internal mass of the breasts — thereby increasing the projection of the bust from the chest surface. The nipple-areola complex is elevated with plication sutures, and requires no skin resection when there is no excess skin.|$|E

25|$|As Ferrel was docking at the Port of Corpus Christi in Texas on 17 September 1986, Evelyn Langanke {{fell from}} a bridge {{abutment}} near the ship into a 35-foot- (10.7-meter-) deep ship channel. Ferrels executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Ted I. Lillestolen, NOAA Corps, noted that Langanke was in trouble, {{ran from the}} ship, entered the water, and swam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> was thrashing feebly when he reached her. He made a proper lifesaving approach and towed the unconscious woman to shore. Commander Robert E. Hunt, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Paul E. Pegnato, NOAA Corps, both also of Ferrel, came to Langankes medical assistance, with Hunt using cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her and Pegnato administering oxygen and first aid to stabilize her condition. Langanke had suffered a partially collapsed lung, and their rescue and medical actions were crucial in saving her life. For saving and assisting Langanke, the three men received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary Filipinos {{throughout}} the country wore either yellow shirts or held masses for Aquino as their way of paying tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> once led them in a revolution that {{changed the course of}} their country's history. Yellow Ribbons, which were once used during Aquino's battle with Marcos, were tied along major national roads and streets as a sign of solidarity and support for the now deceased Aquino and her grieving family. In popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, Filipinos posted yellow ribbons in their accounts as a tribute to the former Philippine leader. Following her death, Filipino Catholics called on the Church to have Aquino canonized and declared as a saint. During her lifetime, Aquino was known and praised for her strong spirituality and sincere devotion to the Catholic faith. Days after her funeral, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced that it supported calls to put the former President on the 500-Peso banknote alongside her husband, Ninoy Aquino.|$|E
25|$|In December 2001, {{allegations}} were raised that, {{during his time}} as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth had failed to deal appropriately with sex abuse allegations made against a church teacher at Toowoomba Preparatory School. That month, the Brisbane Anglican diocese was ordered to pay $834,800 damages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had {{been found to have}} been sexually abused. Hetty Johnston, an advocate for child sex abuse victims, instigated a campaign calling for Hollingworth to resign. Hollingworth told the Australian media that, as a newly appointed archbishop at the time, he lacked the experience to handle the matter. He also said he had not believed that the case involved sexual abuse, but conceded he had not done enough to stop abuses occurring. Hollingworth subsequently apologised to the Toowoomba victim and released a formal statement condemning child sexual abuse but by February 2002, the Labor Opposition was calling for Hollingworth to be dismissed. Hollingworth stepped down from his positions as the Brisbane Lions' No 1 ticket holder, patron of Barnardos, Kids First Foundation and the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.|$|E

Following speculation that Evans could rejoin his former club, a petition was signed by 150,000 people urging the club not to do so, which stated {{that it would be}} a [...] "deep insult <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist".|$|E
500|$|Debbie Rowe met Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s, {{while working}} as an {{assistant}} for the pop star's dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and he invited me to his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E

60|$|Little {{was said}} at first, for the {{hopelessness}} of their condition seemed {{so obvious that}} the men shrank from expressing their gloomy fears <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> sat huddled together, wet and cold, {{in the bottom of}} the boat.|$|R
2500|$|On January 30, 1956, Coretta and Dexter {{congregation}} member Roscoe Williams's wife Mary Lucy {{heard the}} [...] "sound of a brick striking {{the concrete floor}} of the front porch." [...] Coretta suggested that the two women {{get out of the}} front room and went into the guest room, as the house was disturbed by an explosion which caused the house to rock and fill the front room with smoke and shattered glass. The two went {{to the rear of the}} home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> answered the phone. Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns.

Lady Janet could do rigid justice--but hers was not the heart to give itself to a stranger (and to give itself unreservedly) a second time. Grace Roseberry would be formally acknowledged--and there it would end.|$|E
