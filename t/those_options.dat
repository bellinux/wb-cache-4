500|$|Philosophy {{professor}} Michael Huemer says [...] "that {{the only}} way the otherwise predetermined future seen by the precogs can be averted, we are led to believe, is by the influence of the precogs themselves." [...] He argues that their [...] "knowledge of their would-be future" [...] enables them to make changes to prevent its occurrence. This means that Howard Marks, the arrested potential killer from the film's opening scene, is destined to his fate and no action he could undertake would change it. Individuals with minority reports however, have a chance to change their futures according to Huemer, and since there was no minority report (i.e.; no possible alternative fate) for Anderton, he could only change his future by having access to the precogs' visions. Huemer compares the humans situation to that of a robot; since a robot controls itself, but has a set number of programmed actions, its fate falls within those actions. It lacks free will {{in the sense that it}} cannot choose any action outside of its programming, even if one may exist. He also considers a decaying atom which has a 50% chance of survival within the next hour, since the atom has no actions which it can undertake to change those odds, its fate is pure chance. Thus he believes a person needs a set of options, the knowledge of <b>those</b> <b>options,</b> and the ability to choose between them to have free will.|$|E

The book discussed the way in which two categories where juxtaposed in the Israeli discourse - one which distinguishes Jews from non-Jews, and another, which is perceived as an exclusively Jewish discourse, between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi. Shenhav seeks to undermine those categories, which he believes to be fixated and do not allow a description of Mizrahi history from a comparative perspective.|$|E

The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters {{are going to get a}} chance to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to military operations, called Anticipatory Planning and Adaptive Execution, treats planning and execution as a tightly coupled, single process, and replaces reaction to events with anticipation of events. The Anticipatory Planning process accounts for the chaotic nature of warfare in which possibilities appear and disappear. With new information technologies, military planners {{should be able to}} plan faster and better. An Anticipatory Planning Support System has been designed and implemented to provide an automated mechanism for assisting commanders and their staff in producing plans and evaluating scenarios. The APSS provides the human planners with an interactive visual development system to build Plan Descriptions around Nodes that represent option points in the plan and the Branches that represent the transitions between <b>those</b> <b>option</b> points. The APSS uses underlying simulations to assist in plan construction and evaluation. For testing or training purposes, an extern [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} option model composition. Option models are temporal abstractions that, like macro-operators in classical planning, jump directly from a start state to an end state. Prior work has focused on constructing option models from primitive actions, by intra-option model learning; or on using option models to construct a value function, by inter-option planning. We present a unified view of intra- and inter-option model learning, based on a major generalisation of the Bellman equation. Our fundamental operation is the recursive composition of option models into other option models. This key idea enables compositional planning over many levels of abstraction. We illustrate our framework using a dynamic programming algorithm that simultaneously constructs optimal option models for multiple subgoals, and also searches over <b>those</b> <b>option</b> models to provide rapid progress towards other subgoals.

40|$|We find three {{intertwined}} ambitions {{that drove}} federal legislation over wildlife and biodiversity {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th Century: establishment of multiple-use federal lands, the economic development of natural resources, and the maintenance of option values. We examine this federal intervention in natural resource use by analyzing roll-call votes over the past century. These votes involved decisions regarding public land that reallocated the returns to users by changing the asset's physical character or its usage rights. We suggest that long term consequences affecting current resource allocations arose from disparities between broadly dispersed benefits and locally concentrated socio-economic and geophysical (spatial) costs. We show that a primary intent of public land management has become to preserve multiple-use option values and identify important factors in computing <b>those</b> <b>option</b> values. We do this by demonstrating how the willingness to forego current benefits for future ones depends on the community's resource endowments. These endowments are defined not only in terms of users' current wealth accumulation but also from their expected ability to extract utility from natural resources over time...|$|R
