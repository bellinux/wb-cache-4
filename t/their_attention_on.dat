5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{trying to create a}} real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|On 25 and 26 May, the Luftwaffe focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Allied pockets {{holding out}} at Calais, Lille, and Amiens, {{and did not}} attack Dunkirk. Calais, held by the BEF, {{surrendered}} on 26 May. Remnants of the French First Army, surrounded at Lille, fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender, having run out of food and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception. Afraid {{that she might be}} sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.|$|E
50|$|The twins married brothers, Jim (who married Lyn in 1942) and Tom Cathcart (who married Lee February 22, 1947, in Michigan City, Indiana). They focused <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> family life, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} in show business, but they retained {{a love of}} music.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} and {{throughout}} the early 1970s, Stavers was encountering fierce competition from other teen magazines such as Tiger Beat. She also had competition from other journalists now focusing <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> the rock music scene such as Patricia Kennealy and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine.|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} paper, F. YIN et al. analyze {{and develop a}} {{mathematical}} model to evaluate {{the performance of the}} contention-based and delay-tolerant applications in IEEE 802.16 networks. They focus <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> allocating the uplink bandwidth efficiently; the basic goal is to optimize the performance with an optimal bandwidth allocation mechanism.|$|R
5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, with parents focusing <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
5|$|The Justice Department and the FBI {{began by}} {{investigating}} possible criminal actions by Keating and John Granger, but then expanded its inquiries {{to include the}} five senators. The FBI soon focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Cranston, because the largest sums of money from Keating came into Cranston-involved voter-registration drives whose tax-exempt status might have been violated.|$|E
5|$|The King gave Sutton Valence to William de Valence, his half-brother, who had {{supported}} {{him during the}} conflict. Under William, the castle acquired its current name of Sutton Valence. Aymer de Valence, his son, inherited the castle in 1307. The Valences travelled around their estates, increasingly focusing <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> a handful of their various great houses, and stayed at Sutton Valence on at least several occasions.|$|E
50|$|The {{team won}} the {{national}} WPSL Championship in its only season of existence, beating Chicago Red Stars 2-1 after extra time in the final. Rogers was named Coach of the Year. In December 2011 the team's owners withdrew funding from Orange County Waves, in order to focus <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> Bay Area Breeze.|$|R

50|$|Nick soon befriends Duncan Stewart (Brendan McKensy) {{and they}} begin causing havoc together. When Nick {{is accused of}} {{throwing}} stones at Duncan's aunt, Celia (Fiona Spence), they get into a fight but later reconcile their friendship and focus <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> the newly arrived Sutherland twins Jade (Kate Garven) and Kirsty (Christie Hayes), {{who are in their}} year at school. Duncan dates Jade while Nick dates Kirsty.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|Jean {{was one of}} {{the writers}} and {{producers}} who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film that was released in 2007. The show's voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers of The Simpsons were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect on}} the show, as they did not have enough crew to focus <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> both projects. As the show progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E

2500|$|Succeeding where earlier armies had failed, Bonaparte and his {{soldiers}} knocked Sardinia {{out of the}} war in a single brief campaign. The French suffered 6,000 casualties during the campaign. Total Austrian and Sardinian losses stood around 25,000. With Sardinia-Piedmont pacified, the French were free to direct <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> major enemy, Austria. [...] Soon Bonaparte launched a new offensive, which resulted in victories over Beaulieu at the battles of Fombio and Lodi in May.|$|R
50|$|Suffragists, {{knowing that}} women's {{suffrage}} could not succeed without support, put their {{hope in the}} Equal Rights Association and pushed for a campaign for universal suffrage. From April until November 1867, women furiously campaigned, distributing thousands of pamphlets and speaking in numerous locations for the cause. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton focused <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> New York, while Stone and Blackwell headed to Kansas, where the November election would be taking place.|$|R
5|$|The 11th Army gained ground during mid-June, {{focusing}} <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{the northern}} {{approaches to the}} city. Casualties were high on both sides as the month dragged on. Aware {{of the need to}} act before the German summer offensive of 1942 reduced the availability of reinforcements and supplies, Manstein ordered a surprise attack using amphibious landings across Severnaya Bay on 29 June. The operation was a success; Soviet resistance crumbled. On 1 July German forces entered the city while the Soviet forces conducted a disorganised evacuation, and Hitler promoted Manstein to Generalfeldmarschall the same day. The entire city was in German hands by 4 July.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E
5|$|Billy Talent II hit {{the shelves}} on June 27, 2006. It fared {{very well in}} Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed {{significant}} success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, {{and was one of}} the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they know they are a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.|$|E

25|$|The second {{continuum}} reflects {{what people}} focus <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on.</b> Sensing types enjoy a learning {{environment in which}} the material is presented in a detailed and sequential manner. Sensing types often attend to what is occurring in the present, and can move to the abstract after they have established a concrete experience. Intuitive types prefer a learning atmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on meaning and associations. Insight is valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for intuitive types.|$|R
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Soviet Union and Lithuania {{escalated}} along with Germany's successes. By mid-March 1940, the Winter War with Finland {{was over and}} the Soviets could concentrate <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> gaining control of the Baltic states. In April, after Germany occupied Denmark, a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats. During May, while the Battle of France was in full swing, the Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure. On May 16, shortly after the German invasion of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Soviet official newspaper Izvestia published an article warning that it was naive for a small country to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival. Between May 18 and May 25, Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from Vilnius to Gaižiūnai, a location {{much closer to the}} government seat in Kaunas. The action's proximity to the then-capital carried symbolic weight.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E

30|$|While {{directing}} <b>their</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> architecting {{a planning}} model for {{transmission of data}} to the cloud that is cost-effective, Cho et al. (2010) have designed Pandora. Later, these authors {{have gone on to}} propose a solution to curb transmission latency under budget constraints (Cho and Gupta 2011). Their study differs from ours in that they lay emphasis on fixed volume data transfer which is static, rather than data that is produced dynamically. Further, they have considered a single-cloud measure, whereas our study involves more than one data hub.|$|R
5|$|While {{fighting}} raged {{inside the}} district, all flyable aircraft from the 118th Aviation Company flew out from Biên Hòa to Phước Vinh, {{a small town}} about 30 kilometres from Đồng Xoài. From Phước Vinh the first contingent of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was airlifted into the battlefield. At around 8am, the UH-1 formations of the 118th Aviation Company descend on the landing zone near the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation, about 4 kilometres north of Đồng Xoài; they immediately began to receive fire from bunkers and foxholes surrounding the area. The South Vietnamese command believed the landing zone near Thuận Lợi would be ideal to land their troops, because it was distant enough that the Viet Cong would not find and engage them immediately. However, the Viet Cong had anticipated the South Vietnamese would land troops in the area, and had prepared for an ambush. As a result, after U.S. helicopters had departed from the landing zone, soldiers of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment immediately turned <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the South Vietnamese. Within 15 minutes {{the main body of}} the ARVN 1st Battalion was completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|With dawn nearing, Adan {{realized}} that if the pontoon bridge could not {{be brought to the}} canal during the few remaining hours of dark, an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across the canal, and in daylight, the paratroopers would sustain more casualties. He sent a half-track company to reconnoiter Akavish at 3:00. Half an hour later, the company reported it had reached the crossing site without encountering any resistance. The Egyptian battalion fighting the paratroopers had focused all <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the Israelis at Tirtur, ignoring activity on Akavish. Adan took a risky decision, sending the irreplaceable pontoons down Akavish to the canal. IDF bulldozers cleared the road of wreckage and debris, and the Israelis reached Fort Lakekan before turning northwards, finally reaching the crossing site. Bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of the 143rd Division.|$|E
5|$|In 483BC, {{a massive}} new seam of silver {{was found in}} the Athenian mines at Laurium. Themistocles {{proposed}} that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the Athenian citizens. Themistocles avoided mentioning Persia, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Aegina. At the time, Athens was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea. As a result, Themistocles's motion was carried easily, although only 100 warships of the trireme type were to be built. Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely Themistocles was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built. Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the ostracism of 482BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what has been characterized as the first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles's policies were endorsed. Indeed, becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than Themistocles had initially asked for. In the run up to the Persian invasion, Themistocles had thus become the foremost politician in Athens.|$|E
