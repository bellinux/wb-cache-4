40|$|ABSTRACT: Dialkylthio-substituted thienyl-benzodithio-phene (BDT-DST) was {{designed}} and synthesized as a building block to modulate <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>the</b> conjugated polymers, and three copolymers named PDST-BDD, PDST-TT and PDST-DPP were prepared and applied in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Theoretical calculations and electro-chemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement suggested that the dialkylthio group could decrease <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> energy <b>levels</b> of <b>the</b> resulting polymers distinctly. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) of PSC devices based on PDST-BDD, PDST-TT, and PDST-DPP are as high as 1. 0, 0. 98, and 0. 88 V, respectively, which are ∼ 0. 15 V {{higher than those of}} the corresponding alky-substituted analogues. Moreover, the influence of the dialkylthio group on the absorption spectra, crystalline properties, hole mobilities, and blend morphologies of the polymers was also investigated. The results indicate that the dialkythio substitution is an effective method to modulate <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> energy <b>levels</b> and that the BDT-DST unit has potential for constructing high-efficiency photovoltaic polymers...|$|R

5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>level.</b> Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>level</b> for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>level.</b> While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of {{molecular}} biology, and with it {{an understanding of the}} chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, arguing that—at <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>level</b> at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} transport characteristics of molecular junctions, where first-row diatomic molecules are attached to (001) gold and platinum electrodes. We find that the conductance {{of all of these}} junctions is of the order of the conductance quantum unit $G_ 0 $, spelling out that they belong to the transparent regime. We further find that the transmission coefficients show wide plateaus {{as a function of the}} energy, instead of the usual sharp resonances that signal <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> tunneling regime. We use Caroli's model to show that this is a rather generic property of the transparent regime of a junction, which is driven by a strong effective coupling between <b>the</b> delocalized <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> and <b>the</b> conduction channels at the electrodes. We analyse the transmission coefficients and chemical bonding of gold/Benzene and gold/Benzene-dithiolate (BDT) junctions to understand why the later show large resistances, while the former are highly conductive.

40|$|In {{transport}} calculations for molecular junctions {{based on}} density functional theory {{the choice of}} exchange and correlation functional may dramatically affect the results. In particular local and semi-local functionals tend to over-delocalize <b>the</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> thus artificially increasing their broadening. In addition <b>the</b> same <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> are usually misplaced {{with respect to the}} Fermi level of the electrodes. These shortfalls are reminiscent of the inability of local functionals to describe Mott-Hubbard insulators, but they can be corrected with a simple and computationally undemanding self-interaction correction scheme. We apply such a scheme, as implemented in our transport code Smeagol, to a variety of phenyl-based molecular junctions attached to gold electrodes. In general the corrections reduce the current, since the resonant Kohn-Sham states of the molecule are shifted away from the contact Fermi level. In contrast, when the junction is already described as insulating by local exchange and correlation potentials, the corrections are minimal and the I-V is only weakly modified.
