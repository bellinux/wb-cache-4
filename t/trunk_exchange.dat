These alterations necessitated the re-arrangement of window and door openings. The building underwent further alterations, including those in 1901, when the telephone exchange opened, and those in 1954 when the Post Master's residence was transformed into a new telephone <b>trunk</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first System X unit {{to enter}} public service was in September 1980 and was {{installed}} in Baynard House, London and was a tandem junction unit which switched telephone calls amongst around 40 local exchanges. The first local digital exchange started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last electromechanical <b>trunk</b> <b>exchange</b> (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990 - completing the UK's trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical local exchanges, Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.|$|E
40|$|Creating complex systems, and {{to assess}} {{the quality of their}} {{functioning}} and disability involves solving a wide range of diverse tasks. Moreover, the intensive use of computer technology and automation in them constantly corrects views on these systems, which include also the support system decision. Improving the quality and reducing the time of decision making in the management of complex systems for various purposes is currently impossible without the development of effective software and hardware that provide activities staff. Particularly acute is the problem when making decisions (MD) in complex systems technical protection (CSTP) working in real time, where the lack of time is felt particularly strongly, and consequences of untimely or incorrect decision making can be catastrophic. In this regard, and there is a need in the application of decision support systems (DSS), whose main task is to assist professionals in making rational and optimal solutions to complex situations that arise in the operation CSTP in real time. Moreover, the quality assessment of choice making and their parameters must be based on models that would assess the application of the same system in different conditions. Improving mathematical modeling CSTP can be achieved through simulation of complex systems and subsystems that make up its membership. This agreement encourages the development of models and algorithms that allow solving complex management tasks system. Therefore synthesis CSTP and DSS for them, based on computer technology, must be carried out according to known criteria: firmware control, modular construction; <b>trunk</b> <b>exchange</b> of information, the ability to increase processing power. Development and study of mathematical models CSTP and DSS requires significant time and resources. Therefore, the use of Petri nets (PN) for such purposes accelerates the resolution of these problems. The aim of the work is to examine the possibility of using IM to evaluate the technical condition CSTP and DSS, and assessing the quality of their operation in different operating conditions. According to the purpose, structure and Duties DSS is an integral part KSTZ real time. Therefore, the question of synthesis DSS should be considered with regard to interaction with the DSS algorithms algorithms functioning CSTP. For modern control systems CSTP working in real time, the most typical is a three-tier structure of computational tools. On the first level there is a universal computer that has a large amount of memory in a second - specialized computers (mini-or micro - computers) on the third - personal computers in the ECM or control object machine. Implementation of DSS in CSTP does not change the basic functions of computational tools associated with the formation of the information model.

To evaluate the effectiveness of DSS in the CSTP to simulate the process of work. Its main goals - clarifying technical solution on the choice of computer technology and the distribution of functions between them, checking consistency of functioning hardware DSS, evaluation of DSS and CSTP in general. Thus, the device allows you to build MCHMP fairly complete model of the algorithms that reflect their structure, logic and temporal characteristics. For efficient use of a wide range of hardware capabilities of Petri nets (HPN) required the establishment of a special HPN system of software with a set of descriptions, input translation, layout, debugging, simulation models, process simulation results and analysis. One way to achieve a compromise between complexity and reliability of the mathematical model is simplified equivalent network facilities, conducted by route of the system based on fuzzy relations in space, caused expandable base dividend CSTP and DSS. Route model of the probability that the advance is given, allows to predict the dynamics of the events surrounding CSTP taking into account the DSS and their condition. The use of Petri nets for simulation algorithms in the DSS CSTP is that each block diagram of the algorithm is associated with Petri nets. Movement marks it simulates the process of calculations performed by algorithms. The proposed method allows to predict the technical condition and operation CSTP and DSS based on systematic evaluations with high accuracy, which ensures the necessary level of security...|$|E

40|$|Preservation permittingpatterns of {{developmental}} evolu-tion can be reconstructed within long extinct clades, {{and the rich}} fossil record of trilobite ontogeny and phylogeny provides an unparalleled opportunity for doing so. Furthermore, knowledge of Hox gene expression pat-terns among living arthropods permit inferences about possible Hox gene deployment in trilobites. The trilobite anteroposterior body plan is consistent with recent suggestions that basal euarthropods had a relatively low degree of tagmosis among cephalic limbs, possibly related to overlapping expression domains of cephalic Hox genes. Trilobite trunk segments appeared sequen-tially at a subterminal generative zone, and were ex-changed between regions of fused and freely articulating segments during growth. Homonomous trunk segment shape and gradual size transition were apparently phylogenetically basal conditions and suggest a single trunk tagma. Several derived clades independently evolved functionally distinct tagmata within the <b>trunk,</b> apparently <b>exchanging</b> flexible segment numbers for greater regionally autonomy. The trilobite trunk chro-nicles how different aspects of arthropod segmenta-tion coevolved as the degree of tagmosis increased...|$|R

The <b>trunks</b> connecting the <b>exchanges</b> are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used {{to connect the}} last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical {{phone call from a}} calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.|$|R

40|$|Scarce water {{resources}} mainly in arid and semi-arid areas have caused an increasing interest for applying irrigation protocols aiming to reduce water spends. The effects of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) {{on the performance}} of apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L. cv. “Búlida”) were assessed in Murcia (SE Spain), during three consecutive growing seasons (2008 - 2010). The hypothesis was that RDI would not restrict yield but increase fruit quality while saving water. Two irrigation treatments were established: i) control, irrigated to fully satisfy crop water requirements (100 % ETc) and ii) RDI, that reduced the amount of applied water to: a) 40 % of ETc at flowering and stage I of fruit growth; b) 60 % of ETc during the stage II of fruit growth and c) 50 % and 25 % of ETc during the late postharvest period (from 60 days after harvest). Stem water potential, gas <b>exchanges,</b> <b>trunk</b> cross-sectional area (TCSA), fruit diameter, yield and fruit quality traits were determined. Vegetative growth was decreased by the use of RDI (12 % less TCSA on average for the three years), whereas yield was unaffected. In addition, some qualitative characteristics of the fruits, such as the level of soluble solids, sweetness/acidity relation and fruit colour, were improved by the use of RDI. These results and average water savings of approximately 30 %, lead us to conclude that RDI strategies are a possible solution for irrigation management in areas with water shortages, such as arid and semi-arid environments...|$|R
