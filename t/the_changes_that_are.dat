2500|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> made by Tate are {{a result}} of Restoration ideas of the time. Tate's play was popular in the 1680s, after the {{restoring}} of the monarchy after the Interregnum. This time is known as the Restoration and there were specific tastes and ideas about theatre at this time due to the political and social climate which influenced the changes Tate made. James Black supports this claim by stating, [...] "The Restoration stage was often an extension of the real-life political and philosophical milieu." [...] Tate chose to draw upon politics and restore Lear to his throne just as Charles II was restored as the English monarch making the play more topical and relatable with audiences at the time. Not only can Tate's restoring Lear to the throne be justified by Restoration sensibilities but the addition of the love story between Cordelia and Edgar, and the omission of the Fool are also the result of Restoration ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Systems biology {{approaches}} to Alzheimer’s disease that consider the biochemical pathways {{that are important}} in CNS disease evolution have been developed by research that was funded outside NASA. Figure 6-8 shows a schematic of the biochemical pathways {{that are important in}} the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued. Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros [...] have developed an in silico model of senile plaques that are related to Alzheimer’s disease. In this model, the biochemical interactions among TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 are described within several important cell populations, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Further, in this model soluble amyloid causes microglial chemotaxis and activates IL-1B secretion. Figure 6-9 shows the results of the Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros model simulating plaque formation and neuronal death. Establishing links between space radiation-induced changes to <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> described in this approach can be pursued to develop an in silico model of Alzheimer’s disease that results from space radiation.|$|E

The distance was less than a league; and, as yet, there was not much show on the rocks.
