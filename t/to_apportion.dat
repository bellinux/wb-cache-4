5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E

5000|$|After Pollock, while {{income taxes}} on wages (as {{indirect}} taxes) were still not required <b>to</b> be <b>apportioned</b> by population, taxes on interest, dividends, and rental income were required <b>to</b> be <b>apportioned</b> by population.

5|$|The 503rd Parachute Infantry {{lost three}} men killed and 33 {{injured in the}} jump. Another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against the Japanese, and 26 were {{evacuated}} sick. The 2/5th Field Ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 September. Between 5 and 19 September, the 7th Division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded, while another 138 were evacuated sick. To this must be added the 11 Americans and 59 Australians killed and 92 Australians injured in the air crash at Jackson's Airfield. Thus, 119 Allied servicemen were killed, 241 wounded or injured, and 166 evacuated sick. Japanese casualties were estimated at 2,200, but it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> them between the 7th and 9th Divisions.|$|E

He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E
5|$|The Inclosure Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell. Commissioners {{were appointed}} to settle claims in land and <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> Gateshead Fell accordingly. Plans were laid for the requisition {{and construction of}} wells (including Carter's Well; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque), quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, {{but by the time}} of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history. The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled, so that the villages created by enclosure have survived, almost entirely intact, to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

25|$|Nothing in the Sixteenth Amendment or in Brushaber (and {{the other}} cases {{interpreting}} the tax {{provisions of the}} U.S. Constitution) changes the general rule that direct taxes are still required <b>to</b> be <b>apportioned</b> among the states by population.

25|$|The {{liability}} of West Virginia is a deepseated equity, not discharged {{by changes in}} the form of the debt, nor split up by the unilateral attempt of Virginia <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> specific parts to the two states.

25|$|Prior to 1895, {{all income}} taxes had been {{considered}} indirect taxes (not required <b>to</b> be <b>apportioned</b> among the states according to the population of each state).

This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one year}} after the accident, on 15 July 2011, the Security Council of Aeronáutica Civil {{concluded}} that the cause of the accident was the execution of the final approach below the glide path, due to an error of judgment by the crew who believed they were much higher. This is typical of a “black hole” illusion, which is experienced during a night approach to a low contrast runway environment surrounded by bright lights, aggravated by heavy rain. Aeronaútica Civil recommended retraining of the crew.

25|$|The Acting Governor {{soon found}} {{himself with a}} major problem. Under {{territorial}} law at the time, the legislature was empowered <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> itself. In practice the apportionment had been delegated to the governor. In January 1869, Judge Henry T. Backus issued a ruling that this arrangement was unconstitutional. As a result, {{the legality of the}} territorial government was thrown into question, and some residents refused to pay their taxes. Carter called for the United States Congress, in its supervisory capacity, to pass legislation correcting the issue. While the needed legislation was passed, it did not come until after Carter left office. In the meantime, the Acting Governor failed to call for a meeting of the territorial legislature in 1869. This oversight may have been partially due to Carter experiencing another bout of health problems. He did commute the death sentence of Delore Moore who had been convicted of killing her husband.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn, later {{known as}} Llywelyn the Great, was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200, {{and made a}} treaty with King John of England the same year.

He married John's illegitimate daughter Joan, also known as Joanna, in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys in 1208 Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210 relations deteriorated and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all his lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover these lands the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216 he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year <b>to</b> <b>apportion</b> lands to the other princes.|$|E

Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, {{and says that}} Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy.
