5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks {{to either the}} head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck {{in order to avoid}} an opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right against resistance.|$|E

5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right, the character will bail and {{need a few}} seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

25|$|Since {{only the}} {{connection}} information is relevant, {{the shape of}} pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself. Only the existence (or absence) of an edge between each pair of nodes is significant.

50|$|The {{worst case}} runtime is {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> runtime of Borůvka's algorithm.

5000|$|Since R is {{a module}} over itself, S {{may be taken}} to be a subset of R itself, and since R is both a right and a <b>left</b> R module, <b>the</b> {{notation}} must be modified slightly <b>to</b> indicate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>or</b> right side.

25|$|Trémaux trees {{also play}} a key role in the Fraysseix–Rosenstiehl {{planarity}} criterion for testing whether a given graph is planar.

25|$|Conversion between {{different}} scientific notation {{representations of the}} same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part.

25|$|Generally, if in doubt, {{the side}} of a coin with the larger-scale image will be called the obverse (especially if the image is a single head) and, if that does not serve to {{distinguish}} them, the side that is more typical {{of a wide range of}} coins from that location will be called the obverse. A convention now exists typically to display the obverse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> (<b>or</b> above) and the reverse to the right (or below) in photographs and museum displays, but this is not invariably observed.|$|E
