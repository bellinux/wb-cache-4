500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: Imagine if {{you were able to}} have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E

When an {{infinite}} continued fraction converges, the corresponding sequence {Τn} of LFTs [...] "focuses" [...] {{the plane in}} the direction of x, the value of the continued fraction. At each stage of the process a larger and larger region of the plane is mapped into a neighborhood of x, and the smaller and smaller region of the plane that's left over is stretched out ever more thinly to cover everything outside that neighborhood.|$|E

6000|$|He {{could not}} use his friend {{even as a}} {{messenger}} without telling him something of the truth. [...] "When I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> injustice, I can hardly hold myself. He proposes to give me twenty-five thousand pounds." ...|$|R

60|$|When {{you come}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> was an {{embarrassing}} question, especially for Carey, who had believed that Tannis understood the game, and played it for its own sake, as he did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sanpritchit's a queer {{place to}} have {{business}} in," [...] said Captain Jabe; [...] "and it's a pity ye didn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> mornin', when ye might have gone with me and took the train to Barley, and there's a stage from there to Sanpritchit." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{history of}} the {{interval}} which I thus pass over must remain unrecorded. My heart turns faint, my mind sinks in darkness and confusion when I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> must not be, if I who write am to guide, as I ought, you who read. This must not be, if the clue that leads through the windings {{of the story is}} to remain from end to end untangled in my hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> for <b>this</b> {{again is}} wonderful! That these {{children}} of Montrose {{should have an}} element of music in their souls which Homer had not,--which a melos of David the Prophet and King had not,--which Orpheus and Amphion had not,--which Apollo's unrymed oracles became mute at the sound of.|$|R
6000|$|... 52 205. Well-meaners {{think no}} harm. Compare the famous epigram {{adopted by the}} Order of the Garter: [...] "honi soit qui mal y pense" [...] (shamed be he who <b>thinks</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>it).</b> <b>This</b> order was founded during Chaucer's life, and this {{sentiment}} {{may have been in}} his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "We did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until <b>this</b> morning early, {{though we}} have been rather curious over it ourselves. When we opened it, inside was another letter {{addressed}} 'To be delivered to John Thorndyke, Esquire, at Crawley, near Hastings, or at Crowswood, Reigate, or {{in the event of}} his death to his executors.'" ...|$|R
60|$|It is puzzling, {{when you}} come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> {{estimate}} accorded by the general public to the litterateur. It stands to reason that the man who writes books, explaining everything and putting everybody right, must be himself an exceptionally clever man; else how could he do it! The thing is pure logic. Yet to listen to Robina and her like you might think we had not sense enough to run ourselves, as the saying is--let alone running the universe. If I would let her, Robina would sit and give me information by the hour.|$|E
60|$|Now {{all this}} has little enough {{to do with what}} I took my pen up to tell about; but when a man has a good memory and little skill, he cannot draw one thought from his mind without a dozen others {{trailing}} out behind it. And yet, now that I come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> {{had something to do with}} it after all; for Jim Horscroft had so deadly a quarrel with his father, that he was packed off to the Berwick Academy, and as my father had long wished me to go there, he took advantage of this chance to send me also.|$|E
6000|$|... "No? Well, then I {{shall make}} a point of sending you a copy. The Speech on the French Revolution--The American Rebellion? Which shall it be, I wonder?" [...] He noted {{something}} in his pocket-book. [...] "And then you must write {{and tell me what you}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> reticence--this isolation--that's what's the matter with modern life! Now, tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations? I should imagine that you were a person with very strong interests. Of course you are! Good God! When I think of the age we live in, with its opportunities and possibilities, the mass of things to be done and enjoyed--why haven't we ten lives instead of one? But about yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I wouldn't, myself. Poultry is one {{of those}} things which no person can get to the bottom of, there is so much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and such variety. It is just wings, and wings, and wings, till you are weary: turkeys, and geese, and bats, and butterflies, and angels, and grasshoppers, and flying-fish, and--well, there is really no end to the tribe; it gives me the heaves just to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> But <b>this</b> one hasn't any wings, has he?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{must really}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>It</b> is no mere {{question}} <b>of</b> words, <b>it</b> is a solemn practical question, {{which has to}} do with our every-day conduct, and yet which goes down to the deepest of all matters, even to the depths of God himself.|$|R
6000|$|All the same, {{even when}} I'm at my very piousest, it puts me out if my {{drawings}} go wrong. I'm {{going to draw}} St. Ursula's blue slippers to-day, and if I can't do them nicely shall be in great despair. I've just found a little cunning inscription on her bedpost, 'IN FANNTIA.' The double N puzzled me at first, but Carpaccio spells anyhow. My head {{is not good enough}} for a bedpost....Oh me, the sweet Grange!--Thwaite, I mean (bedpost again); to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> mass <b>of</b> weeds and ruin! ...|$|R
60|$|After {{revolving}} {{these questions}} {{in my mind}} for some time, another one rudely thrust itself upon me: would she come at all? It was already seven minutes past nine; {{she had never been}} so late. Now that I came to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> would be the most natural result of the wasp business. The thought shocked me. I ceased to walk up and down my study, and stopped whistling. I think my face must have flushed; I know my pulse beat faster. My eyes fell upon the body of him who I believed had been my friend. I felt like crushing his remains with my fist. He had been my enemy! He had shown me what I had to lose, and he had made me lose it.|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} {{and walked back to}} the camp in the moonlight, {{thinking}} hard. He was angry with Charnock, but vaguely sorry. Bob had some virtues and was throwing himself away, although, when one came to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> was only true to some extent. What one meant was that he was throwing away his opportunities of rising to a higher plane; while Bob was satisfied with his present level Sadie was good enough for him, perhaps too good. Life together might be hard for both, and there was a touch of pathos in his burning all the tender tokens that bound him to the past, though it was ominous that he kept the whisky. He could, however, get as much liquor as he wanted at the hotel; that is, if Sadie allowed it, but there was some comfort in the thought that the girl was clever and firm.|$|E
6000|$|These {{laws and}} customs sound, I know, like {{a record of}} some nasty-minded lunatic's inventions. They were invincible facts in that {{vanished}} world into which, by some accident, I had been born, {{and it was the}} dream of any better state of things that was scouted as lunacy. Just <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> <b>This</b> girl I loved with all my soul, for whom I was ready to sacrifice my life, was not good enough to marry young Verrall. And I had only to look at his even, handsome, characterless face to perceive a creature weaker and no better than myself. She was to be his pleasure until he chose to cast her aside, and the poison of our social system had so saturated her nature--his evening dress, his freedom and his money had seemed so fine to her and I so clothed in squalor--that to that prospect she had consented. And to resent the social conventions that created their situation, was called [...] "class envy," [...] and gently born preachers reproached us for the mildest resentment against an injustice no living man would now either endure or consent to profit by.|$|E
60|$|Latterly I had {{observed}} that Toby’s melancholy had greatly increased, and I had frequently {{seen him since}} our arrival at the island gazing wistfully upon the shore, when {{the remainder of the}} crew would be rioting below. I was aware that he entertained a cordial detestation of the ship, and believed that should a fair chance of escape present itself, he would embrace it willingly. But the attempt was so perilous in the place where we then lay, that I supposed myself the only individual on board the ship who was sufficiently reckless to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In <b>this,</b> however, I was mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{friends did}} not behave well to you," [...] {{he said in}} a hollow voice to Trenchard. [...] "They ought to have made you Secretary <b>of</b> the Treasury. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>It</b> is an {{important}} post, and may lead to anything; and, so far as I am concerned, it would give me real pleasure to see it." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{chief of}} the Bureau of Personnel, Holloway {{summarized}} his philosophy {{to a group of}} young naval officers: [...] "You men probably do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in <b>this</b> way, but I do. To be commissioned in the Navy, you had to be appointed by the President with the approval of Congress. This is the procedure and requirement for the seating of a Supreme Court judge or an ambassador. This is why a naval officer must have his chin out at all times." [...] Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a lieutenant commander in BuPers from 1953–1955, remembered Holloway as [...] "the superior who most impressed me when I was a young officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, my Holly--forgive {{me for my}} weakness," [...] she said. [...] "Thou seest {{after all}} I am a very woman. Think--now <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> <b>This</b> morning didst thou speak of the place of torment {{appointed}} by this new religion of thine. Hell or Hades thou didst call it--a place where the vital essence lives and retains an individual memory, and where all the errors and faults of judgment, and unsatisfied passions and the unsubstantial terrors of the mind wherewith it hath at any time had to do, come to mock and haunt and gibe and wring the heart for ever and for ever with the vision of its own hopelessness. Thus, even thus, have I lived for full two thousand years--for some six and sixty generations, as ye reckon time--in a Hell, as thou callest it--tormented {{by the memory of}} a crime, tortured day and night with an unfulfilled desire--without companionship, without comfort, without death, and led on only down my dreary road by the marsh lights of Hope, which, though they flickered here and there, and now glowed strong, and now were not, yet, as my skill told me, would one day lead unto my deliverer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a ha'porth. We couldn't {{get so much}} as soap for house-washing, unless Mrs. Blake {{had stood}} by us and let us have her soap. Ada and I have to do every bit of washing about the place. I do think well of Peter because he insists on washing his own shirts and stockings. Unfortunately we haven't got a mangle, {{and we have to}} iron the sheets if we want them to look at all nice. Ada's sheets and mine, and Florian's, are only just rough pressed. Of course we get tea and those things down from Dublin. Only think {{of the way in which}} the tradespeople are ruining themselves. Everything has to go to Dublin to be sold: {{potatoes}} and cattle, and now butter. Papa says that they won't pay for the carriage. When you come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> boycotting is the most ruinous invention on both sides. When poor Florian declared that he would go to mass after he had first told the story about Pat Carroll, they swore they would boycott the chapel if he entered the door. Not a single person would stay to receive the mass. So he wouldn't go. It was not long after that when he became afraid to show his face outside the hall-door." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{prayer of}} the Bee notwithstanding, Philip Hadden slept ill that night. He {{felt in the}} best of health, and his {{conscience}} was not troubling him more than usual, but rest he could not. Whenever he closed his eyes, his mind conjured up a picture of the grim witch-doctoress, so strangely named the Bee, and the sound of her evil-omened words as he had heard them that afternoon. He was neither a superstitious nor a timid man, and any supernatural beliefs that might linger in his mind were, to say the least of it, dormant. But do what he might, he could not shake off a certain eerie sensation of fear, lest there should be some grains of truth in the prophesyings of this hag. What if it were a fact that he was near his death, and that the heart which beat so strongly in his breast must soon be still for ever--no, he would not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> gloomy place, and the dreadful sight which he saw that day, had upset his nerves. The domestic customs of these Zulus were not pleasant, and for his part he was determined to be clear of them so soon as he was able to escape the country.|$|E
6000|$|She looked away. [...] "Come {{and see me}} to-morrow, I must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>It</b> {{is so hard to}} decide--our {{lives are}} so different----" [...] She arose abruptly. [...] "I must go now. Come into the concert, I'm going to sing." [...] She glanced at him in a sad, half-smiling way. [...] "I can't sing If I Were a Voice for you, but perhaps you'll like my aria better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... § 28. Then, as {{touching}} {{the kind of}} work done by these two men, the more I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> I find <b>this</b> conclusion more impressed upon me,--that the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something, and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophecy, and religion,--all in one.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--If {{you should}} not like the first 2 chapters, send them to me and begin with Chapter 3--or Part 3, I believe you call these things in the magazine. I have {{finished}} No. 4., which closes the series, and will mail it tomorrow if I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I like <b>this</b> one, I liked the preceding one (already mailed to you some time ago) but I had my doubts about 1 and 2. Do not hesitate to squelch them, even with derision and insult.|$|R
60|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{given in the}} chronicles of the times, the negotiations were opened in the following manner: One day the Portuguese ambassador at London came to a certain high officer of the king's household, and introduced {{the subject of his}} majesty's marriage, saying, {{in the course of the}} conversation, that he thought the Princess Catharine of Portugal would be a very eligible match, and adding moreover, that he was authorized to say that, with the lady, very advantageous terms could be offered. Charles said he would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> gave the ambassador sufficient encouragement to induce him to take another step. He obtained an audience of Charles the next day, and proposed the subject directly for his consideration. The ambassador knew very well that the question would turn, in Charles's mind, on the pecuniary and political advantages of the match; so he stated at once what they would be. He was authorized to offer, he said, the sum of five hundred thousand pounds [Footnote: Equal to two or three millions of dollars.] as the princess's portion, and to surrender to the English crown various foreign possessions, which had, till then, belonged to the Portuguese. One of the principal of these was the island of Bombay in the East Indies. Another was Tangier, a port in Africa. The English did not, at that time, hold any East Indian territories. He likewise offered to convey to the English nation the right of trading with the great South American country of Brazil, which then pertained to the Portuguese crown.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the more}} shame {{to me to}} have done {{some of the things}} I have! The {{reconciliation}} of the two women in Ginistrella, for instance, which could never really have taken place. That sort of thing is ignoble; I blush when I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> <b>This</b> new affair must be a golden vessel, filled with the purest distillation of the actual; and oh, how it bothers me, the shaping of the vase--the hammering of the metal! I have to hammer it so fine, so smooth; I don't do more than an inch or two a day. And all the while I have to be so careful not to let a drop of the liquor escape! When I see {{the kind of things that}} Life does, I despair of ever catching her peculiar trick. She has an impudence, life! If one risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks! It takes ever so long to believe it. You don't know yet, my dear fellow. It is n't till one has been watching life for forty years that one finds out half of what she's up to! Therefore one's earlier things must inevitably contain a mass of rot. And with what one sees, on one side, with its tongue in its cheek, defying one to be real enough, and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at one's cynicism, the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the artist himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else. Of course one mustn't bother about the bonnes gens." [...] Mark Ambient went on, while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife, as interpreted by his remarkable sister.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{somewhat}} recovered I {{began to}} examine the spot in which I found myself, and truly {{it seemed to me}} that I had reached a garden of delights. There were trees everywhere, and they were laden with flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and out under their shadow. When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook, though the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me sometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished heartily that I had stayed at home at ease. However, the morning sunlight restored my courage, and I once more wandered among the trees, but always with some anxiety as to what I might see next. I had penetrated some distance into the island when I saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at first I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself. Going up to him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his head at me in reply. I then asked what he did there, and he made signs to me that he wished to get across the river to gather some fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back. Pitying his age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the stream I bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him get down. But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet (even now it makes me laugh to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!),</b> <b>this</b> creature who had seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the ground. When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other, until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits. This went on all day, and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness, the terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with rage and bitterness in my heart.|$|E
60|$|And {{fade away}} it did at last, and neither the cold rain nor the howling wind {{had given him}} such a chill as crept through all his body, when memory and {{realization}} drove forth this sweet flower of his imagination. All the cruel hopelessness, the horror of his position, rushed in upon him like a foul nightmare. He saw himself shunned and despised, the faces of all men averted from him; all that had gone to make his life worthy, and even famous, forgotten in the stigma of an awful crime. He saw her eager, beautiful face, white and convulsed with horror, shrinking away from him as from some loathsome object. God! it was madness to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> Let <b>this</b> thought go from him, fade away from his reeling brain, or he would surely go mad.|$|R
60|$|Now if {{you mean}} it, old man--if you are in earnest--proceed, in God's name, and be by me forever blest. I cannot {{conceive}} of a rational man deliberately piling such an atrocious job upon himself; {{but if there is}} such a man and you be that man, why then pile it on. It will cost me a pang every time I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>this</b> anguish will be eingebusst to me in the joy and comfort I shall get out of the not having to read the verfluchtete proofs myself. But if you have repented of your augenblichlicher Tobsucht and got back to calm cold reason again, I won't hold you to it unless I find I have got you down in writing somewhere.

Gee! it makes me sweat to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> But about <b>this</b> bank robbin' business. You can't exactly say that I robbed a bank.
