5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> determines if an autopsy is required.

If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> that the court lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an elective office was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{continued}} practising law. In 1951, {{he gained}} national attention by accepting the Atherton case, {{in which a}} young telegraph operator {{had been accused of}} negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Justice Scalia chastises the Court {{for taking}} equity {{jurisdiction}} of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> draws an analogy with Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing {{judgment on the}} decision of a military court-martial before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the military commissions in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should {{not be subject to}} judicial oversight.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not always been <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E

5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E

Upon returning to FBI headquarters, Mulder heads out on vacation to visit Graceland, leaving Scully to follow up on the Pudovkin case for him. Scully is uninterested in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> expresses serious doubts about Pudovkin's credibility, leading to an argument with an inconsiderate Mulder. Scully becomes upset over the direction her life and career are going.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E

In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that this was not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) was a San Francisco Police Department's investigator, but {{the death}} of his wife, Trudy, led him to develop depression, obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and multiple phobias. Now, as a private detective, Monk investigates the murder of Nicole Vasquez (Michelle Addison). Later, a shooting occurs during a campaign rally, resulting in the bodyguard of mayoral candidate Warren St. Claire (Michael Hogan) getting killed. The incumbent mayor orders Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to bring Monk in on <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and,</b> as Monk's former supervisor, reluctantly, he does.|$|E

The jury rejected Intertainment's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute, which would have tripled the damages if Franchise had been convicted on that charge. The judgment forced Franchise into bankruptcy a few months later. The failure of the film was also reported to have led in 2002 to Travolta firing his manager Jonathan Krane, who had set up the deal with Franchise in the first place.|$|E
