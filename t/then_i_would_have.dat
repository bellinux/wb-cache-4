I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said so. I did not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|When George Lucas first {{approached}} Steven Spielberg for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg recalled, [...] "George said if I {{directed the}} first one <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to direct a trilogy. He had three stories in mind. It turned out George did not have three stories in mind {{and we had to}} make up subsequent stories." [...] Spielberg and Lucas attributed the film's tone, which was darker than Raiders of the Lost Ark, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships (George with his wife, and Spielberg with his girlfriend). In addition, Lucas felt [...] "it had to have been a dark film. The way Empire Strikes Back was the dark second act of the Star Wars trilogy." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1934, the {{governor}} general {{informed him that}} the King had offered him a knighthood, [...] "for services to cricket", The citation made a veiled reference to Woodfull's actions during the bodyline episode. Woodfull always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field, and declined the honour. In later life he said [...] "Had I been awarded it for being an educationalist, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> accepted it. But under no circumstances would I accept it for playing cricket. In 1963, he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to education. In 1965, while on holiday {{with his wife and}} daughter Jill, he collapsed and died while playing golf in Tweed Heads, New South Wales. His family remained adamant that the bruising bodyline attack had permanently damaged his health and curtailed his life. Woodfull was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001, one of the first 15 inductees.|$|E

2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said 2100, or 2070 maybe. But now I think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped {{out of his chair}} and ran out of the room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm just glad he didn't get up and leave because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} broadcast on the BBC 4 radio programme The Human Button, Callaghan {{became the only}} Prime Minister to go on record with his opinion on ordering a retaliation {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack on the United Kingdom:If it were to become necessary or vital, it would have meant the deterrent had failed, because the value of the nuclear weapon is frankly only as a deterrent," [...] he said. [...] "But if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt, necessary to do it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it. I've had terrible doubts, of course, about this. I say to you, if I had lived after having pressed that button, I could never, ever have forgiven myself.|$|E

2500|$|All {{relevant}} {{former prime}} ministers have supported an [...] "independent nuclear deterrent", including David Cameron and the incumbent Prime Minister Theresa May. Only one former Prime Minister, Lord Callaghan, has given any insight on his orders: Callaghan stated that, although {{in a situation}} where nuclear weapon use was required – and thus the whole purpose and value of the weapon as a deterrent had failed – he would have ordered use of nuclear weapons, if needed: ...if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt it was necessary to do it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done it (used the weapon)...but if I had lived after pressing that button, I could have never forgiven myself. Lord Healey, Secretary of State for Defence and [...] "alternate decision-taker" [...] under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, said that in the event of Soviet nuclear weapons attacking the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister had been killed or incapacitated, he would not have ordered a retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|Axelrod {{contemplated}} {{taking a}} break from politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, as five of the candidates—Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Chris Dodd and Tom Vilsack—were past clients. Personal ties between Axelrod and Hillary Clinton made it difficult, as she had raised significant funds for epilepsy on behalf of a foundation co-founded by Axelrod's wife and mother, Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE). (Axelrod's daughter suffers from developmental disabilities associated with chronic epileptic seizures.) Axelrod's wife even said that a 1999 conference Clinton convened to find a cure for the condition was [...] "one {{of the most important things}} anyone has done for epilepsy." [...] Axelrod ultimately decided to participate in the Obama campaign, and served as chief strategist and media advisor for Obama. He told The Washington Post, [...] "I thought that if I could help Barack Obama get to Washington, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> accomplished something great in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 1998, O'Neal {{relocated}} to New York City to further his career, working regular spots at the Comedy Cellar. In early 1998, he {{took part in}} the fourth annual US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado. He then moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of finding greater fame: [...] "I tap danced like you wouldn't believe ... trying to get something ... If I'd have had a gun back <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> shot myself". Soon after, O'Neal travelled to England after he was [...] "essentially thrown out of America" [...] as he could not earn enough money, and was unwilling to yield to the demands of club owners that he change his confrontational act. O'Neal worked hard to gain the respect of his peers and recalled it took around five months [...] "for them to go 'Ok, this guy's not playing around". It was also during this time that O'Neal caught the eye of English comedian Ricky Gervais, still early in his own stand-up career, who cites O'Neal as a favourite of his. O'Neal ranked his time in England, and gaining respect as a comic there, as one of his most proud moments of his career.|$|E

5000|$|Bobick {{suffers from}} chronic {{traumatic}} encephalopathy. Originally diagnosed in 1997 after his arm injury, his progressive decline has been noteworthy in recent years.

2500|$|On November 3, 2006, Martínez {{stated that}} if he could not return to full strength, he might end up {{retiring}} after the 2007 season. [...] "It's getting better, and progress is above all what is hoped for", Martínez told the Associated Press. [...] "To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn't want that, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to think about giving it all up." [...] Martínez added, [...] "It's going to be a bitter winter because I am {{going to have to do}} a lot of work. The pain I feel was one of the worst I have felt with any injury in my career." [...] But by December 30, 2006, Martínez was more optimistic: [...] "The progress has been excellent. I don't have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course." [...] Martínez also reported bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: [...] "I've put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that's one of our strategies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mercy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created by}} a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 for the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. The characters were created in August 2009 and open auditions were held for the cast at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which she commented: [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If I was meant to go into the main show, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, I just thought that it's the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they {{have a long way to}} go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have.</b> But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

5000|$|She {{wrote about}} her {{experience}} of the chador as a western woman in Iran."I wonder how the media might have treated Ann Widdecombe or Blair's so called 'babes' if all women MPs here wore the uniform of the chador. Perhaps then the women in Parliament would be taken more seriously as professional politicians doing a job, not as fat or thin women in grey or pink suits.

He put the thought in my head because until <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> thought of saying that I wanted to do that; it didn’t seem to be one of the jobs in the world that could be open to me.” At this time, Heckerling also joined the Museum of Modern Art, where she attended screenings of old movies on weekends.|$|R

500|$|According to Henderson, {{since the}} {{intelligent}} design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster.
