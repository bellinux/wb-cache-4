5|$|Immediately {{following}} the typhoon's <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact,</b> the Japanese military was deployed to Osaka before nightfall on September21 and water was being trucked in. Officials in Osaka Prefecture released an immediate ¥10million in relief funds. Baron Kischizaemon Sumitomo donated ¥1million (US$300,000) to relief funds, the largest such private donation in the nation's {{history at the}} time. The Cabinet of Japan held a special meeting to discuss emergency operations. Three destroyers from the Kure Naval District, loaded with medical equipment and other essentials, were deployed to assist in relief work. Outbreaks of typhoid fever, dysentery, and scarlet fever plagued survivors in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the air campaign in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact,</b> with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex {{analysis}} and topology. He also had a disagreement with Émile Borel about whose integral was more general. However, these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis; his contributions to this field had a <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> on the shape of the field today and his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis. These have important practical implications for fundamental physics of which Lebesgue would have been completely unaware, as noted below.|$|E

This is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have <b>tremendous</b> <b>impacts</b> on borrowing costs. The difference between BB debt and AAA debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points. For example, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor Credit's rating in January 2002, but senior automobile backed securities, issued by Ford Motor Credit in January 2002 and April 2002, continue to be rated AAA because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other credit enhancements.|$|R
25|$|Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that {{terminate}} in the sea, {{including most}} glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which {{often results in}} a <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{movement}} was active exclusively within Lutheranism, it had a <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> on Protestantism worldwide, particularly in North America and Europe.

Although Spener did not directly advocate the quietistic, legalistic and semi-separatist practices of Pietism, they were more or less involved in the positions he assumed or the practices which he encouraged.|$|E

Each successive exhibition denoted a significant phase in the development of modern art: Beginning with retrospectives of Gauguin, Cézanne and others; the influence such would have on the art that would follow; the Fauves (André Derain, Henri Matisse); followed by the proto-Cubists (Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay); the Cubists, the Orphists, and Futurists.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{were on the}} {{offensive}} {{for most of the}} war and used massed infantry assaults against defensive positions, which would later become the standard of all European armies during World War I. The battles of the Russo–Japanese War, in which machine guns and artillery took a heavy toll on Russian and Japanese troops, were a precursor to the trench warfare of World War I. A German military advisor sent to Japan, Jakob Meckel, had a <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> {{on the development of the}} Japanese military training, tactics, strategy, and organization. His reforms were credited with Japan's overwhelming victory over China in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895. However, his over-reliance on infantry in offensive campaigns also led to a large number of Japanese casualties.|$|E
25|$|This era of {{colonialism}} ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. Due to the <b>tremendous</b> <b>impact</b> this caused on the city's inhabitants {{and on the}} country as a whole, the changes that resulted {{at the end of the}} colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a significant result of the colonial era. These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is clearly visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.|$|E
