500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like two or <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> I have to say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Churchill later {{made the}} {{following}} statement in House of Commons on 26 March 1913: [...] "Altogether, compared with other navies, the British aeroplane service has started very well... I have a less satisfactory account to give of airships. Naval airship developments were retarded by various causes. The mishap which destroyed the May-fly, or the Won't Fly, {{as it would be}} more accurate to call it, at Barrow, was a very serious set-back to the development of Admiralty policy in airships." [...] And on 31 March 1913 Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell (who would himself later become First Lord of the Admiralty) made the following comment regarding the fate of Mayfly and the lack of British airships: [...] "The 'May-fly' broke <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> nothing further has been done. In non-rigid airships, Germany has seventeen, and against that we have two very inferior ones and two on order, but we are not doing anything in this respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|On both 23 May and 30 May after Friday prayers, tens of {{thousands}} of demonstrators rallied in various cities including Tripoli and Benghazi in support of Gen. Haftar and his campaign against Islamist militias and also in support of Haftar's calls to suspend parliament. In Benghazi, thousands of pro-Haftar demonstrators gathered outside Tibesti Hotel and in the city's Tahreer Square, as well as others in the city of Bayda further east. [...] "No to militias, Libya will not become another Afghanistan" [...] and [...] "Yes to the army, yes to the police", their banners read. Meanwhile, crowds in Tripoli's Martyr's Square chanted against the parliament and in support of a national army and police force to replace the militias that run rampant in the country. They sang the national anthem as they waved the flag and carried banners that read [...] "Yes to Dignity". They called for an official response to the militias. [...] "Libya is in trouble, we want police, we want army", they chanted. While some Libyans don't back Haftar and don't want military rule, they support what he is doing. The protest, dubbed the [...] "Friday of Dignity", took its name from the offensive launched by Haftar, one week ago in the eastern city of Benghazi. The demonstrations were some of the largest the country has seen since the uprising <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> were the first since then to be held simultaneously in cities across Libya, which put more pressure on the embattled Islamist-led parliament to offer concessions. The interim government issued a statement in support of Friday’s protests and reasserted its proposal this week to suspend parliament. [...] "The participation of tens {{of thousands}} [...] requires all to answer {{to the demands of the}} people who represent legitimacy that can't be ignored", the statement said.|$|E

60|$|One evening {{soon after}} his arrival, Grahame stood in the patio of the Hotel International. The International had been built by some long-forgotten Spanish hidalgo, and still bore traces of ancient art.

5000|$|The Shadow of Yesterday {{takes place}} on the world of Near, a post-apocalyptic fantasy world where civilization has been {{destroyed}} <b>three</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> is undergoing a rebirth.
