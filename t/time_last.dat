25|$|Coleman {{took nearly}} a year off after having to get ACL surgery and {{returned}} at UFC 17. Coleman was originally scheduled to face Randy Couture in a title match for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but Couture was injured during training {{and was forced to}} pull out of the fight. Coleman instead faced a relatively unknown (at that <b>time)</b> <b>last</b> minute replacement fighter, up and coming Lion's Den product Pete Williams. In what turned out to be another long and strenuous battle, Coleman appeared to be completely exhausted after 10 minutes; he was fatigued to the point of resting his hands on his knees during the fight. Williams took advantage of Coleman's fatigue and landed a heavy kick to the face, knocking 'The Hammer' out for the first time in his career.|$|E

500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively.

[...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate our good <b>time</b> <b>last</b> year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion.

Jamaica bananas are sold from the ship for from $1.40 to $1.50 per bunch for number ones, and for eighty cents per bunch for number twos, and third class bananas bring from forty to fifty cents.

2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players spent a lot of <b>time</b> <b>last</b> week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E
