500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>About</b> it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that my list of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely {{as simple as it}} seems: This is a recent hit song whose title is dominated by the words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Garner was {{replaced}} {{in his role}} by Paul Bremer on May 11, 2003, {{there was quite a}} bit of speculation as to why he {{was replaced}} so abruptly.

He wanted early elections—90 days after the fall of Baghdad—and the new government to decide how to run the country and what to do with its assets. Garner said [...] "I don't think Iraqis need to go by the U.S. plan, I think that {{what we need to do}} is set an Iraqi government that represents the freely elected will of the people.

5000|$|Throughout Nixon's {{presidency}} {{he referred}} to the Wilson desk hundreds of times in official speeches, such as the [...] "Silent majority" [...] speech, and in talks with high ranking visitors. During official White House tours, guides wrongly told of how Woodrow Wilson used the desk. This misconception was first discovered to be untrue by an assistant curator at the White House. This assistant curator came to yet another incorrect conclusion about who had previously used the desk. This curator wrongly stated that the desk was not used by Woodrow Wilson, but instead by Vice President Henry Wilson, under President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. The assistant curator enlightened Cecilia Bellinger, a chief researcher in the writing operation at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>about</b> the mistake who in turn told William Safire, one of Nixon's speech writers. It fell to Safire to inform Nixon about the mistake in the provenance of the Wilson Desk.|$|E
