25|$|There were other, minor traditions {{concerning}} Cain and Abel, of both {{older and}} newer date.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{found in}} Newton County are {{possibly}} {{native to the}} Midwestern states of Indiana, Wisconsin or Illinois.

As of January 2014, neither has been buried, as the investigation is still being conducted. Their dental records and DNA are being stored in national databases.|$|E
25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What critic would be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There {{seemed to be no}} precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|E

25|$|Manouchian wrote poetry and, with an Armenian {{friend who}} used the {{pseudonym}} of Séma (Kégham Atmadjian), founded two communist-leaning literary magazines, Tchank ("Effort") and Mechagouyt ("Culture"). They published articles on French literature and Armenian culture. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> translated the poetry of Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Rimbaud into Armenian, making many of these works available in Armenian for the first time. Both Manouchian and Séma enrolled at the Sorbonne to audit courses in literature, philosophy, economics, and history.|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Vibbards 26-year {{career on}} the Hudson was to remain remarkably free of accidents. The steamer was {{involved}} in a tragedy in 1876 however, when on August 30, while entering the slip at the foot of 24th Street, North River, about 6 pm, she collided with a small boat which crossed her bows. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in the boat were thrown into the water, and one of them, an 18-year-old named William Koster, went missing and was presumed drowned.|$|E
25|$|A {{change of}} metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or {{entrance}} of a character, and thus frames a scene. At {{other times it}} indicates a change of pace, such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle. In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the Heauton Timorumenos, Eunuchus, and Phormio, one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics. Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene.|$|E

25|$|When Pratt met Rogers at McClintocksville on a {{business}} trip, he already knew Charles Ellis, having earlier bought whale oil from him back east in Fairhaven. Although Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> agreed to sell the entire output of their small Wamsutta refinery to Pratt's company at a fixed price. This worked well at first. Then, a few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators.

25|$|Ludwig's {{childhood}} years {{did have}} happy moments. He lived {{for much of}} the time at Castle Hohenschwangau, a fantasy castle his father had built near the Alpsee (Alp Lake) near Füssen. It was decorated in the Gothic Revival style with many frescoes depicting heroic German sagas. The family also visited Lake Starnberg. As an adolescent, Ludwig became close friends with his aide de camp, Prince Paul, a member of Bavaria's wealthy Thurn und Taxis family. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> rode together, read poetry aloud, and staged scenes from the Romantic operas of Richard Wagner. The friendship ended when Paul became engaged in 1866. During his youth Ludwig also initiated a lifelong friendship with his cousin, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, later Empress of Austria.|$|E
25|$|His most {{important}} teacher was Jean Dorat. He was able {{not only to}} impart knowledge, but also to kindle enthusiasm in Scaliger. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed his home for the next thirty years of his life, for in 1563 the professor recommended him to Louis de Chasteigner, the young lord of La Roche-Posay, as a companion in his travels. A close friendship sprang up between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> which remained unbroken till the death of Louis in 1595. The travellers first went to Rome. Here they found Marc Antoine Muret, who, when at Bordeaux and Toulouse, had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar Scaliger at Agen. Muret soon recognized the young Scaliger's merits, and introduced him to many contacts well worth knowing.|$|E

25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said {{that the two men}} were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|In their youth, Ihsahn and Samoth {{met at a}} {{rock music}} seminar. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> began playing {{together}} under various names; first Dark Device, then Xerasia, then Embryonic. The group soon evolved into the now well-known band Thou Shalt Suffer. Soon, however, Samoth began to write music outside of Thou Shalt Suffer, and together with Ihsahn and a new bass player called Mortiis (later of his own eponymous band Mortiis), Emperor was formed. After a short while together, the band released a demo entitled Wrath of the Tyrant. It quickly gained popularity in the underground and {{attracted the attention of}} the then-start-up label Candlelight. Soon afterwards, a record contract was signed, Samoth moved to rhythm guitar, Ihsahn continued the vocal duties and lead guitars, and Faust was recruited as a drummer. The band was signed to the infamous first black metal label, Deathlike Silence Productions, and planned to release their next album soon, though the band never managed to release any material while signed to DSP.|$|E

500|$|McClelland was {{assigned}} successively to the Army service schools at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His electronics-minded brother Herbert [...] "Mac" [...] McClelland was attending nearby Kansas State and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{built the first}} radio transmitter at the college in 1918, stringing an antenna from the Physics building to a water tower.

500|$|In 1857 in Paris, he {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of fellow Dane Harald Scharff, a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with Copenhagen's Royal Theatre. Andersen was returning to Copenhagen via Paris following a visit to Charles Dickens in England, and Scharff was on holiday with his Copenhagen housemate, the actor Lauritz Eckardt. Andersen and Scharff toured Notre Dame together. [...] Three years passed before Andersen again met the pair quite by accident in Bavaria in July 1860; the three men enjoyed a week together in Munich and its environs. It is probable that Andersen {{fell in love with}} Scharff at this time.

500|$|Though Wilde {{deployed}} {{characters that}} were by now familiar—the dandy lord, the overbearing matriarch, {{the woman with}} a past, the puritan young lady—his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies. Lady Bracknell, for instance, embodies respectable, upper-class society, but Eltis notes how her development [...] "from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character" [...] can be traced through Wilde's revisions of the play. For <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> Wilde presents not stereotypical stage [...] "dudes" [...] but intelligent beings who, as Jackson puts it, [...] "speak like their creator in well-formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue-words". Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail, their old-fashioned enthusiasms, and the Canon's fastidious pedantry, pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text.|$|E
