30|$|Finally, {{we propose}} {{and discuss the}} merits of two {{enhanced}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedures</b> based on the fast adjustment algorithm. The fast <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> with bipolar probing signals achieves the isolation gain of the (much slower) gradient search algorithm {{at the expense of}} a mean penalty of 0.48 dB. We observe that the fast adjustment aided gradient algorithm requires 72 % less steps than the gradient search algorithm in our measurements.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a technique, called the safety stock <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> (SSAP), which enables the {{determination}} of safety stocks that ensure target service levels in simulation studies of inventory systems. The technique is based on a netting procedure constructed so that the net requirement process and the replenishment process are independent of the safety stock and that the inventory process satisfies an invariance relation. The procedure is presented for three kinds of service measures; namely the cycle service level, the fill rate and the ready rate. In a numerical example the benefits of using the safety stock <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> are shown. In this example three wellknown lot size models are compared assuming stochastic and time-varying demand. Moreover, we propose the safety stock <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> to be used in practical situations to set safety stock levels in companies for instance when demand is nonstationary.

If one views the above assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited by lack of access to source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly that the GISS software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious steps of up to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error {{in the course of their}} programming. According to any reasonable audit standards, one would conclude that the GISS software had failed this particular test. While GISS can (and has) patched the particular error that I reported to them, their patching hardly proves the merit of the GISS (and USHCN) <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedures.</b> These need to be carefully examined.|$|R

40|$|High {{bandwidth}} {{environment is}} useful for sending large volumes of data within short period of time. As {{there is a growing}} demand for high bandwidth networks, data transfer must take place without any congestion. Hence {{attempts have been made to}} find a suitable window <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> for congestion avoidance. In TCP, since window size is usually increased by 1 MSS/RTT and halved upon packet losses in any network, it is not suitable for high speed network. In this paper a study is made on window <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> for high bandwidth networks using XCP protocol. The window <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> is based on the queue and admitted rate. This proposed idea will be useful for high bandwidth environment for congestion avoidance.

40|$|Voltage {{balancing}} {{among the}} series connected wind turbines {{is one of}} the main technical challenges of offshore wind farms with DC series-parallel collection systems. Due to wake effect considerations, the power generated among the series connected wind turbines does not remain the same and the series connection causes the output voltages of the turbines to be distributed in proportion to their power output. Power curtailment is required in order to prevent the turbines being subjected to over-voltage and under-voltage conditions. In this paper, a voltage <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed to eliminate over-voltage and under-voltage of wind turbines. Based on the voltage <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> and the power generation model of wind turbines, the energy curtailment of a wind farm is analyzed with the consideration of wake effect due to series connection. A case study on several DC series-parallel collection configurations is presented to analyze the energy curtailment of wind farms using the voltage <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

Though it {{had been}} {{employed}} for limit analysis and integral safety assessment of pressure pipe and vessel, most of the elastic modulus <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedures</b> were applicable to simple structures because their load multiplier was mainly determined by stress. In this paper, a series of element bearing ratio (EBR) based load multiplier algorithms are given, in which the influence of both stress and material on limit load are included. The EBR based load multiplier algorithms are investigated, and two efficient algorithms are suggested. Then the two algorithms combined with the elastic modulus <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> of elastic modulus reduction method are applied to limit analysis and integral safety assessment of penstocks...|$|R

40|$|In {{construction}} of estimators from survey data, one often encounters important issues arising from nonresponse. For establishment surveys, methods {{to address these}} issues generally must account for important features of the sample design and weighting structure. For any given nonresponse <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure,</b> an analyst makes implicit or explicit use of models for the nonresponse phenomenon and the outcome variables of primary interest. The performance of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> then depends {{on the extent to which}} the data deviate from the assumed models, the impact of these deviations on estimator bias, and the inferential power of diagnostics designed to detect these deviations.

40|$|The paper aims at {{analyzing}} the seasonal movements of consumer prices and wholesale prices {{with respect to}} different seasonal adjustment techniques. Suitability of different seasonal adjustment techniques will be tested for CPI, WPI, CPI excluding food prices, and WPI excluding agricultural prices. The literature on the analysis of seasonality is composed of different groups. One group treats the seasonality as a noise that contaminates the economic data. Another group treats seasonality as a more integrated part of the modeling strategy. However, the most well-known method among the seasonal <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> is the treatment {{to the problem of}} seasonality as a noise, and this is the method that has been widely applied by the statistical offices of different countries to create official seasonally adjusted data.

40|$|Economic {{evaluations}} {{have become}} an important and much used tool in aiding decision makers in deciding on reimbursement or implementation of new healthcare technologies. Nevertheless, the impact of economic evaluations on reimbursement decisions has been modest; results of economic evaluations {{do not have a}} good record in predicting funding decisions. This is usually explained in terms of fairness; there is increasing awareness that valuations of QALYs may differ when the QALYs accrue to different patients. The problem, however, is that these equity concerns often remain implicit, and therefore frustrate explicitness and transparency in evidence-based decision making. It has been suggested that a so-called equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> may (partially) solve this problem. Typically this would involve the application of so-called equity weights, which can be used to recalculate the value of QALY gains for different patients. This paper explores such an equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure,</b> using the equity concept of proportional shortfall. Proportional shortfall assumes that measurement of inequalities in health should concentrate on the fraction of QALYs that people lose relative to their remaining life expectancy, and not on the absolute number of QALYs lost or gained. It is the ratio of QALYs lost over the QALYs remaining. This equity concept combines elements of two popular but conflicting notions of equity: fair innings and severity-of-illness. We applied the concept of proportional shortfall to ten conditions and tentatively explored how an equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> using proportional shortfall might affect priority setting. Our equity <b>adjustment</b> <b>procedure</b> lowered In conclusion, our results suggest that equity can be measured and that integration of equity concerns into an economic evaluation improves the fit between economic models and reimbursement decisions. It is recommended that cost-effectiveness driven health policy systems consider equity adjustments. Cost-effectiveness, Cost-utility, Health-policy, Reimbursement...|$|R
