We use a unique, proprietary dataset that has the investments of banks at the security level for 2005 - 2012 in conjunction with the credit register from Germany. Analyzing data at the security level for each bank in each period, we find that during the crisis, banks with higher trading expertise increase their overall investments in securities, especially in those that had a larger price drop. The quantitative effects are largest for trading-expertise banks with higher capital and in securities with lower rating and long-term maturity. In fact, there are no differential effects for <b>triple-A</b> <b>rated</b> securities. Moreover, banks with higher trading expertise reduce their overall supply of credit in crisis times - i. e., for the same borrower at the same time, trading-expertise banks reduce lending relative to other banks. This effect is more pronounced for trading-expertise banks with higher capital, and the credit reduction is binding at the firm level. Finally, these differential effects for trading-expertise banks are not present outside the crisis period...|$|R

40|$|In the centres {{of stars}} where the {{temperature}} is high enough, three alpha-particles (helium nuclei) are able to combine to form C- 12 because of a resonant reaction leading to a nuclear excited state(1). (Stars with masses greater than similar to 0. 5 {{times that of the}} Sun will {{at some point in their}} lives have a central temperature high enough for this reaction to proceed.) Although the reaction rate is of critical significance for determining elemental abundances in the Universe(1), and for determining the size of the iron core of a star just before it goes supernova(2), it has hitherto been insufficiently determined(2). Here we report a measurement of the inverse process, where a C- 12 nucleus decays to three alpha-particles. We find a dominant resonance at an energy of similar to 11 MeV, but do not confirm the presence of a resonance at 9. 1 MeV (ref. 3). We show that interference between two resonances has important effects on our measured spectrum. Using these data, we calculate the <b>triple-a</b> <b>rate</b> for temperatures from 10 (7) K to 10 (10) K and find significant deviations from the standard rates(3). Our rate below similar to 5 x 10 (7) K is higher than the previous standard, implying that the critical amounts of carbon that catalysed hydrogen burning in the first stars are produced twice as fast as previously believed(4).

50|$|Nonetheless, {{some have}} criticized the entire {{business}} model. In her book Confidence Game, Christine S. Richard examines the basic assumptions upon which the industry was based. She argues that a monoline's business can be seen as, basically, selling a <b>triple-A</b> credit <b>rating</b> to a municipal bond issuer. However, the credit rating agencies had a separate “rating scale” applied to obligations of municipal issuers, as opposed to non-municipal issuers (e.g., corporations). Some argued that if the rating agencies had rated municipalities on the same scale they rated corporations, then the municipalities would have been rated much higher to begin with, and thus {{there was no real}} need for bond insurance. The question was debated before Congress in 2008, at the House Committee on Financial Services under Barney Frank. Richard Blumenthal, then-attorney general of Connecticut, Ajit Jain of Berkshire Hathaway, then-Superintendent Eric Dinallo of the New York State Insurance Department, and a Moody's representative were also in attendance.|$|R
