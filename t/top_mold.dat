40|$|The {{increased}} functionality {{of cellular}} phones and handheld devices requires system level integration. Thus {{there is a}} strong demand in cell phone maker to move to embedded micro wafer level packaging (EMWLP). But the major problem encountered is die shift during compression molding. This paper presents a novel method to predict the die shift during wafer level molding process. A series of parametric studies are performed by changing the die thickness, die pitch distance and <b>top</b> <b>mold</b> chaste compression velocity. The effect of thinning down the chip thickness affects the pressure difference and local shear rate on the chip surfaces. The rate of change of epoxy mold compound fluid pressure across the die top surfaces is not constant. The local shear rate is increasing linearly from the centre of the wafer to the outermost die. From the parametric studies, the die shift is inversely proportional to the die thickness for wafer level molding. Such a phenomenon will reduce the lithography alignment error in the next process. This paper also shows that by reducing die pitch distance of a 5 × 5 mm 2, 500 μm thick chip, the die shift decreases by a factor of 12 %. In addition, the <b>top</b> <b>mold</b> chaste compression velocity contributes to the die shift by as much as 28 % when the velocity is reduced by 50 % from 100 μm/sec to 50 μm/sec Finally it is observed from experiment result that the die shift is not constant in all directions. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The FDM {{numerical}} simulation software, ViewCast system, {{was employed to}} simulate the {{low pressure die casting}} (LPDC) of an aluminum wheel. By analyzing the mold-fi lling and solidifi cation stage of the LPDC process, the distribution of liquid fraction, temperature field and solidification pattern of castings were studied. The potential shrinkage defects were predicted to be formed at the rim/spoke junctions, which is in consistence with the X-ray detection result. The distribution pattern of the defects has also been studied. A solution towards reducing such defects has been presented. The cooling capacity of the mold was improved by installing water pipes both in the side mold and the <b>top</b> <b>mold.</b> Analysis on the shrinkage defects under forced cooling mode proved that adding the cooling system in the mold is an effective method for reduction of shrinkage defects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the feasibility of}} creating a hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array by compression molding. This affordable and high precision microlens array design has potential applications in the optical industry for its capability of correcting chromatic aberration. In this research a doublet design was investigated. Specifically, polycarbonate and P-SK 57 glass were selected as the equivalents of flint and crown glass for their opposite dispersion properties. Ultraprecision diamond machining was utilized to manufacture the mold with an asymmetric pattern. The optical quality in the mold surface was obtained without post-machining-polishing. Both the glass and polymer microlens arrays were fabricated by thermal compression molding at different forming temperatures. After the glass microlens array was molded, it {{was used as the}} <b>top</b> <b>mold</b> half for polymer compression molding. Two chisel-shaped cavities were fabricated simultaneously when the glass lens ar ray mold was machined. These two cavities were used as fiducial marks for assembling the P-SK 57 glass part and the polycarbonate part during the second molding action. The single uninterrupted operation was developed in this study to create both optical surfaces and the fiducial marks such that high assembly tolerance could be achieved. Furthermore, numerical simulation for compression molding was conducted to study the geometry profile error of the microlens. Finally, the geometry and optical measurements were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array...|$|E

25|$|The window {{treatments}} {{were another}} area of disagreement between du Pont and Boudin. Du Pont wanted the window treatments inside the window frame, to expose the moldings. Boudin felt this made the room appear too tall. After the two discussed the issue in early 1961, du Pont's view won out. But in late 1962, Boudin removed these window treatments and implemented one he had used many times before in many different homes: Straight panels to hide the side moldings, with a Baroque Revival flat panel to cover the <b>top</b> <b>molding</b> and rods. The fabric used was the same Boudin had selected for the wall covering, but trimmed with a French-made decorative silver tape.|$|R

25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the <b>top</b> core <b>mold</b> (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the <b>top</b> rim <b>mold</b> to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|R

25|$|The oldest records found {{indicate}} that this structure was built in 1885 consisting of a one-story building organized around two identical anterior courtyards. This original spatial distribution is still preserved. The southern half was altered in 1928 after the 1918 earthquake damaged part of this side. During this remodeling a second story was added to this half. This southern facade is set back from the street by a fence and front yard. Its main element is the entrance portico articulated by flat tuscan pilasters and three arches, the central one slightly protruding to the front (This portico {{is part of the}} original 1885 construction). Over the portico, separated by cornice and parapet with the building's name in sans serif letters. Other decorative elements at this level include overhangs, a segmental round cornice over the recessed center window, louvered casement windows with segmental round openings and plain glass transoms and a rosette on top of the center recess between the two volumes. In contrast, the first floor of this south facade presents large rectangular windows with wide planar moldings and a simple cornice with a segmental pyramidal profile on the <b>top</b> <b>molding,</b> a cornice and rectangular windows with false segmental arch crowned by an equally false keystone all part of the original 1885 construction.|$|R
5000|$|As stated above, the altarpiece {{consisted}} {{of more than}} just the main panel. The <b>top</b> <b>molding</b> (now in the Galleria Nazionale dell’Umbria in Perugia) had a panel of [...] "God the Father in a glory of cherubim, blessing his son." [...] The main panel itself had a frame, parts of which still survive, decorated by griffins' being crowned and fed by winged putti seated on rams’ heads, all of a yellow-bronze color against a blue ground (the Baglioni family crest was a griffin’s head, as well as the name of Atalanta’s husband and son being Grifonetto). Below there was a predella of three grisaille (monochrome) compartments illustrating the Theological Virtues (1507. Oil on panel, three sections of 18 x 44 cm each. Rome, Vatican Gallery). The three panels were originally lined up {{at the base of the}} altarpiece to show, left to right, Hopehttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009c.jpg, Charityhttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009b.jpg, and Faithhttp://images.zeno.org/Kunstwerke/I/big/1700009a.jpg, with each figure flanked by two putti. The subjects of the predellas are meant to relate symbolically to the main panel above: Charity in the center emphasizes the theme of motherhood, while Hope and Faith refer to the principle motif, Christ’s martyrdom. Thus Raphael’s conception not only refers to the theme of the altarpiece, but also to the private circumstances of the donor, Atalanta Baglioni.|$|R
