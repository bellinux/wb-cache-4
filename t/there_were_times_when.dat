5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} {{attacks against}} tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages {{not involved in the}} original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E

In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.|$|E

25|$|Scrope v Grosvenor (1389) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} heraldic law cases brought in England. The case resulted from the fact that two different families were using the same undifferenced coat of arms. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the composition of coats of arms was very simple. Most shields consisted of only one charge and two tinctures, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> two families bore the same coat of arms in the same jurisdiction. In the fourteenth century, though, cases of two unrelated families bearing the same coat of arms became less tolerated. When this happened, the monarch was usually called on to make a decision.|$|E

Afolayan {{in an interview}} with Weekend Magazine expressed that it was very stressful shooting October 1 and his previous films were incomparable to it. He stated that it was more challenging, more demanding and it has a budget of over four times that of his previous film. He also said <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> he and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is grateful for that. The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E

Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder.

25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E

He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England.

500|$|Even {{when the}} film was given less than stellar press, Kurrle's work was often praised, {{as in the case}} of the 1929 film Her Majesty, Love, where it was noted, [...] "The story is negligible, the cast, though capable, has nothing to do, and the {{direction}} is heavy handed and slow. But Robert Kurrle's cinematography is outstanding." [...] That same year, his camerawork on another Carewe film, an adaptation of Longfellow's Evangeline, was deemed as [...] "beautiful" [...] by the Film Daily.

500|$|The varied {{meanings}} of lesbian {{since the early}} 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities.

When considering past relationships within appropriate historic context, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> love and sex were separate and unrelated notions. In 1989, an academic cohort named the Lesbian History Group wrote: Because of society's reluctance to admit that lesbians exist, {{a high degree of}} certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label.

[...] Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder.

Employing the digital backlot technique, Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using bluescreens. Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder's direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book, and other times when he gave actors freedom [...] "to explore within the world and the confines that had been set."
