5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> shows that they teem {{with a wide variety}} of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks Galaxolide (HHCB) these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, the EU's Priority Substances Review, the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk and more recently also the US EPA. The outcome of all of these reviews over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{is that there is no}} safety concerns for human health.

2500|$|The term [...] "traditional" [...] (masorti) is {{most common}} as a {{self-description}} among Israeli families of [...] "eastern" [...] origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, {{has nothing to}} do with the Conservative Judaism, which also names itself [...] "Masorti" [...] outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways [...] "secular" [...] and [...] "traditional" [...] are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term [...] "Orthodox" [...] is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora. What would be called [...] "Orthodox" [...] in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati (religious) or haredi (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called [...] "Religious Zionism" [...] or the [...] "National Religious" [...] community, as well as what has become known over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as haredi-leumi (nationalist haredi), or [...] "Hardal", which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in Yiddish, also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as frum, as opposed to frei (more liberal Jews)).|$|E
6000|$|The {{worst of}} scandals becomes romantic and even respectable in two {{thousand}} years; witness that of Cleopatra with Cæsar, Mark Antony and other gentlemen. The most virtuous read of Cleopatra with sympathy, even in boarding-schools, {{and it is}} felt that were she by some miracle to be blotted out {{of the book of}} history, the loss would be enormous. The same applied to Helen, Phryne, and other bad lots. In fact now that one comes to think of it, most of the attractive personages in history, male or female, especially the latter, were bad lots. When we find someone to whose name is added [...] "the good" [...] we skip.
