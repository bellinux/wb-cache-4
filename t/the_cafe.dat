5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted to take over <b>the</b> <b>café</b> business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas {{did not have the}} economical capacity to run <b>the</b> <b>café</b> with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate <b>the</b> <b>café,</b> arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of <b>the</b> <b>café.</b> On 1 January 2010, the operation of <b>the</b> <b>café</b> and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{the street}} became a centre for nightclubs, {{attracting}} clientele such as Edward, Prince of Wales, Rudolph Valentino, Noël Coward, Fred Astaire and Charlie Chaplin. <b>The</b> <b>Café</b> de Paris opened in 1924 {{in the basement}} of the Rialto Cinema (which had opened in 1913) and became a popular club through the rest of the decade because of the owner Martin Poulsen's friendship with the Prince of Wales.
