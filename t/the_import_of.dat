As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E
40|$|Similar {{products}} are imported at different prices, suggesting that varieties are vertically differentiated between {{low and high}} quality. This differentiation of varieties according to their quality enables to provide new evidence regarding the collapse of world trade during the recent crisis. The decrease of world demand has affected <b>the</b> <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> high quality varieties to a larger extent, leading to a decrease <b>of</b> <b>import</b> prices. Our econometric estimations {{over a period of}} ten years confirm that <b>the</b> revenue elasticity <b>of</b> <b>import</b> quantity is larger for high quality imports. Hence, a decrease of world revenue is expected to decrease more <b>the</b> world <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> high quality as compared with <b>the</b> <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> low quality.

5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. <b>The</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. <b>The</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> foreign books to also prohibit <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E

Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> pine trees.

Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as other countries like China, Japan, India, Turkey and South American nations.|$|E
5|$|Economic life in {{the towns}} was {{subsequently}} brought {{under the control of}} entrepreneurial Bugis, Makassarese, and Butonese immigrants from South Sulawesi, while East Timor products were exported under partnerships between army officials and Indonesian businessmen.

The group's most profitable business, however, was its monopoly on the export of coffee, which was the territory's most valuable cash crop. Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non-Denok/military enterprises, and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports.|$|E

Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>of</b> animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
