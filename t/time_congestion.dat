40|$|Abstract — The Engset {{model has}} been {{extensively}} studied and widely used for blocking probability evaluation in telecom-munications networks. In 1957, J. W. Cohen considered two generalizations of the Engset model: 1) Permitting the distributions of the holding time and inter-arrival time to differ from source to source; 2) Permitting the idle time distribution to depend {{on whether or not}} the previous call was successful. He derived the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> for the first general-ization, however, he simply posed the second generalization as a problem. In a leading teletraffic text by Syski, the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> are approximated for the second generalization, though it appears that Syski has overlooked that his results are in fact an approximation. In this paper, we point out Syski’s apparent oversight, we improve the accuracy of his approximation, and we provide an efficient algorithm for its numerical computation and prove its convergence.

Although Lake Street was extensively widened prior to the completion of the highway, initially to Glen Ellyn Road and then to the Roselle-Bloomingdale border nearly ten years later, its capacity was still insufficient for the rapidly growing western suburbs. Construction on the highway began around 1991 and was completed two years later. Governor Jim Edgar opened the highway at an afternoon ceremony on November 2, 1993.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the potentially negative impacts of an increasing deployment of non-congestion-controlled besteffort {{traffic on the}} Internet. 1 These negative impacts range from extreme unfairness against competing TCP traffic to the potential for congestion collapse. To promote the inclusion of end-to-end congestion control {{in the design of}} future protocols using besteffort traffic, we argue that router mechanisms are needed to identify and restrict the bandwidth of selected high-bandwidth best-effort flows in <b>times</b> of <b>congestion.</b> The paper discusses several general approaches for identifying those flows suitable for bandwidth regulation. These approaches are to identify a highbandwidth flow in <b>times</b> of <b>congestion</b> as unresponsive, “not TCPfriendly,” or simply using disproportionate bandwidth. A flow that is not “TCP-friendly ” is one whose long-term arrival rate exceeds that of any conformant TCP in the same circumstances. An unresponsive flow is one failing to reduce its offered load at a router in response to an increased packet drop rate, and a disproportionate-bandwidth flow is one that uses considerably more bandwidth than other flows in a <b>time</b> of <b>congestion.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|Westwood+ is a sender-side only {{modification}} of the TCP Reno protocol stack that optimizes the performance of TCP congestion control over both wireline and wireless networks. TCP Westwood+ is based on end-to-end bandwidth estimation to set congestion window and slow start threshold after a congestion episode, that is, after three duplicate acknowledgments or a timeout. The bandwidth is estimated by properly low-pass filtering the rate of returning acknowledgment packets. The rationale of this strategy is simple: in contrast with TCP Reno, which blindly halves the congestion window after three duplicate ACKs, TCP Westwood+ adaptively sets a slow start threshold and a congestion window which {{takes into account the}} bandwidth used at the <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is experienced. TCP Westwood+ significantly increases throughput over wireless links and fairness compared to TCP Reno/New Reno in wired networks.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the multiserver loss queuing model recently developed by Peake and Pearce (that extends the classical Poisson model to general arrival time distributions) in deriving bounds on traffic service in the Modernised High Frequency Communication System (MHFCS) being built for the Australian Defence Force. The MHFCS is a four-node virtual high frequency (HF) network that interconnects land-based users with mobile land, sea and air platforms. The problem of maximal <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is considered for this system, where general arrival-time distributions can be used to model different traffic classes, where individual voice call and data traffic iteminter-arrival times are identically and independently distributed. The service facility (viz Network Management Node) consists of a fixed number of homogeneous servers (channels) in parallel, each characterized by independent exponential service times. An arrival finding no server available is lost. The <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is the equilibrium proportion of the time that all the servers are busy. Of additional interest are the associated optimisation problems of finding the arrival time distribution functions that maximise and minimise the <b>time</b> <b>congestion,</b> and the corresponding minimal and maximal congestion values. 1.

40|$|In this lesson, {{we learn}} about models used for {{circuit-switched}} networks. We start with an M/M/m/ m model, also called the m-server loss system [1]. We note here that [2], page 379 states that a system with a finite customer population will always be stable, no matter what value of ρ. This statement is made for any finite state space MC. Does this explain why in M/M/m/m model we often talk about ρ being 1, 10, 100 - see [3], pg. 235. Unlike in the M/M/m case, here ρ or offered load is defined to be λ ⁄ µ. In the M/M/m case, recall, we defined ρ to be λ ⁄ (mµ). In Section 1, we derive the Erlang-B formula for an infinite population. In Section 2, we derive the simple <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> or blocking probability for a finite population model, called the Engset for-mula. In Section 3, we show the difference between call congestion or call loss probability and <b>time</b> <b>congestion.</b> For these two sections, refer to [6], page 518 - 521. Both [4] and [6] refer to [5] for the dif-ference between <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> and call congestion. Section 4 describes the recursion formulation for numerically computing the Engset call loss probabilities from [4]. Section 5 derives the Blocked Call Queueing (BCQ) equations. Only the system in Section 1 is characterized using the queueing theory notation. In Sections 2 - 5, we are modeling {{a system in which}} the number of sources is limited. There is no place to indicate the number of sources from which jobs arrive in the Kendall notation. The last two numbers are for num-ber of servers, and number of jobs in the system. Thus the BCQ derivation for mean waiting delay is different from the mean delay derivations for M/M/ 1, M/M/m type queues that we learned in an ear-lier lesson. This lesson is entirely on the single-link case and is hence more about TDM/FDM sharing on a single link rather than circuit-switched networks...|$|E
