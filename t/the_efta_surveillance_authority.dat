The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline.

One Member of Parliament has criticized the government for the delay. He had argued that the initial VAT exemption for all electric vehicles was never approved in ESA.

Data related to the implementation of the Norwegian feed ban were collected and assessed. The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM) was used in order to answer the second term of reference of the mandate received. It is concluded that the use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants might have had a potential impact on the risk of cattle exposure to BSE in Norway. While it is not possible to quantitatively assess this risk, the lack of detection of BSE cases by the Norwegian monitoring system (in spite of its sensitivity limits) suggests that BSE has not significantly spread in the Norwegian cattle population. The proposed revised Norwegian BSE monitoring regime would not be able to meet a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult cattle population at a confidence level of 95 %. Moreover, in statistical terms it is not feasible for Norway to achieve the requested design prevalence. It is furthermore highlighted that passing from a sample-based to an exhaustive monitoring scheme (i. e. testing all animals over a certain age that are slaughtered or dead) would provide the most sensitive BSE surveillance system currently possible...|$|R

The Court upheld a decision by ESA finding that Norway Post had abused its dominant position {{in the market for}} business-to-consumer parcel services with over-the-counter delivery in Norway by pursuing an exclusivity strategy with preferential treatment when establishing and maintaining its Postin-Shop network. The facts of the case were as follows. In 2000 and 2001, Norway Post concluded framework agreements with several undertakings with a view to establish its Post-in-Shop network. Certain agreements specifically excluded competitors in the market for business-to-consumer parcel services from access to any of the outlets in these chains, while others guaranteed Norway Post exclusivity in the outlets which hosted a Post-in-Shop. Due to these exclusivity obligations, once the main roll-out of the Post-in-Shop concept had been implemented towards the end of 2003, Norway Post’s competitors were foreclosed from approximately 50% of all outlets belonging to grocery store, kiosk and petrol station chains in Norway. Furthermore, from 2004 to 2006, Norway Post negotiated preference status questions with its partners for the period subsequent to the expiry of those agreements in 2006. While Norway Post did not actively link the negotiations on preference status with the exclusivity obligations, it did not announce to its partners that it would not maintain such clauses in future cooperation agreements. In its judgment, the Court held that the proceedings, which had led to the imposition of a substantial fine on the applicant, as a matter of principle, must respect the guarantees for criminal proceedings enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In particular, the right to a fair trial requires that the Court must be able to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and of law, the challenged decision. Furthermore, it follows from the principle of the presumption of innocence that the undertaking to which the decision finding an infringement was addressed must be given the benefit of the doubt. As a consequence, the Court rejected ESA’s submission that its review of complex economic assessments by ESA would be limited to a “manifest error” standard. In substance, the Court upheld ESA’s assessment of Norway Post’s conduct. The Court dismissed Norway Post’s arguments that the exclusivity clauses were objectively necessary for the efficient implementation of the Post-in-Shop concept.|$|R
40|$|This Master's {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} development of the conditions for concession for acquisition of hydropower resources between 2000 and 2008. During this period the Norwegian hydropower resources came under pressure. The goal {{of this study is to}} understand the mechanism of the whole political process. The method used here is qualitative, based on document analysis and an interview. There has been a broad political concensus on the public ownership of hydropower resources. The tradition in favour of a strong public ownership can be traced back to the beginning of the 20 th century. The legal right to concession for acquisition of hydropower resources introduced in 1909, was linked to the public sector. While public owners recieved perpetual concessions, private ones were limited. After the end of the concession period, waterfalls and power plants went to the state without compensation. The concession for acquisition scheme meant that most of the hydropower was in public ownership. In spite of minor modifications this scheme remained unchanged for almost hundred years. Both the deregulation of the energy market in the 1990 s and the EEA agreement in 1992 were determining factors in <b>the</b> <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Authority(ESA) setting a limit for the Norwegian scheme on concession to hydropower resources in 2000. In their view, the private hydropower owners were discriminated against in favour of the public counterparts. To be more precise, it referred to this state of affairs as a break against the principle of free enterprise and free movement of capital as established in the EEA law. Two different governments with unlike points of view on the acquisition and concession issue handled the case between 2000 and 2008. Norway and the ESA could not reach an agreement and the case came before <b>the</b> <b>EFTA</b> court in 2007. Norway lost and had to change the rights to concession for acquisition of hydropower resources. In 2008 this case came to and end when the Norwegian government agreed to exploit the premises in the court decision. Public ownership of hydropower resources was strengthened. The development of the case for conditions for concession and acquisition of hydropower resources was marked by two parallel and continuous lines. These were the Norwegian energy policy and the relationship between Norway and the EU. Hydropower has been described as Norway's heritage. This metaphor says something about how significant hydropower has been in society over several generations...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1982 and 1984, Carl Baundenbacher was a Legal Secretary at Bulach District Court, Switzerland. He {{served as}} a member of the Supreme Court of the Principality of Liechtenstein between 1994 and 1995. In 1995 he was {{appointed}} Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) upon a proposal of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Since 2003 Baudenbacher has served as the Court's President. <b>The</b> <b>EFTA</b> Court hears cases originating from <b>the</b> <b>EFTA</b> States which are Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement (currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The EEA Agreement has extended the EU single market to those EFTA States. It is based in a two pillar approach. Both pillars, the EU pillar and <b>the</b> <b>EFTA</b> pillar, have their own <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> and their own court. EEA law which has been implemented into the legal orders of the EEA/EFTA States is capable of having direct effect and eventually takes precedence over conflicting national law. <b>The</b> <b>EFTA</b> Court has also recognized EEA State liability. Moreover, EEA law must be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights. <b>The</b> <b>EFTA</b> Court is bound by homogeneity rules to follow or to take into account relevant ECJ case law. In the majority of its cases, it is, however, faced with novel legal questions and consequently has to ‘go first.’ There are countless references by the ECJ, its Advocates General, the General Court and high courts in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Switzerland. In practice, the one-sided written homogeneity rules have largely been superseded by a [...] "unique judicial dialogue" [...] (ECJ Advocate General Verica Trstenjak). President Baudenbacher participated in roughly 250 cases stemming from the whole range of EEA law, from fundamental freedoms (goods, persons, services, self-employed and companies, capital) to competition law and State aid law to harmonized economic law).
