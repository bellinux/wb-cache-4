UnitedHealth {{withdrew from the}} Georgia and Arkansas exchanges for 2017, citing heavy losses. Humana exited other markets, leaving it operating in 156 counties in 11 states for 2017. 225 counties across the country had access to only a single ACA insurer. A study released in May estimated that 664 counties would have one insurer in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Linx AB was {{a railway}} company which {{operated}} inter-Scandinavian passenger trains between 2001 and 2004. Established as {{a joint venture}} between the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and the Swedish state-owned SJ, Linx operated the routes from Oslo, Norway, to Stockholm, Sweden, and from Oslo via Gothenburg, Sweden, to Copenhagen, Denmark. Services were provided up to ten times per day. However, slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in Norway, combined with competition from low-cost airlines, caused the company <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money,</b> and eventually grounded operations. The services were taken over by NSB and SJ. The main rolling stock were eleven X2 electric multiple units, although it used SJ Rc-hauled trains on the Gothenburg–Oslo service. The company was based in Gothenburg.|$|E

5|$|The {{football}} team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1, 1874, with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887. By the 1940s, Georgetown {{had one of}} the better college {{football team}}s in America, and played in the 1941 Orange Bowl, where they lost 147 to Mississippi State. As the college game became more expensive after World War II, however, Georgetown's program began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> rapidly. The Hoyas last successful season was 1949, when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western. However the program was losing too much money, and on March 22, 1951, the university's president canceled the football program.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a {{successful}} independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, by being in the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players {{in an effort to}} raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money.</b> Following the repeat last place finish, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money,</b> though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E

With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money.</b> Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
5|$|Mayor West {{passes a}} law to legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
50|$|After {{purchasing}} the 10-acre property in 2005, owners Christine Coletta and Steve Lornie grew the existing Red Delicious apples and apricots for one season before switching to Pinot gris in 2006. The pair named the winery Switchback as it celebrated “the switch from <b>losing</b> <b>money</b> as apple growers <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>money</b> as grape growers.” The name Haywire comes from wire, originally used for baling hay, which tended to tangle in a chaotic way. The term also describes Coletta and Lornie's transition from city slickers to farmers to winery owners. After the first vintage in 2009, Haywire planned to source other varieties like Pinot noir from other growers in the valley.|$|R

5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money.</b> It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E
5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> and Jobs, {{as chairman of}} the board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story would probably be a hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{nuclear tests}} in the Pacific were causing {{radioactive}} rainstorms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout, with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, Record of a Living Being, was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of {{the prospect of a}} nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend Fumio Hayasaka died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, Masaru Sato, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. Record of a Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> during its original theatrical run. Today, it is {{considered by many to be}} among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>money</b> in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E
