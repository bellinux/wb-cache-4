5|$|On 1 September 1910, {{the design}} board chose the 30.5cm, to be mounted in four twin turrets on the {{centerline}} of the ship. <b>The</b> <b>armor</b> layout was kept {{the same as in}} Seydlitz. In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>armor</b> {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} alternate armors that Stark uses in special occasions, including <b>the</b> Silver Centurion <b>Armor,</b> <b>the</b> Stealth <b>Armor</b> and <b>the</b> Hulkbuster <b>armor</b> (which was originally named <b>the</b> Dynamo Buster <b>armor).</b>|$|R

Sixteen fortifications on the line were fully manned, and another two were partially manned.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. The suit is functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of <b>the</b> <b>armor.</b> The armor's features include a system that purifies air, powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. <b>The</b> <b>armor</b> offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed that {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E

5|$|The Sinai {{garrison}} numbered 18,000 men. The overall commander was Shmuel Gonen, {{who served}} {{as head of the}} Israeli Southern Command.

5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of penetrating <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration.

When wearing a Jack <b>Armor,</b> <b>the</b> wearer's uncovered portions will not suffer damage even if <b>the</b> <b>armors</b> are destroyed.

5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm thick, with 35mm thick sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm thick and sides 100mm thick. The inner layer of <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> belt was 50mm thick in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern and bow. The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing {{at both ends of}} the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm thick, the faces were 80mm thick, the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. <b>The</b> <b>armor</b> protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm thick.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze.

Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E

5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under Lend-Lease, {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended for China. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency situations, like in Alaska. <b>The</b> <b>armor</b> was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Design work on {{the class}} began in 1892 and lasted until 1894. The ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III class marked a {{significant}} departure from the previous s. Influenced by the Japanese cruisers' victory over a heavier-armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu, heavy-caliber guns designed to penetrate armor were abandoned and replaced with smaller quick-firing guns. These guns were intended to raze the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew. The propulsion system was improved and reorganized to incorporate a third propeller shaft. <b>The</b> <b>armor</b> system, however, remained similar to that employed on the Brandenburgs.|$|E

5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for <b>the</b> <b>armor,</b> but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked <b>the</b> <b>armor</b> characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Sinai, {{a company}} established itself along the coastal road between Romani and Baluza on October 6. The following day, it ambushed Colonel Natke Nir's armored brigade, part of Adan's division, destroying around 18 tanks {{along with other}} vehicles. The coastal road was blocked for over five hours. Airborne Israeli infantry was committed to support <b>the</b> <b>armor,</b> and in the ensuing battle, another 12 tanks and 6 half-tracks were destroyed. Some 30 soldiers of the brigade were killed, while the Sa'iqa company lost 75 dead. In addition to delaying Israeli reserves, commandos carried out sabotage operations.|$|E
