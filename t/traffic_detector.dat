50|$|In some {{instances}} the stoplight <b>traffic</b> <b>detector</b> {{will not change}} the light for small vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters and particularly bicycles, because the induction loop sensor fails to detect the small vehicle. A vehicle with sufficient mass of metal such as steel interacts with the sensor's magnetic field causing the light to change at the appropriate time. Motorcycles and scooters have much less mass than cars, resulting in a failure to detect the vehicle, while bicycles {{may not even be}} constructed with metal. This situation most often occurs at the times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic. Most sensor traffic lights are capable of detecting these vehicles, but are not properly adjusted or calibrated initially, after road construction such as re-surfacing, or set too high in an attempt to avoid false triggers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{intelligent}} <b>traffic</b> sign <b>detector</b> using adaptive learning based on online gathering of training samples from in-vehicle camera image sequences. To detect traffic signs accurately from in-vehicle camera images, various training samples of traffic signs are needed. In addition, to reduce false alarms, various background images {{should also be}} prepared before constructing the detector. However, since their appearances vary widely, {{it is difficult to}} obtain them exhaustively by manual intervention. Therefore, the proposed method simultaneously obtains both traffic sign images and background images from in-vehicle camera images. Especially, to reduce false alarms, the proposed method gathers back-ground images that were easily mis-detected by a previously constructed <b>traffic</b> sign <b>detector,</b> and re-trains the detector by using them as negative samples. By using retrospectively tracked traffic sign images and background images as posi-tive and negative training samples, respectively, the proposed method constructs a highly accurate <b>traffic</b> sign <b>detector</b> auto-matically.

In order {{to gauge the}} total effects, this study applies a sequential modeling approach in which average speed and speed variance models are first estimated, based on roadway design, use and speed limit information. Then, crash counts (of varying severity) are estimated, based on the speed estimates, design, and use variables. The four years of data come from 63, 937 “homogeneous ” roadway segments along 7 interstates and 143 state highways in Washington State.
