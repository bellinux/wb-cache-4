That's what he wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the {{following}} morning, both men reasoned {{that they would}} have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with [...] "We’ve got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show." [...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame.

Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s why I came up with this compromise." [...] Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen: [...] "I'm going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>right</b> now that I can pay him or play him. I can ice you guys."
