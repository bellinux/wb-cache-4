5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania.

5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. <b>The</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.

5|$|The Ministry of Justice {{was headed}} by a Minister who was elected by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet between seasons, and {{authenticated}} by a Supreme Soviet convocation. Deputy Ministers were elected by the Council of Ministers; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed {{his or her own}} department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the Board of the Ministry of Justice. <b>The</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were as a rule implemented nationwide.

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming {{to be faithful to}} the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movement formed {{an important component of the}} conspiracy.|$|E
