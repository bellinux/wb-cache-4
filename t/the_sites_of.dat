40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of the concepts of political power, structure and agency in the study of International Relations. It argues that mainstream IR theory has yet to incorporate the main findings of critical theories, such as post-modernism and feminism, into its analytical toolbox. It will offer the author's own theory of world power, which combines a Foucaultian with a structurationist approach to argue for the existence of four-faced power relationships across twelve interdependent <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> material and cognitive power: i) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> time; ii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> space; iii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> knowledge and aesthetics; iv) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> morality and emotion; v) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> identities; vi) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body; vii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> welfare; viii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> culture/cultural life; ix) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> civic associations; x) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy; xi) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organisation of violence and coercive relations; and xii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> regulatory and legal institutions. These power relations operate at multiple levels of agency across world society, from the individual through to world polities, as well as across <b>the</b> twelve <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> power interdependently. <b>The</b> case of HIV/AIDS is then used to illustrate the necessity of broadening mainstream conceptions of power in International Relations...|$|R

Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

5|$|Excavations at Gedi have {{uncovered}} numerous artifacts, {{but the most}} abundant and commonly discussed in literature are beads and ceramics, which {{have been used to}} identify trade and to obtain dates for the site's occupation. Many of the names given to the stone houses refer to the objects found within or in association with them including two Chinese coins, a porcelain bowl, scissors, a Venetian Bead, cowrie shells, an iron lamp, and an iron box. The material remains found at Gedi {{have been found to be}} similar to the remains at adjacent Swahili coastal settlements with the greatest degree of variation among the styles of pottery represented. Of eight sites examined by Kirkman, <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> Gedi, Ungwana, and Kilepwa had nearly identical material remains prior to the fifteenth century, while <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> Mnarani, the Pillar Tomb at Malindi, Takwa, Kinuni, and Kilindidni increasingly similar material culture over the course of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In addition to local production, one of the major contributors to the presence of cultural materials found at the site is due to the importance of Indian Ocean trade, which assumed a growing role in East Africa at the beginning of the Islamic era in the seventh century.|$|E
