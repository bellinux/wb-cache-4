5|$|Negotiations on {{continuing}} the coalition broke down the next day, apparently over demands from the Social Democratic Alliance {{to take over}} the leadership of the government, and Geir Haarde tendered the government's resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>asked</b> the present government to continue until a new government can be formed, and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1941, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> {{for more}} detail {{regarding}} allocation of aircraft based on estimates of peacetime production {{for the next}} nine months.

25|$|Inside DEST Tower on Roboworld, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>asks</b> Secretary of Defense Titan for {{a report}} about ships landing on Roboworld's moon, EUЯPSS (pronounced Europass) - a de-militarized zone that Roboworld signed away to {{refugees}} in the M-3 Nebula Federation, making it off limits to Roboworld's troops. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> obtains a verbal oath from Colonel Volton to—fight to the death—to protect Roboworld and the M-3 Nebula.|$|R
25|$|After {{entering}} {{the park and}} seeing the magnificent splendor of the valley, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> Muir to show him the real Yosemite. Muir and Roosevelt set off largely by themselves and camped in the back country. The duo talked late into the night, slept in the brisk open air of Glacier Point, and were dusted by a fresh snowfall in the morning. It was a night Roosevelt never forgot.|$|E
500|$|Foraker {{supported}} President Wilson as {{he moved}} the nation closer to intervention in World War I. [...] In April 1917, Foraker {{was one of a}} group of Cincinnatians who organized to support Wilson when <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>asked</b> Congress to declare war on Germany. [...] The former senator's ill-health (he had suffered several heart attacks during the preceding winter) limited his participation. On May 7, Foraker experienced another heart attack in downtown Cincinnati. [...] Taken home, he lapsed in and out of consciousness for three days before dying on May 10, 1917. [...] Hundreds of prominent Cincinnatians attended his interment at Spring Grove Cemetery on May 13.|$|E
500|$|On April 28, Admiral Mullen {{explained}} the final {{plan to the}} NSC. To bolster the [...] "fight your way out" [...] scenario, Chinook helicopters with additional troops would be positioned nearby. Most of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option, but changed his support {{the next day to}} the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.|$|E

500|$|At the Milburn House, McKinley {{seemed to}} be recovering. [...] On Saturday, September 7, McKinley was relaxed and conversational. [...] His wife was allowed to see him, as was Cortelyou; <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>asked</b> his secretary, [...] "How did they like my speech?" [...] and was pleased on hearing of {{positive}} reactions. [...] Meanwhile, Vice President Roosevelt (who had been in Vermont), much of the Cabinet, and Senator Hanna hurried to Buffalo. [...] Cortelyou continued to issue encouraging bulletins. [...] The President was permitted few visitors, and complained of loneliness. [...] As the crisis seemed to have passed, dignitaries started to leave on September 9, confident of the President's recovery. [...] Roosevelt left for a vacation in the Adirondack Mountains after expressing outrage that Czolgosz might serve {{only a few years}} under New York State law for attempted murder, the maximum penalty for attempted murder in New York at that time being ten years. [...] Attorney General Philander Knox went to Washington, searching for a means to bring Czolgosz under federal law. [...] Secretary of State John Hay had been closely associated with the two presidents to be assassinated: [...] he had been Lincoln's secretary, and a close friend of James Garfield. [...] He arrived on September 10; met at the station by Babcock with an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded that the President would die.|$|E

50|$|According to the Hungarian Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Hungary is {{required}} to appoint {{the leader of the}} political party who wins a majority of seats in the National Assembly of Hungary as Prime Minister. If there is no party with a majority, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>asks</b> <b>the</b> leader of the largest party to attempt to form a government coalition.

2500|$|Roosevelt, {{eager to}} ensure public consent for this {{controversial}} plan, {{explained to the}} public and the press that his plan was comparable to one neighbor's lending another a garden hose to put out a fire in his home.

'Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it' …I don't want $15 — I want my garden hose back after the fire is over."

[...] It was reported that even though the protesters broke the TV cameras and threw hand-made bombs at Ahmadinejad, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> the officials not to question or disturb the protesters.

2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the Treaty of Versailles during the Wilson administration marked the dominance of isolationism in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt's Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered {{in the early to}} mid-1930s by Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the [...] "merchants of death" [...] in the U.S. from selling arms abroad. This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts; <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> for, but was refused, a provision to give him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression. In the interim, Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia, and the Italians joined Nazi Germany in supporting the General Francisco Franco and the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. Focused on domestic policy, Roosevelt largely acquiesced to Congress's non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s. But when Japan invaded China in 1937, public opinion strongly favored China, and Roosevelt found various ways to assist that nation.|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, colonial {{governor}} Winship {{argued for}} a light artillery unit. On March 16, 1936, the PRNG underwent a reorganization. In February 1934, Gen. George Leach, who oversaw Company A of the 295th, visited Puerto Rico {{and was surprised to}} see that the bayonets had been repaired motu proprio with local resources and their discipline, promoting him to pronounce during a speech that he had [...] "inspected the national guards of the 48 states" [...] and not seen one better prepared than the PRNG, going to the extent that if <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>asked</b> which was the best regiment for defense, it would be the 295th. The 296th remained {{under the supervision of the}} 295th until June 1, 1936, when it was designated as a regiment under Col. Luis Irizarry. In 1937, the 296th first Battalion was reassigned to the 295th as Company A. In 1938, the PRNG joined the 65th Infantry Regiment and participated in exercises supervised by Gen. Frank Ross McKoy. On July 25, 1938, Irizarry was killed during an assassination attempt against colonial governor Winship in one of several confrontations between the government and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party following the events of the Ponce massacre. Col. José Enrique Colom took over the 296th Regiment.|$|E
60|$|The President frankly {{admitted}} that he was desirous of peace, that he would welcome a cessation of hostilities, but he delicately intimated that if Spain were really desirous of peace she {{must be prepared to}} offer such terms as could be accepted by the United States. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>asked</b> the French ambassador if he had been instructed to formally propose terms, or make any offer.|$|E
