5|$|However, it {{was decided}} that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should instead be based in Strasbourg—the Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, and they did so until 1999, when a new complex of {{buildings}} was built across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> the Palace.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Halfpenny Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} toll bridge, crossing <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Bath Spa railway station to Widcombe collapsed {{with the loss}} of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the Bath and West Agricultural show.|$|E
50|$|Northwest of Missoula, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{continues}} {{through a long}} valley along the northeast flank of the Bitterroot Range, through the Lolo National Forest. It receives <b>the</b> Bitterroot <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south-southwest approximately 5.5 mi west of downtown Missoula. Along the Cabinet Mountains <b>the</b> <b>river</b> receives <b>the</b> Flathead <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east near Paradise. It receives <b>the</b> Thompson <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north near Thompson Falls in southern Sanders County.|$|R
50|$|The Molodo {{originates}} {{in the western}} part of Bulunsky District from as a merger of two <b>rivers,</b> <b>the</b> Molodo-Khangas-Anabyla <b>River</b> and <b>the</b> Molodo-Unga-Anabyla <b>River.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> source it flows southwest, subsequently south, and accepts <b>the</b> Khastakh <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left. Downstream of mouth of the Khastakh the Molodo turns east, accepts <b>the</b> Daldyn <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left and turns southeast. Below the mouth of the Syungude the Molodo turns northwest, accepts <b>the</b> Muogdan <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left and turns right. The mouth of the Molodo is 413 km upstream of the mouth of the Lena. The banks of the Molodo are not inhabited.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> {{receives}} <b>the</b> Big <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south approximately 20 miles (32 km) {{southwest of}} Medfra. It receives the Swift, Stony, and Holitna <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south {{at the southern}} end of the Kuskokwim Mountains before emerging on the coastal plain. It receives <b>the</b> Aniak <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south at Aniak. Approximately 20 miles (32 km) upstream from Bethel it receives the Kisaralik and Kwethluk <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south. It receives <b>the</b> Eek <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east at Eek near its mouth on Kuskokwim Bay.|$|R
5|$|Rowing {{is popular}} on the River Weaver, with {{competitive}} clubs in Runcorn, Northwich, and Acton Bridge (The Grange School). Fishing is another pastime {{which takes place}} along the river. Several clubs lease fishing rights for different parts of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> British Waterways, as it holds populations of bream, three types of carp, chub, dace, eels, perch, pike, roach, rudd and tench. Fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, now {{commanded}} by Brigadier Hugh Bellamy, was given several objectives in the operation. The 2nd OBLI, {{landing in the}} north, had to secure the bridges over the River Issel. The 1st RUR had the main road bridge over <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Hamminkeln to Brunen as their objective, and the 12th Devons were to capture the town of Hamminkeln.|$|E
5|$|The Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge will connect Miller's Landing to Council Bluffs in 2009. A riverfront trail {{will run}} the length of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> the South Omaha Bridge to N.P. Dodge Park.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> TRF <b>River</b> Walk lines <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> {{one end of}} town to <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> walk connects several parks {{including}} the dam, Red Robe Park, and the Northland Woods.|$|R
50|$|It rises {{at about}} 67°N {{latitude}} and 173°E longitude near {{the headwaters of}} <b>the</b> Maly Anyuy <b>River,</b> flows southwest receiving {{the waters of the}} Yablon and Eropol Rivers, turns east and passes Markvovo and the old site of Anadyrsk, turns north and east and receives <b>the</b> Mayn <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south, thereby encircling the Lebediny Zakaznik, turns northeast to receive <b>the</b> Belaya <b>River</b> (Chukotka) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north, turns southeast past the Ust-Tanyurer Zakaznik and receives <b>the</b> Tanyurer <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. At Lake Krasnoye, it turns east and flows into the Onemen Bay of the Anadyr Estuary. If the Onemen Bay is considered part of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> it also receives <b>the</b> Velikaya <b>River</b> (Chukotka) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south and <b>the</b> Kanchalan <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
2500|$|The Manjampatti Valley {{catchment}} basin drains into <b>the</b> Chinnar <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Athioda Stream and to <b>the</b> Amaravathi <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kajadaikatti Odai Ar and Ten Ar <b>Rivers</b> [...] to <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, Wolfe's troops {{landed on}} the south {{bank of the river}} at Point Levis, nearly directly across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Quebec; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{industries}} and stone mines {{on both sides}} of the river were eventually exhausted and closed. Tourists coming up <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Port Jervis became the mainstay of the local economy. During the next two decades, seasonal homes and hotels were built in Pond Eddy.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} on the Nevada side of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Access is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> or <b>from</b> a tramway on the Arizona side of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nina Tilden, {{one of the}} two {{opposition}} stern-wheel steamboats {{that ran}} on <b>the</b> Colorado <b>River</b> <b>from</b> 1864 to 1868. Purchased by George A. Johnson Company it ran on <b>the</b> Colorado <b>River</b> <b>from</b> 1868 until 1874.|$|R
50|$|After the South Fork confluence, {{the main}} stem of <b>the</b> McKenzie <b>River</b> {{continues}} west {{through a narrow}} valley in the mountains, receiving <b>the</b> Blue <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north at the community of Blue <b>River.</b> <b>The</b> McKenzie then passes Vida and continues to Leaburg and Walterville. The McKenzie valley widens as <b>the</b> <b>river</b> continues west, receiving <b>the</b> Mohawk <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northeast just north of Springfield. Emerging from the Cascade foothills, the McKenzie enters a broad floodplain. It joins <b>the</b> Willamette <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east 5 mi north of Eugene.|$|R
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Around 1627, Robert Morton, {{the mayor}} of Hull, had an {{additional}} rectangular earthwork battery of four guns constructed around the south blockhouse to defend the estuary against a potential Spanish and French invasion threat. The South End Fort {{was built on the}} other side of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> the South Blockhouse at the same time, provided supporting crossfire. In 1634, a survey showed the North Blockhouse to be mounting 24 pieces of artillery, the castle 29, and the South Blockhouse 24 guns. Catholic recusants continued to be detained in the castle and blockhouses, where they were ill-treated by the keepers, typically men with strong Puritan sympathies.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{materials}} and short on funds, the palace was initially built {{entirely out of}} wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over {{the next few years}} the king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.|$|E

50|$|The {{municipalities}} {{north of}} <b>the</b> Tagus <b>River</b> are <b>from</b> Lisbon District (Grande Lisboa), those south of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> are <b>from</b> Setubal District (Península de Setúbal).|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Geological Survey {{reports that}} in Nepal, tugtupite (as well as jasper and nephrite) were found {{extensively}} {{in most of}} <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bardia to the Dang.|$|R
5|$|Fort Vancouver, on {{the north}} bank of the Columbia River in what is today Vancouver, Washington, lay across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> what would become Portland, Oregon. It was founded in 1825 by the Hudson's Bay Company chief factor for the area, Dr. John McLoughlin. The company sought furs and other trade goods, and was in {{competition}} with John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company, which had an outpost at what is now Astoria, Oregon. Fort Vancouver was named for the British sea captain George Vancouver, who also gave his name to Vancouver in Canada.|$|E
5|$|From a {{population}} of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971. Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock. Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Avonmouth during the 1970s. As air travel grew {{in the first half of}} the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories. The unsuccessful Bristol International Exhibition was held on Ashton Meadows in the Bower Ashton area in 1914. After the premature closure of the exhibition the site was used, until 1919, as barracks for the Gloucestershire Regiment during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the main}} port {{on the river}} was at Bridgwater, where a span crossed <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> 1200 AD onwards. Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 {{upstream}} of the Town Bridge. A custom house was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|E
50|$|Israel {{sought to}} {{establish}} a line of security settlements along <b>the</b> Jordan <b>river,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Galilee to Beit She'an, {{in order to protect}} its borders. Neve Ur was established opposite <b>the</b> Jordan <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town of Tel esh-Shuneh.|$|R
5000|$|The {{homeland}} of the Sinkiuse {{was based}} on <b>the</b> Columbia <b>River</b> <b>from</b> Crab Creek upstream to <b>the</b> Wenatchee <b>River</b> and centered on Moses Coulee. In 1870, Winans placed them [...] "on the east and south sides of <b>the</b> Columbia <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Grand Coulee down to Priest's Rapids." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1877, in {{connection}} with his commercial fishery, Hume built a hatchery at Ellensburg (Gold Beach), which released fish into the river. In its first year of operation, Hume collected 215,000 salmon eggs and released about 100,000fry. After the first hatchery was destroyed by fire in 1893, Hume built a new hatchery in 1895, and in 1897 he co-operated with the United States Fish Commission in building and operating an egg-collecting station {{at the mouth of}} Elk Creek on the upper Rogue. In 1899, he built a hatchery near Wedderburn, across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> Gold Beach, and until {{the time of his death}} in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from the Elk Creek station.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Territory {{began with}} just three counties: St. Clair (part of present-day Illinois, across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> St Louis {{and south of}} the Illinois River), Randolph County (part of present-day Illinois, south of St. Clair county), and Knox (present-day Indiana, with parts of Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin). There was also an area {{corresponding}} roughly to northern Illinois, much of Wisconsin, the northeastern corner of Minnesota, and the western part of Michigan's upper peninsula that was unorganized.|$|E
5|$|Near the De Peyster–Oswegatchie town line, {{the route}} begins to {{parallel}} the south {{bank of the}} Oswegatchie River as it merges with the alignment of CR10 (Old State Road). From here, NY184 continues alongside the Oswegatchie River into the town of Oswegatchie and its village of Heuvelton {{not far from the}} town line, where the route becomes known as Union Street. As Union Street, NY184 serves a mostly residential stretch of buildings along the riverbank before ending at a junction with NY812 (State Street) across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>from</b> the village center.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> {{continues}} northeast {{to take in}} <b>the</b> North Washagami <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left at {{an elevation}} of 81 m then on to its point furthest north at , before turning southeast for 50 km. Then, within 5 km, three named tributaries join: <b>the</b> Matateto <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right; <b>the</b> Crooked <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right; and <b>the</b> Little Ekwan <b>River</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left. They join at an elevation of about 70 m. <b>The</b> Ekwan <b>River</b> continues east southeast for 160 km, passing over the Flint Rapids at [...] at an elevation of 63 m, before reaching its mouth at sea level at the Akimiski Strait on James Bay, across from the western tip of Akimiski Island, about 25 km north of the mouth of <b>the</b> Attawapiskat <b>River.</b>|$|R
