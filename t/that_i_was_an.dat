I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record.

She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as [...] "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend to hand it to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.|$|E

500|$|Alcorn {{publicly}} revealed her {{attraction to}} males {{when she was}} sixteen, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date. According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled. In Alcorn's words, [...] "They felt like I was attacking their image, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment to them. They {{wanted me to be}} their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted." [...] They removed her from the school, and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school, Ohio Virtual Academy. According to Alcorn, her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide. At {{the end of the school}} year, they returned her phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time – according to Alcorn – her relationship with many of them had become strained and she continued to feel isolated.|$|E

40|$|Are there good {{grounds for}} {{thinking}} that the moral values of action are {{to be derived from}} those of character? This ‘virtue ethical’ claim is sometimes thought of as a kind of normative ethical theory; sometimes as form of opposition to any such theory. However, the best case to be made for it supports neither of these claims. Rather, it leads us to a distinctive view in moral epistemology: the view that my warrant for a particular moral judgement derives from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge. This view seems to confront a regress-problem. For the belief <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge <b>is</b> itself <b>a</b> particular moral judgement. So it seems that, on this view, I need to derive my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good moral judge from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> good judge of moral judges; and so on. I show how this worry can be met, and trace the implications of the resulting view for warranted moral judgement. Garrett Cullit...|$|R

2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If {{you want to say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice. Say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for peace. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|R

2500|$|Following his {{re-election}} in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted {{of the new}} Parliament that [...] "the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see." [...] The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that [...] "Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Independent and could be silent without disloyalty." [...] Herbert campaigned {{to ensure that the}} newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time.

The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you want to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major, say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drum major for justice.

40|$|Most philosophers, {{including}} all materialists I know of, believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing?a thing with parts?and that my mental life <b>is</b> (or <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of) {{the interaction of}} these parts. These philosophers often believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> body or a brain, and my mental life <b>is</b> (or <b>is</b> <b>a</b> product of) brain activity. In this paper, I develop and defend a novel argument against this view. The argument turns on certainty, that highest epistemic status that a precious few of our beliefs enjoy. For example, {{on the basis of}} introspection, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not in fierce pain right now. But if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing like a body or a brain, then introspection might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> causal series of events extended in time. And any such process could go awry. So, if introspection <b>is</b> such <b>a</b> process, then I could gain good evidence that the introspective process has gone awry and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> contrary to appearances, feeling fierce pain right now. Therefore, the view <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> complex thing like a body or a brain forces open the possibility <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>be</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not feeling fierce pain right now. Since that <b>is</b> clearly not <b>an</b> open possibility, it follows <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>a</b> complex thing. I conclude by responding to three objections...|$|R
