5|$|Before {{the light}} was {{automated}} in 1979, people {{were in charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> a continuous basis. The heads and first assistants of the light played a prominent role in carrying out the daily processes of the light.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> {{the small}} rock of Oxcars was {{automated}} {{as early as}} 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks. A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} lighthouse, {{known as}} the Round Tower, was built after the local vicar, either John Goulden in 1764 or Walter Harris in 1799, raised a subscription amongst the local population to replace <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the top of St Andrews Church tower. The four-storey Round Tower was built next to the church. It was taken over and improved by Trinity House in 1815, and operated until 1832, following which the top two storeys were removed.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{known as}} Gage Roads Lighthouse, {{it was the}} first {{lighthouse}} built in the Cockburn area.

On board the Peveril, First Officer Thomas Webb and the Peveril's lookout, A.B. Joseph Corris observed the masthead light and then the port navigation lights of another vessel which could be seen off the Peveril's starboard quarter, with the range decreasing and the bearing remaining constant.|$|E
25|$|The Bell System {{dial service}} {{implemented}} a feature called automatic number identification (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll-free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In manual service, the operator knows where a call is originating by <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it {{on a paper}} toll ticket.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} from the Academy of Applied Science led by Robert H.

A submersible camera with a floodlight was deployed to record images below the surface. If Rines detected anything on the sonar, he turned <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> and took pictures.|$|E

On {{the evening of}} 18 December 1810 Nymphe and , were wrecked off Dunbar {{at the mouth of}} the Firth of Forth. All the crew except nine were saved. Captain Clay and his officers were cleared of blame at the subsequent court martial with the exception of Mr G. Scott, the master, and C. Gascoigne, the pilot, who were judged to have mistaken fires from a lime kiln on shore for <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the Isle of May.|$|E
25|$|Focusing {{the light}} beam {{to a point}} {{on the surface of}} the sample under test, and {{recombining}} the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan), also called full-field OCT.|$|E
25|$|The {{light of}} Greece {{may be another}} {{important}} factor {{in the development of the}} particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail. The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.|$|E
