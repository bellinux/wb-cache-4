50|$|A tire {{rotating}} {{at higher}} speeds tends {{to develop a}} larger diameter, due to centrifugal forces that force the <b>tread</b> <b>rubber</b> away from the axis of rotation.

Motorcycle tires are often designed with reinforcements aimed at minimizing centrifugal growth.|$|E

The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of <b>rubber</b> <b>tread.</b> Shortages of <b>rubber</b> <b>tread</b> can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency.

5000|$|Potential {{benefits}} of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire {{has the potential to}} be able to brake better - a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical and lateral stiffness are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire. [...] Because the <b>tread</b> <b>rubber</b> around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new retreaded passenger car tyres classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without special aggregates mixed into the <b>tread</b> <b>rubber</b> compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum braking friction corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved braking friction and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the <b>tread</b> <b>rubber</b> compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth flooded ice with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|E

Besides, we also analyzed the effects of wall slip coefficients on co-extrusion products. The results show that the decreasing of wall slip coefficients can reduce the extrusion swell phenomenon effectively, but it may bring out the distorting of the corner parts of co-extrusion section shape. Therefore, various factors need to be comprehensive taken into account in the selection of wall slip coefficients...|$|E

40|$|Hydroplaning is {{a driving}} {{phenomenon}} threating vehicle’s control stability and safety. It happens when tire rolls on wet pavement with high speed that hydrodynamic force uplifts the tire. Accurate numerical simulation {{to reveal the}} mechanism of hydroplaning and evaluate the function of relevant factors in this process is significant. In order to describe the friction behaviors of tire-pavement interaction, kinetic friction coefficient curve of tire rubber and asphalt pavement was obtained by combining pavement surface power spectrum and complex modulus of <b>tread</b> <b>rubber</b> through Persson’s friction theory. Finite element model of tire-fluid-pavement was established in ABAQUS, which was composed of a 225 - 40 -R 18 radial tire and three types of asphalt pavement covered with water film.

40|$|The {{response}} of a one-dimensional, coated, aluminum structure {{subjected to a}} unit step pressure wave is studied. The coating is either an elastic material or a viscoelastic <b>tread</b> stock <b>rubber</b> of variable stiffness; it separates the structure from an air or a water medium. The stress and nodal velocity of the structure coated with different materials is compared to a system without a coating (homogeneous system). Both the stress and nodal velocity of the structure increase with a decreasing coating stiffness regardless of the coating type or bounding medium. This phenomenon indicates that the coating stiffness governs the degree of strain energy release from the structure to the medium. A softer coating appears to trap this excess energy increasing the stress in the structure. In all cases studied, the stiffer coating reduced the dynamic {{response of}} the structure {{when compared to the}} homogeneous system.
