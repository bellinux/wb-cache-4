40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various actinide, fission-product, and light-element {{isotopes}} {{associated with}} LWR spent fuel {{with respect to}} five analysis areas: criticality safety (absorption fractions), shielding (dose rate fractions), curies (fractional curies levels), decay heat (fraction of total watts), and radiological toxicity (fraction of potential committed effective dose equivalent). These rankings are presented {{for up to six}} different burnup/enrichment scenarios and at decay times from 2 to 100, 000 years. Ranking plots for each of these analysis areas are given in an Appendix for completeness, as well as summary tables in {{the main body of the}} report. Summary rankings are presented in terms of high (greater than 10 % contribution to the total), medium (between 1 % and 10 % contribution), and low (less than 1 % contribution) for both short- and long-term cooling. When compared with the expected measurement accuracies, these rankings show that most of the important isotopes can be characterized sufficiently for the purpose of radionuclide generation/depletion code validation in each of the analysis areas. Because the main focus of this work is on <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> isotopes associated with L@ spent fuel, some conclusions may not be applicable to similar areas such as high-level waste (HLW) and nonfuel-bearing components (NFBC) ...|$|R

5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town.

While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of {{the tree of life}} into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> {{the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about {{communist}} influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow {{was part of a larger}} tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have {{reported on the}} preference effects of various components of streetscapes. However, {{there appears to be}} relatively little data on <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> those design components on preference. In this paper <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> effects of trees, cars, wires, and building facades on preferences for residential blocks are discussed. Clean estimates of these effects were obtained by combining contemporary digital technology with a formal experimental design. It was found that trees had a moderate positive effect on preferences for streetscapes, wires had a small negative effect, and cars had a trivial effect. It was also found that the effect of building facade ranged from trivial to moderate. ...|$|R

30|$|The EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) {{has been}} used to obtain ion {{velocities}} in the lower thermosphere. By using beam swinging and assuming homogeneity and stationarity of the plasma, first approximations to the electric field have been deduced, and thus the thermospheric neutral wind has been estimated. From these derived parameters, we have estimated the gradient Richardson Number. Although many assumptions must be made, there is an indication that electrodynamics is able to contribute to enhancement or even production of neutral-air turbulence in the lower thermosphere.

Along the large-scale altitudinal gradient nearest to the equator in the Northern Hemisphere (i.e., the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain), we indeed found that all measures of observed taxon richness (i.e., TRobs: Sobs, Gobs, Fobs, TSobs, SSobs, HSobs, ISobs, IISobs, and IIISobs) displayed the hump-shaped patterns (Fig.  5). For all plant groups considered in this study, the taxon richness peaked at the lower elevations, which is consistent with previous reports (VanDerWal et al. 2008).|$|R
