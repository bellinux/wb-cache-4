5000|$|In November 1957, Detroit {{sports writer}} Jerry Green {{credited}} Noskin with <b>turning</b> <b>Van</b> Pelt into a [...] "topnotch quarterback." [...] Green wrote: [...] "Noskin {{was just another}} varsity candidate in the spring. But {{the threat of the}} daring sophomore taking his job away spurred Van Pelt into doing things he never considered before. Most of all, Noskin's passing ability made Van Pelt into a better passer." ...|$|E
50|$|The sole {{remaining}} tie to Ross's {{death is}} Van Dekker, the lone survivor of Hassan's brutal take-down. The cops {{want to bring}} him in for questioning, but he is {{under the protection of}} the FBI. Van Dekker is their link to a Somali arms deal. The U.S. government orchestrated the transfer of illegal arms to Hassan, which are covertly equipped with GPS devices. Hassan will likely provide the weapons to terrorist camps throughout Somalia, and the U.S. government will target and destroy the camps. Agent Wendy Stahl has no intention of <b>turning</b> <b>Van</b> Dekker over to the detectives. Goren, aware of the constraints of pursuing Ross's murder from inside the force, throws a punch at Van Dekker and gets himself suspended. New Major Case detective Serena Stevens, recently arrived from Chicago, witnesses the decisive moment.|$|E

50|$|After his death, Belgian {{athletics}} {{entered a}} long period without athletes with international fame. Together with the athletics event named after him, this <b>turned</b> <b>Van</b> Damme into a national icon and a reminder of a glorious past and missed opportunity. It {{was not until the}} 2000s with the arrival of Kim Gevaert and Tia Hellebaut that Belgian athletics got a boost again.|$|R
50|$|Isaac Makwala (Botswana) had {{qualified}} for the final, but was barred from competing as he was under quarantine due to the norovirus outbreak {{in one of the}} athletes' hotels. Steven Gardiner (Bahamas) started fastest, with Wayde van Niekerk (South Africa) equal to him by about 200 metres, and going on to build a lead through the final <b>turn.</b> <b>Van</b> Niekerk had time to slow down, winning comfortably ahead of Gardiner, with Abdalelah Haroun (Qatar) finishing quickly from dead last off the turn to claim bronze.|$|R
50|$|In the final, {{the three}} {{favorites}} James, van Niekerk and Merritt were drawn in lanes 6, 8 and 5 respectively and {{led from the}} start.

Cedenio was another four metres back, with Taplin another metre back. In the home straight van Niekerk increased his lead while James overtook Merritt, finishing 2nd and 3rd. Cedenio was 4th, Taplin faded and in lane 1, eighteen year-old Karabo Sibanda finished fifth.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{objects and}} {{pictures}} have frequently {{been used as}} communication devices. Many authors have also used picture symbols, such as line drawings and photographs to develop language in individuals {{with little or no}} speech and/or cognitive disabilities. Tangible symbols emerged from Van Dijk’s work in the 1960s using objects as symbols to develop language in deaf-blind children. In <b>turn,</b> <b>Van</b> Dijk’s work was based on the concept [...] "symbol formation" [...] developed by Werner and Kaplan (1963), who theorized that [...] "symbol formation" [...] referred to the process of developing language by creating symbols in our minds.|$|R

50|$|Had he {{written in}} English rather than Dutch, his Description would {{certainly}} have won from posterity the same kind, if not the same amount, of veneration that has been bestowed on Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation. As it <b>turned</b> out, <b>Van</b> der Donck's book was written, published, widely read, put aside, and, alas, almost forgotten long before Bradford's book was published at all.|$|R

50|$|On October 13, 1812, Van Rensselaer {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the British position that would evolve into the Battle of Queenston Heights. Though initially successful, Van Rensselaer's inadequate preparations and his plan of attack were clearly main reasons for what became a major defeat. He was unable to secure the element of surprise, he did not procure enough boats for his men to cross the Niagara River easily, and he was even unable to supply his soldiers with sufficient ammunition. Despite significantly outnumbering the British {{in the early stages of}} the battle, the American soldiers, untried and untrained, sometimes refused to cross to the Canadian side of the river. Once the tide of the battle <b>turned,</b> <b>Van</b> Rensselaer was not even able to coax the boatmen into going back over to rescue the doomed attack force. His forces were badly beaten by British troops under generals Isaac Brock and, after Brock's death, Roger Hale Sheaffe.|$|R

2500|$|According to James Trilling, it [...] "is one of {{the very}} few {{ornamental}} works that deserve recognition as art-historical <b>turning</b> points. <b>Van</b> Vianen's breakthrough was the introduction of inchoate or indeterminate form, which paved the way for both Rococo and modernist ornament." [...] It was raised by a lengthy process of chasing from a single sheet of silver, and chasing was the main technique used in auricular silver.|$|R
