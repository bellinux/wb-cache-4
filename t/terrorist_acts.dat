5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E

5|$|The West German {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the high profile of the prisoners {{and the fact that the}} group had numerous sympathisers, so that <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab states should be denied boarding of Lufthansa flights.|$|E
5|$|V for Vendetta is a 2005 dystopian {{political}} thriller film {{directed by}} James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers, {{based on the}} 1988 DC/Vertigo Comics limited series {{of the same name}} by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. The film is set in an alternative future where a neo-fascist regime has subjugated the United Kingdom. Hugo Weaving portrays V, an anarchist freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts,</b> and Natalie Portman plays Evey, a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission, while Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in {{separate}} occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts.</b> Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks {{to the efforts of}} Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.|$|E

In his view, the media are to a certain degree a catalyst for terrorism because <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> of such a volume would be impossible without them; also, the press induces panic in the organs of state authority and affects the public negatively.|$|E
