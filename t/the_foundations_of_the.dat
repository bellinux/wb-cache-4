5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. <b>The</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E

5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls.

5|$|The Komnenoi {{also made}} a {{significant}} contribution to the history of Asia Minor. By reconquering much of the region, the Komnenoi set back the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries. In the process, they planted <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine successor states of Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E

5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There {{was also a}} portable altar of Purbeck Marble; {{it is likely that}} the Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal {{belief in the}} divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and {{the abolition of the}} monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E

By 1995, numerous Croat-owned houses in Hrvatska Dubica, all Croat-owned houses in Cerovljani and about half the Croat-owned houses in Baćin were torched, dynamited or otherwise destroyed. The Catholic churches in Hrvatska Dubica, Cerovljani and Baćin were destroyed, and <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church destroyed in Hrvatska Dubica were completely removed.|$|E
5|$|Coins of both Carausius and Allectus {{have been}} {{discovered}} buried in <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort's walls. A later coin of 330–335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence – the earlier Saxon Shore forts – and may have decided to augment it {{with the construction of}} Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).|$|E
5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities.

5|$|Despite {{being located}} outside Kyustendil at the time, {{up until the}} {{construction}} of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral. The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; it was mostly destroyed, leaving only <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arches. It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
