60|$|COKESON. [In {{a whisper}} to James] I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> wanted nourishment.|$|E
60|$|There, my dear, I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't want to {{be bothered}} with us.|$|E
60|$|Old Morton (stiffly). I {{have already}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> is an {{appointee}} of my son's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{will prove}} most firm and true," [...] {{answered}} the Astrologer boldly. [...] "I would desire no greater triumph of art over ignorance, than that prediction and its accomplishment will afford.--I <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>he</b> would be faithful in any honourable commission.--Hath {{he not been}} so?--I <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>he</b> would be scrupulous in aiding any evil enterprise.--Hath he not proved so?--If you doubt it, go ask the Bohemian, Hayraddin Maugrabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{why have}} you come beyond him to me? He must know. If <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> is engaged to marry me, he must also have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> {{does not intend to}} marry Miss Florence Burton. It is not for me to defend him or to accuse him. Why do you come to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crewe; [...] "it doesn't cost {{anything to}} look at flowers, that's what they're for. Cost something to put 'em in. I got that little feller Ridley to lay 'em out--I believe I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He's</b> just beginning. Hello, Alice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More fool, Lawrence!" [...] {{retorted}} Miss Howard. [...] "Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily--as I always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bill's brows lowered savagely as he muttered, [...] "Ay, he said {{truth when}} he <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a sandal-wood trader, but he lied when--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mean! I {{could have}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> wasn't hurt, five minutes ago. Give me the light, friend; ride forward at a gentler pace; and good night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If they <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so to-day, they <b>told</b> <b>you</b> wrong: <b>he</b> {{came into}} Dunmore, from Tuam, {{on the same}} car with myself, this very afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that, <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{more than}} the truth! I am a patriot. The rest my modesty compels me to disavow." ...|$|R
60|$|COMTESSE. You {{wanted to}} know whether he talks over these matter with his wife; and she has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> does not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, Fanny, what's {{the use of}} recollecting all our foolish first impressions. I always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was {{the most}} able man in the parish.' ...|$|E
60|$|DE LEVIS. Dancy <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> didn't know {{of it in}} General Canynge's presence, and mine. [To CANYNGE] You can't deny that, if {{you want}} to.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Why, Mr Moore," [...] he begins, sort of soothing; {{when the}} small brother, who's been staring at Jerry, chips in. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was cheeky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is Philippe Rehan, who {{has brought}} the news. He only knows what I have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> as <b>he</b> mounted and rode off at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{schoolmaster}} unconsciously <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> When <b>he</b> {{spoke of}} the figure that the boy saw in the churchyard he called it 'a woman in white.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I expect <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> where <b>he</b> went. It's {{possible}} that {{a study of the}} letters would give an experienced prospector a useful hint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would, Frances," [...] {{cried the}} Colonel, {{with a happy}} smile. [...] "You think that James ought to marry the girl, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> {{was in the}} scrape?" [...] demanded Jack, in a {{hurry to}} know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't do {{less than}} Mr. Dosson. As I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> waived the {{question}} of money and he was splendid. We can't be more mercenary than he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bo, {{he said a}} lot," [...] replied Helen, reflectively. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} presently. First I want to ask you--has Carmichael ever <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how <b>he's</b> helped me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Julian gasped. [...] "After what I've <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> has done? After his {{sinking of}} the Royal Mary? After his {{treatment}} of me--of us?" [...] Lord Julian protested indignantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Mother. At any rate, {{the captain}} has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> will look after you, and make things {{comfortable}} for you, {{so we need}} not care about anything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. It {{will all}} be over soon," [...] replied Mr. Dare with a heavy cough. [...] "I suppose the doctor has <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> said he would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So Bob <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> {{meant to}} break off with my Anne when he went away?' Mrs. Loveday remarked to the trumpet-major. 'I wish I had known of it before.' ...|$|E
60|$|BARBARA. Oh {{there you}} are, Mr Shirley! [Between them] This is my father: I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a Secularist, didn't I? Perhaps you'll {{be able to}} comfort one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> left England meaning {{never to}} return? Then {{you have the}} key to the whole thing. Why not? That is what I want to know. Why not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not here," [...] {{continued}} Andre-Louis, [...] "merely {{to demand}} at your hands vengeance upon Philippe de Vilmorin's murderers. I {{am here to}} tell <b>you</b> the things <b>he</b> would to-day have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> had <b>he</b> lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fred colored. [...] "You {{wished to}} have the letter, sir. I should think it very likely that Mr. Bulstrode's denial {{is as good as}} the {{authority}} which <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what <b>he</b> denies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> is a Mr. Adams of Boston, and {{a distant}} {{connection}} of the Sewells. I met him when I was visiting at Judge Sewell's in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, as I have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> never dies. It is he who causes {{others to}} die, {{as if you}} go to Pongo-land doubtless you will find out," [...] Babemba added grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, as I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> {{was not at}} {{the place}} of meeting,' De Stancy replied. And taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it intact upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>he</b> {{considers}} <b>you</b> unjust. I did, and <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so. <b>He</b> feels what {{he considers}} the disgrace {{so much that it}} seems to him perfectly natural he should be despised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I shall {{do nothing}} of the kind. If I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>he</b> said, then I should {{have to tell the}} next man all that you may say. Would that be fair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man?" [...] {{answered}} Asti. [...] "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> is no man. Do men unfold their shadows like a garment? He {{is a god}} or a ghost, {{wearing a}} beggar's shape." ...|$|R
