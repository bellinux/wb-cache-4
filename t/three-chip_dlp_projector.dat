40|$|Digital light {{processing}} (<b>DLP)</b> <b>projectors</b> {{have been}} widely utilized to project digital structured-light patterns in 3 D imaging systems. In order to obtain accurate 3 D shape data, {{it is important to}} calibrate <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> to obtain the internal parameters. The existing projector calibration methods have complicated procedures or low accuracy of the obtained parameters. This paper presents a novel method to accurately calibrate a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> by using an optical coaxial camera. The optical coaxial geometry is realized by a plate beam splitter, so the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> can be treated as a true inverse camera. A plate having discrete markers on the surface is used to calibrate the projector. The corresponding projector pixel coordinate of each marker on the plate is determined by projecting vertical and horizontal sinusoidal fringe patterns on the plate surface and calculating the absolute phase. The internal parameters of the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> are obtained by the corresponding point pair between the projector pixel coordinate and the world coordinate of discrete markers.

A plate beam splitter is used to make imaging axis of the CCD camera and projecting axis of the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> coaxial, so the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> can {{be treated as a}} true inverse camera. A plate having discrete markers on the surface will be designed and manufactured to calibrate the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> By projecting vertical and horizontal sinusoidal fringe patterns on the plate surface from the projector, the absolute phase of each marker’s center can be obtained.

The internal and external parameters of the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> are calibrated by the corresponding point pair between the projector coordinate and the world coordinate of discrete markers. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately obtains the parameters of the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> One advantage of the method is the calibrated internal and external parameters have high accuracy because of uncalibrating the camera. The other is the optical coaxes geometry gives a true inverse camera, so the calibrated parameters are more accurate than that of crossed-optical-axes, especially the principal points and the radial distortion coefficients of the projector lens...|$|R

5000|$|The {{screen door}} effect on Digital Light Processing (<b>DLP)</b> <b>projectors</b> can be mitigated by {{deliberately}} setting the projected image {{slightly out of}} focus, which blurs the boundaries of each pixel to its neighbor. This minimizes the effect by filling the black pixel perimeters with adjacent light. Some older LCD projectors have a more noticeable screen door effect than first generation <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors.</b> [...] Newer <b>DLP</b> chip designs promise closer spacing of the mirror elements which would reduce this effect; however, some space is still required along one edge of the mirror to provide a control circuit pathway.

40|$|In this work, we recover {{fast moving}} scenes by {{exploiting}} the high-speed illumination “dithering” of cheap and easily available {{digital light processing}} (<b>DLP)</b> <b>projectors.</b> We first show how to reverse-engineer the temporal dithering for off-the-shelf projectors, using a high-speed camera. DLP dithering can produce temporal patterns commonly used in active vision techniques. Since the dithering occurs {{at a very high}} framerate, such illumination-based methods can be “sped up” for fast scenes. We demonstrate this with three applications, each of which only requires a single slide to be displayed by the <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> The quality of the result is determined by the camera frame-rate available to the user.

40|$|Abstract. Spectral {{reflectance}} is {{an intrinsic}} characteristic of objects which {{is useful for}} solving a variety of computer vision problems. In this work, we present a novel system for spectral reflectance recovery with a high temporal resolution by exploiting the unique color-forming mech-anism of <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors.</b> <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> use color wheels to produce desired light. Since the color wheels consist of several color segments and rotate fast, a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> {{can be used as}} a light source with spectrally distinct illuminations. And, the appearance of a scene under the projec-tor’s irradiation can be captured by a high-speed camera. Our system is built on easily available devices and capable of taking spectral mea-surements at 100 Hz. Based on the measurements, spectral reflectance of the scene is recovered using a linear model approximation. We carefully evaluate the accuracy of our system and demonstrate its effectiveness by spectral relighting of dynamic scenes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Active vision {{techniques}} use programmable light sources, such as projectors, whose intensities can {{be controlled}} over space and time. We present a broad framework for fast active vision using Digital Light Processing (<b>DLP)</b> <b>projectors.</b> The digital micromirror array (DMD) in a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> is capable of switching mirrors “on ” and “off ” at high speeds (10 6 /s). An off-the-shelf <b>DLP</b> <b>projector,</b> however, effectively operates at much lower rates (30 - 60 Hz) by emitting smaller intensities that are integrated over time by a sensor (eye or camera) to produce the desired brightness value. Our key idea is to exploit this “temporal dithering ” of illumination, as observed by a high-speed camera. The dithering encodes each brightness value uniquely and {{may be used in}} conjunction with virtually any active vision technique. We apply our approach to five well-known problems: (a) structured light-based range finding, (b) photometric stereo, (c) illumination de-multiplexing, (d) high frequency preserving motion-blur and (e) separation of direct and global scene components, achieving significant speedups in performance. In all our methods, the projector receives a single image as input whereas the camera acquires a sequence of frames. ...|$|R
