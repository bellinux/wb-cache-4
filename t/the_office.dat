5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> {{of royal}} forester for Worcestershire {{as well as}} sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited <b>the</b> <b>office</b> from her father. The date when he acquired <b>the</b> <b>office</b> is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to re-examine how Calvin {{understood}} <b>the</b> threefold <b>office,</b> with particular attention to <b>the</b> prophetic <b>office,</b> In his Christology. The author suggests that <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> are best understood In light of Calvin's fresh Interpretations of Chalcedonlan Christology and the Insights of the Reformation. The problem of <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> is their Interrelation. Calvin understood the unity of <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> in their relational character. Relational In the person of Christ as divine and human, and relational In {{the structure of the}} Trinity. These two elements, the relationality of the person of the Mediator, premised upon the relation of the persons of the Trinity, gave <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> <b>the</b> necessary ontological structure from which Calvin could postulate a theory of redemption with a single point of view, rather than previous theories of redemption which are simply juxtaposed. This unifying centre Is the person of the Mediator in the activity of <b>the</b> <b>offices.</b> It Is from this centre that Calvin interpreted the various biblical metaphors which are extremely difficult to bring together Into a unity. The argument Is carried further as <b>the</b> prophetic <b>office</b> In Calvin Is shown to contain the required ontological structure of <b>the</b> remaining <b>offices</b> of king and priest. Calvin's Insistence on the unity of the activity of God in each of <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> explains why there is a unity within the Church, which transcend temporal distinctions. The distinctions of <b>the</b> <b>offices</b> in history allows Calvin to underscore the centrality of Christ's incarnation into a particular time In history, further grounding the work of God In history and creation...|$|R
