5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out.</b> Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E

25|$|Several {{environmental}} risk {{factors have been}} proposed to {{support the hypothesis that}} the actual frequency of autism has increased. These include certain foods, infectious disease, pesticides. There is overwhelming scientific evidence against the MMR hypothesis and no convincing evidence for the thiomersal (or Thimerosal) hypothesis, so these types of risk factors have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out.</b> Although it is unknown whether autism's frequency has increased, any such increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a high}} {{comorbidity}} {{of learning}} disorders (LDs) in children with ADHD, {{and for that reason}} the VADRS has been studied to determine if the performance item questions on the VARS can reliably predict if the child with ADHD has a comorbid LD (e.g. math, reading, spelling LDs). Results of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis show that children with ADHD can be reliably ruled out from have a comorbid LD based on the performance items on the VARS. This is clinically useful because it allows those without LDs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out</b> and therefore reduce the amount of unnecessary referrals to healthcare professionals.|$|E

500|$|An {{analysis}} of the time difference between the transmission of the ping and the aircraft's response allowed Inmarsat to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite. This resulted in two arcs—referred to as the [...] "northern corridor" [...] and [...] "southern corridor"—where the aircraft may have been located {{at the time of}} its last complete handshake at 08:11. Using an [...] "innovative technique" [...] that has [...] "never before [...] used in an investigation of this sort", the team determined it could also use the burst frequency offset to determine the aircraft's speed and position along the identified arcs. Inmarsat cross-checked its methodology to known flight data from six Boeing777 aircraft flying in various directions on the same day, and found a good match. Applying the technique to the handshake signals from Flight370 gave results that correlated strongly with the expected and actual measurements of a southern trajectory over the Indian Ocean, but poorly with a northern trajectory. Further revised calculations to account for movements of the satellite relative to the earth allowed the northern corridor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out</b> completely. This analysis was passed on to Malaysian authorities on 23March.|$|E

Sunderland lost consecutive games when Chelsea beat them 1–0 on 15 March due to a Didier Drogba goal. Andy Reid came close to putting Sunderland in front as his free kick was plucked from the top corner by Carlo Cudicini. Sunderland's first away win of the season came on 22 March when they won 1–0 at Villa Park against Aston Villa. An 83rd minute Michael Chopra scored the winning goal for Sunderland. A 2–1 win at home to West Ham United on 29 February helped Sunderland to their first consecutive wins of the season. Kenwyne Jones' first goal since late December levelled the score at 1–1 and a 95th minute Andy Reid goal won the game.|$|E

500|$|Following Martin Foster's departure, Smith {{was handed}} the Tamworth {{captaincy}} during the 2009–10 pre-season, {{which he described}} as a [...] "massive honour". His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Stevenage Borough on 8 August 2009. Smith's first goal of the season came after scoring a powerful header in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham on 25 August 2009. In October 2009, he paid tribute to the defensive partnership he had struck up with Michael Briscoe, saying: [...] "Football is about partnerships on the pitch, having trust in team-mates and good understandings and {{we seem to have}} one." [...] Smith suffered a heel injury in October 2009, while also having a hernia problem that possibly needed an operation. After having a hernia operation, he was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out</b> for a long-term period, but returned two weeks later in the following match, a 3–1 home win over Chester City on 14 November 2009. He was handed a one-match suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in a 0–0 home draw with Forest Green Rovers on 28 December 2009, meaning he missed Tamworth's match against Oxford United on 16 January 2010. His return came in a 0–0 draw away to Gainsborough in the FA Trophy second round on 19 January 2010. After receiving a yellow card in a 1–0 defeat away to Histon on 9 March 2010, he was given a two-match suspension, returning in a 2–0 away defeat by Cambridge United on 24 March. He scored from close range in the 82nd minute for Tamworth's equalising goal in his first match against York since leaving the club, which finished a 1–1 away draw on 27 March 2010. Smith made 38 appearances and scored four goals in 2009–10.|$|E

2500|$|Agathon {{complains}} {{that the previous}} speakers have {{made the mistake of}} congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself (194e). He says that love is the youngest of gods and is an enemy of old age (195b). [...] He says that the god of love shuns the very sight of senility and clings to youth. [...] Agathon says love is dainty, and likes to tiptoe through the flowers and never settles where there is no [...] "bud to bloom" [...] (196b). It would seem that none of the characters at the party, {{with the possible exception of}} Agathon himself, would be candidates for love's companionship. Socrates, probably the oldest member of the party, seems certain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out.</b> He also implies that love creates justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom. These are the cardinal virtues in ancient Greece. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautifully formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.|$|E
2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. [...] The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, adduction, internal rotation). Conditions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out</b> include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946 and 1955 the {{neurosurgeon}} Eduard Busch {{performed a}} lumbar sympathectomy on Blixen's spinal cord, but her pain returned. In 1956 {{when she was}} diagnosed with the stomach ulcer, Professor Torben Knudtzon performed surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital, but by that time, she was in her seventies, and already in poor health. Over the next several years, she continued to suffer from dehydration and a lack of nutrition, which rendered her weak and led to four additional hospitalizations at the Central Hospital in Hillerød. Very late in her treatment, she finally confessed her use of laxatives to her doctors. The source of her abdominal problems remains unknown. A 1995 report published by the Danish physician, Kaare Weismann, concluded that the cause of her chronic pain and ailment was likely heavy metal poisoning. A 2002 report by Søgaard in the Danish Medical History Journal (...) attributed her misdiagnosis to a failure to communicate on both the part of Blixen and her doctors. As she didn't tell them about her laxative misuse, and the physicians believed they were fighting syphilis, akin to the AIDS epidemic in their era, each missed the opportunity for effective treatment. Both Erik Münster and Weismann also recognized the lapse in communication, as had Blixen been treated with penicillin, which was available by the 1950s, syphilis would have been able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{thorough}} {{study of the}} theoretical consistency of recently proposed, viable, quadratic modifications of gravity that are functions of the the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, regarding the stability of their perturbations around vacuum, maximally symmetric spaces of constant curvature. We pay special attention, in particular, to the investigation of pathological instabilities associated with the occurrence of propagating spin- 0 tachyon modes, and {{with the development of}} a graviton ghost. The latter effect is associated with the known "Ricci stability" issue, well studied in $f(R) $-theories. Within quadratic modifications of gravity it is discussed for the first time. Special attention <b>is</b> paid <b>to</b> the requirement of non-negativity of the effective gravitational coupling, which warrants that the graviton is not a negative-norm state.
