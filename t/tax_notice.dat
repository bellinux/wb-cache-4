5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Russell and Helen Bryan, a married Chippewa couple {{living in a}} mobile home on Indian lands in {{northern}} Minnesota, received a property tax bill from the local county, Itasca County. [...] The Bryans had never received a property tax bill from the county before. Unwilling to pay it, they took the <b>tax</b> <b>notice</b> to local legal aid attorneys at Leech Lake Legal Services, who brought suit to challenge the tax in the state courts. The Bryans lost their case in the state district court, and they lost again on appeal in a unanimous decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court. They then sought review in the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted review, and in a sweeping and unanimous decision authored by Justice Brennan, the Supreme Court held not only that states do not have authority to tax Natives on their reservations, but that they also lack the authority to regulate Native activities on their reservations. [...] As Gaming Law Professor Kevin K. Washburn has explained, the stage was now set for Native gaming. Within a few years, enterprising Natives and tribes began to operate Indian bingo operations in numerous different locations around the United States.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>notice</b> was not {{submitted}} anymore through {{manual system}} {{but now it}} involved electronic system, called as electronic filling system (e-filling). E-filling was a service involving the dispatch, the submission, and the reporting of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> (SPT) in electronic ways for Private and Institution. Problem of research was how the effectiveness rate of e-filling was for the submission of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> at Tax Service Office of Pratama Batu. The objectives of research were to understand tax reporting process using e-filling and to acknowledge how much the effectiveness rate of the submission of <b>tax</b> <b>notice</b> using e-filling system at Tax Service Office of Pratama Batu. Data collection techniques were observation and documentation. Result indicated that the effectiveness rate of e-filling by the submitter of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> in 2013 was 364 %, and in 2014, the submitter of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> through e-filling was 131 %. The percentage was reduced because KPP Pratama Batu had set bigger tax target for 2014 than for 2013. Indeed, {{the percentage of the}} Submission of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> using e-filling system was very effective because the percentage had exceeded 100 %. Considering this result, it was concluded that the submission of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> (SPT) using e-filling at KPP Pratama Batu was already effective, and the reporting process was determined by General Directorate of Tax. It was then suggested that KPP Pratama Batu should do the socialization quite often to the remote area such that the communities in this area could acknowledge more the submission of Annual <b>Tax</b> <b>Notice</b> (SPT) using e-filling without going far away to KPP Pratama Batu. It was important step to develop greater tax reporting rate in the next futures...|$|E

We concentrate on the decision to move in order to avoid paying the bill, and derive the optimal number of times an individual should move equalising marginal costs and benefits of the decision. We then carry out an empirical analysis based on real data provided by an Italian collection agency for the period 2004 - 2007.

5000|$|Most jurisdictions in the United States {{require that}} any {{business}} entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate {{and maintain a}} [...] "registered agent". This person may {{be known as the}} [...] "resident agent" [...] or [...] "statutory agent", depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a registered agent is to provide a legal address (not a P.O. Box) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate legal service of process being served {{in the event of a}} legal action or lawsuit. Generally, the registered agent is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as franchise <b>tax</b> <b>notices</b> and annual report forms. It is the registered agent's job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself. Registered agents generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in [...] "good standing" [...] or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a registered agent is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states.|$|R

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the foregoing, there are {{limitations}} to the protection of most recording laws. Persons who don't pay valuable consideration for their interest in the property are not protected against unrecorded interests. Examples are persons getting the property as a gift and heirs. Neither are persons who purchase ownership interests in the owners of the property, e.g., shares of stock in a corporation owning the land, because they haven't purchased an interest in the property itself. Also, the recording laws generally do not protect purchasers against real estate <b>taxes</b> because <b>notice</b> of them is usually not required to be recorded for them to be effective. Finally, certain classes of nongovernmental liens such as mechanic's liens are often made effective for a certain period of time even though unrecorded. This list is not exhaustive.|$|R
