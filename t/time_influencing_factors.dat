Between years 2009 and 2011, the project of the European Economic Area (EEA) - project No. SK 0081 - “Development of cement composites from electric and electronic plastic waste for application in building industry” - was solved in ICA SAS [3]. The obtained results contained the designs of cement composites with content of a plastic aggregate (CPA) for insulating and structural applications. Also some consecutive technological problems were solved and typical mechanical and physical properties of the mixtures were determined. At the mechanical properties measurement, a <b>time</b> <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> was taken into account and the experimental program verified also a bond strength of a dominant material with a classic reinforcement. The obtained results formed input data for a design of modest structural elements - floor panels of the sandwich type and panels where a composite only with content of PA prevailed. In the contribution, we will deal mainly with a <b>time</b> <b>factor</b> <b>influence</b> on strains and deflections of CPA elements. At the long-term tests also an influence of an environment (laboratory and outdoor protected environment) on the monitored deformation characteristics of tested elements is examined. Nowadays, the frost resistance tests of the dominant structural mixture are performed...|$|R

40|$|Keeping {{track of}} time is a {{fundamental}} challenge the brain needs to accomplish to successfully interact with the environment. However, perceived time is not equivalent to physical <b>time.</b> Disentangling <b>influencing</b> <b>factors</b> and quantifying resulting distortions of time and duration perception gives important insights into underlying computational and neural mechanisms. This thesis focuses on the modulation of short interval duration estimates by the internal temporal structure of the interval. Chapter 1 introduces contemporary models, research paradigms and findings, and outlines distortions due to temporal structure as a promising research direction. The experiments described in Chapter 2, 3 and 4 use psychophysics to systematically investigate {{the influence of the}} temporal arrangement of interval fillers. It is shown that temporal regularity and predictability lead to a robust overestimation of duration. This may be explained via a logarithmic accumulation of perceived over physical time or increased neural response magnitudes toward regular stimulation due to neural entrainment. Chapter 5 reports an experiment using electroencephalography (EEG) which gives evidence for a neural response magnitude account by showing a direct relationship between the overestimation of regularity and entrainment strength.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{the past}} decade, use of {{leukocyte}} platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) has gained tremendous momentum in regenerative dentistry as a low-cost fibrin matrix used for tissue regeneration. This study characterizes how centrifugation speed (G-force) along with centrifugation <b>time</b> <b>influence</b> growth <b>factor</b> release from fibrin clots, {{as well as}} the cellular activity of gingival fibroblasts exposed to each PRF matrix. METHODS: Standard L-PRF served as a control (2, 700 revolutions per minute [rpm]- 12 minutes). Two test groups using low-speed (1, 300 rpm- 14 minutes, termed advanced PRF [A-PRF]) and low-speed + time (1, 300 rpm- 8 minutes; A-PRF+) were investigated. Each PRF matrix was tested for growth factor release up to 10 days (eight donor samples) as well as biocompatibility and cellular activity. RESULTS: The low-speed concept (A-PRF, A-PRF+) demonstrated a significant increase in growth factor release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor, with A-PRF+ being highest of all groups. Although all PRF formulations were extremely biocompatible due to their autogenous sources, both A-PRF and A-PRF+ demonstrated significantly higher levels of human fibroblast migration and proliferation compared with L-PRF. Furthermore, gingival fibroblasts cultured with A-PRF+ demonstrated significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of PDGF, TGF-β, and collagen 1 at either 3 or 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present study demonstrate modifications to centrifugation speed and time with the low-speed concept favor an increase in growth factor release from PRF clots. This, in turn, may directly influence tissue regeneration by increasing fibroblast migration, proliferation, and collagen mRNA levels. Future animal and clinical studies are now necessary.
