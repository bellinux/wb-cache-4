5|$|All drivers made pit {{stops by}} the end of lap nine. The race order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Alesi, Button, Villeneuve, Barrichello, Frentzen, Coulthard, Diniz, Herbert, Irvine, Zonta, Salo, Gené, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Heidfeld, Wurz and Mazzacane. During that lap Barrichello overtook Frentzen for seventh, whilst Verstappen and Fisichella {{collided}} after Verstappen tried to pass the slowing Benetton at the Bus Stop chicane. Verstappen had front-wing damage, and Fisichella later retired with an electrical problem. By the beginning of lap 13, Michael Schumacher closed his gap from Häkkinen to about 4.6 seconds after four consecutive fastest laps. Later in the lap, Häkkinen <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> kerb at Stavelot corner and was sent spinning sideways into the grass; Michael Schumacher took the lead. Nick Heidfeld was the race's third retirement when his car developed a mechanical problem during that lap.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the {{installation}} {{and stated that}} the Soviet Union would build a counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1902 the {{air chamber}} of another torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and {{wounding}} three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte. Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to}} the Northern Squadron in 1904 and arrived at Brest on 25 March. She was lightly damaged when she <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later, in October 1913, Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to the}} Training Division of which she became the flagship in April 1914.|$|E

5|$|Rivalries were renewed in 1999–2000 {{following}} Manchester City's promotion back to {{the second}} tier. Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road {{for the first time}} in history (1999–2000) thanks to goals from former City youngster Alan Bailey and County legend Tony Dinning. Manchester City were famously defeated once more by Stockport County in 2001–02, when 2 late goals from John Hardiker handed bottom of the table Stockport victory, and in the process City were prevented from gaining 100 points in their quest for the Division One title. Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002, with Stockport County winning three times, losing once and drawing twice. The defeats suffered at the hands of County clearly <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> raw nerve with many Manchester City supporters, some of whom have celebrated County's downfall on the 'bluemoon' forum. The rivalry with City is made all the more complex by the fact that Stockport is a hotbed for Manchester City support.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprints {{collected}} at a crime scene, or on items of evidence from a crime, {{have been used}} in forensic science to identify suspects, victims and other persons who <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> surface. Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository. In modern times, researchers can find traces of addictive drugs on just a fingerprint.|$|E

25|$|Following this, {{the process}} towards beatification began, and {{investigations}} by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (S.C.R.) into miracles performed by intercessory work of Pius X took place. The S.C.R. would eventually recognize two miracles. The first involved Sr. Marie-Françoise Deperras, a nun who had bone cancer and was cured on 7 December 1928 during a novena {{in which a}} relic of Pius X was placed on her chest. The second involved Sr. Benedetta De Maria, who had cancer, and in a novena started in 1938, she eventually <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> relic statue of Pius X and was cured.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts of}} the male members of the Tagore family {{in the field of}} music, theatre and writing must have {{penetrated}} into the inner precincts of the Jorasanko Thakur Bari and <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> chord in Swarnakumari. When Jyotirindranath Tagore was involved with his experiments in music, plays and writing, he was assisted by Akshay Chandra Chaudhuri and Rabindranath. In his Jyotirindrasmriti (Reminiscence) he wrote, “With Janaki going to England and arrival of my younger sister Swarnakumari in our house, we got another partner in our literary ventures.” While Gyanadanandini Devi took the lead for breaking down age-old restrictions on women in the house, Swarnakumari flourished in creativity.|$|E
25|$|Following a leaked TMZ {{video from}} during the incident, a July 17, 2017 press release {{revealed}} Reinhart's friend, Alan Chislof, had been restrained, choked, and beaten by several men working as bouncers for Lamplighter Inn. He sustained a concussion, a cut above {{his left eye}} requiring stitches, and broken blood vessels in his eyes due to the incident. Chislof also revealed that the group had not flipped over a table as claimed by the bouncers; instead, Reinhart had <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> rope separating the table area and the dancefloor, which angered the guards and caused them to escort her out aggressively. Reinhart's attorney denies that Reinhart struck anyone during the incident.|$|E

25|$|Two migrant field {{workers in}} California on their {{plantation}} during the Great Depression—George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a bulky, strong man but mentally disabled—are in Soledad {{on their way}} to another part of California. They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet rabbits on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from Weed after Lennie <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> young woman's dress and wouldn't let go, leading to an accusation of rape. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.|$|E
25|$|During that year, Toni {{was still}} {{active in the}} party, writing for Lumea Nouă and {{upholding}} Gherea's political line. His articles <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> sensitive subject: the Law on Mining, passed by the Junimist Prime Minister Petre P. Carp, which did away with the PNL's protectionism and greatly increased foreign investment in the Romanian economy. The PSDMR, committed to the Marxist theory on the relations of production, supported the law as a step forward into capitalism, but also criticized it for not allowing a state monopoly on mines. Also that year, Bacalbașa dueled with a certain Bogdanovici, having Caragiale as his witness. The event is remembered in literature because Caragiale, using his trademark black humor, called on the duelers to fire their pistols {{from a distance of}} ten paces.|$|E
25|$|By {{this point}} Haile Melekot was {{discouraged}} and gravely sick. His brother Seyfe, dissatisfied with his indecision, led the army south from Wollo to Menz then to Tegulet, abandoning Haile Melekot. The local governors were {{no match for}} the Emperor, and either were defeated or (like the governor of Efrata) went over to Tewodros' side. Rebellious Oromo burned Angolalla. The Negus of Shewa was horrified to learn that his mother Bezabish and his grandmother Zenebework (respectively widow and mother of the late Sahle Selassie) had crossed to the camp of Tewodros II and paid him homage in exchange for a guarantee that their personal lands would not be <b>touched.</b> <b>A</b> despondent Haile Melekot made a few skirmishes against Tewodros' forces, then destroyed his food stores and his capital of Ankober to keep it out of Tewodros' hands. He died of his illness in the town of Atakelt, and was hastily buried at Debre Gage in Tara.|$|E

Players <b>touching</b> <b>a</b> stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship. <b>Touching</b> <b>a</b> stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction (unless the stationary stone is struck in such a manner that its position is altered), and is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.|$|R
25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he <b>touched</b> <b>a</b> power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E

500|$|Awards that I Not Stupid won include Best Chinese Film at the Golden Bauhinia Awards and Best Chinese Humanitarian Film at the 2002 Taiwan Golden Torch Awards; {{the movie}} was also {{nominated}} for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards, losing to My Sassy Girl.

Jack Neo [...] a clever, well-crafted social commentary and a damn good film to boot." [...] Other reviewers described I Not Stupid as [...] "one of the greatest cinematic feats I’ve {{had the pleasure of}} experiencing" [...] and displaying a [...] "simple and yet excellent execution".
