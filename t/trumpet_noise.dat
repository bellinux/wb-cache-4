50|$|I {{loved the}} humming {{scene in the}} movie, The Hobbit. I’ve been putting {{background}} vocal humming & vocal sounds in song arrangements because of that, like in my song, Reach Me, on the CD, Tender Ramble. I’ve also made a mouth <b>trumpet</b> <b>noise</b> for many years that makes people laugh so I put that in. The mouth trumpet was also in a song of mine called, Bolstered By Blue on my Tender Ramble, CD. I come up with horn lines in the car while listening to rough tracks, too.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{player in}} the act was DJ/producer and remixer Mark Moore. In 1989, the group {{released}} its debut album, Original Soundtrack, which featured a line-up of Mark M (noise engineer), Pascal Gabriel (noise engineer), Jocasta (hi-hat hairspray, background vox), Mark D (<b>trumpet,</b> <b>noise,</b> boogie factor), and Michellé (microdot clarinet and vox). The album consisted of slightly longer versions of S-Express's [...] "Theme" [...] and its follow-up hits [...] "Superfly Guy" [...] (UK #5) featuring a very young Seal on vocals, and a cover version of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "Hey Music Lover" [...] (UK #6; its b-side was remixed by minimalist composer Philip Glass), along with an album's worth of new compositions. Singer Billie Ray Martin also appeared on several tracks on its debut.|$|E

50|$|Several days later, {{during a}} {{briefing}} before high-ranking government officials, Keenan {{reports that he}} then head-butted Cooper and took {{the rest of the}} congregation into custody. He explains that the <b>trumpet</b> <b>noises</b> were not the Rapture but came from a group of college students who lived down the road and were irritated with Cooper. As a prank they rigged up an old fire house siren to an iPod with loud <b>trumpet</b> <b>noises,</b> unaware of the shootout taking place over the hill. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors at the time to kill everyone at the compound.|$|R

50|$|His trap ("The Better Mouse Trap, Designed and Built by Tom Cat") completed, Tom hides as Jerry grabs cheese which Tom tied to string. The {{successive}} {{elements of}} the trap work together; an alarm clock, a saw, scissors, a hammer, a vertical tower, a banana, windshield wipers, a bucket of sand, a fan, a pool ball, and a washing machine. Lastly, a rifle shoots at a cuckoo clock and the cuckoo begins cutting a rope. Tom aims to capture Jerry by flattening him and storing him inside a suspended safe. Tom eagerly stands next to Jerry and ties blindfold over his eyes, {{but because of the}} altered measurement, the safe lands two feet away from Jerry and falls onto Tom instead. Jerry flees as the safe door opens and Tom walks out shaped as a cube. Angry over all the wasted energy for build the trap and being outsmarted and crushed by the safe, a defeated Tom leans on the safe and curses (blocked by <b>trumpet</b> <b>noises).</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{that time}} our men had chaffered thus {{four or five}} times they first heard, and in a little while after saw, their two great boats, with their fellows, coming down the river, at about two miles' distance, with their drums and <b>trumpets,</b> and making <b>noise</b> enough.|$|R
6000|$|But now {{within the}} halls the magic sleep [...] Was broken, and men sought them everywhere; Yet Aphrodite cast a cloud so deep [...] About their chariot none might see them there. [...] And strangely did {{they hear the}} <b>trumpets</b> blare, And <b>noise</b> of racing wheels; yet saw they nought: [...] Then died the sounds upon the distant air, And safe they won the haven that they sought.|$|R
60|$|What surely is a woman's calling but {{to teach}} man? {{and to teach}} him what? To temper his fiercer, coarser, more self-assertive nature by the contact of her gentleness, purity, self-sacrifice. To make him see that not by blare of <b>trumpets,</b> not by <b>noise,</b> wrath, greed, ambition, intrigue, puffery, is good and lasting {{work to be done}} on earth; but by wise self- distrust, by silent labour, by lofty self-control, by that charity which hopeth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things; by such an example, in short, as women now in tens of {{thousands}} set to those around them; such as they will show more and more, the more their whole womanhood is educated to employ its powers without waste and without haste in harmonious unity.|$|R

5000|$|The world {{association}} football governing body, FIFA, proposed banning vuvuzelas from stadiums, as {{they were}} seen as potential weapons for hooligans and {{could be used in}} ambush marketing. Columnist Jon Qwelane described the device as [...] "an instrument from hell". South African football authorities argued that the vuvuzela was part of the South African football experience. The Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso said, [...] "Those <b>trumpets?</b> That <b>noise</b> I don't like ... FIFA must ban those things ... it is not nice to have a noise like that". Commentator Farayi Mungazi said, [...] "Banning the vuvuzela would take away the distinctiveness of a South African World Cup ... absolutely essential for an authentic South African footballing experience". Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk remarked, [...] "... it was annoying ... in the stadiums {{you get used to it}} but it is still unpleasant". FIFA President Sepp Blatter responded, [...] "we should not try to Europeanise an African World Cup ... that is what African and South Africa football is all about - noise, excitement, dancing, shouting and enjoyment". Despite the criticisms, FIFA agreed to permit their use in stadiums during the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup. The South African football authority argued that during FIFA World Cup 2010, vuvuzelas achieved great popularity, though TV spectators suffered a lot due to vuvuzela noise pollution.|$|R
6000|$|Surely that is woman's calling--{{to teach}} man: {{and to teach}} him what?

500|$|On {{the early}} morning of October 13, Báthory {{appeared}} on the [...] "heights beyond the brook." [...] Ali was forced to stand ground {{in order to secure}} an eventual redrawl and evacuate his booty." [...] Báthory ordered his army to prepare for battle: his 3,000 Transylvanian Saxons, supported by a second line of Transylvanian Wallachians, comprised the right flank on the Mureş River, while the Hungarians comprised the left flank—he and his heavy cavalry were placed in the middle. The Ottoman leaders were in disagreement and had their preparations for the battle delayed; after [...] "three hours of idle waiting, Báthory, confident that Pál Kinizsi would arrive any minute, gave the order to attack." [...] The Transylvanian Saxons opened the attack, but were routed; the Transylvanian Wallachians followed their fate, with many being wounded or killed; and later, the Hungarian line would be pressured to retreat to the centre. Báthory then charged with his heavy cavalry, but fell off his horse; this alerted his companions who interpreted it as a bad omen and advised him to either turn back or retreat to the mountains. He ignored their advice and as head of his cavalry, charged the first Ottoman line with a great force, [...] routing them. Ali then charged with his cavalry and a fierce battle took place that lasted for three hours. Báthory was seriously injured, as he bled from six wounds; [...] "his horse had been killed under him." [...] Surrounded by a [...] "wall of corpses" [...] and barely holding onto his life, he was about to lose the battle when Kinizsi's army appeared on the hill, with drums and <b>trumpets</b> making their <b>noise.</b> Some 900 Serbs under a Demeter Jakšić assisted by [...] "numerous courtiers of the king", charged against the Turks. The Turks, who were taken by surprise, were slaughtered by the furious Kinizsi and after a renewed attack, he managed to save Báthory.|$|R
60|$|On {{the right}} of the Campbells, the Knight of Ardenvohr {{obtained}} some advantage, through his military skill and by strength of numbers. He had moved forward obliquely the extreme flank of his line at the instant the Royalists were about to close, so that they sustained a fire at once on front and in flank, and, despite the utmost efforts of their leader, were thrown into some confusion. At this instant, Sir Duncan Campbell gave the word to charge, and thus unexpectedly made the attack at the very moment he seemed about to receive it. Such a change of circumstances is always discouraging, and often fatal. But the disorder was remedied by the advance of the Irish reserve, whose heavy and sustained fire compelled the Knight of Ardenvohr to forego his advantage, and content himself with repulsing the enemy. The Marquis of Montrose, in the meanwhile, availing himself of some scattered birch trees, {{as well as of the}} smoke produced by the close fire of the Irish musketry, which concealed the operation, called upon Dalgetty to follow him with the horse, and wheeling round so as to gain the right flank and even the rear of the enemy, he commanded his six trumpets to sound the charge. The clang of the cavalry <b>trumpets,</b> and the <b>noise</b> of the galloping of the horse, produced an effect upon Argyle's right wing which no other sounds could have impressed them with. The mountaineers of that period had a superstitious dread of the war-horse, like that entertained by the Peruvians, and had many strange ideas respecting the manner in which that animal was trained to combat. When, therefore, they found their ranks unexpectedly broken, and that the objects of their greatest terror were suddenly in the midst of them, the panic, in spite of Sir Duncan's attempts to stop it, became universal. Indeed, the figure of Major Dalgetty alone, sheathed in impenetrable armour, and making his horse caracole and bound, so as to give weight to every blow which he struck, would have been a novelty in itself sufficient to terrify those who had never seen anything more nearly resembling such a cavalier, than a SHELTY waddling under a Highlander far bigger than itself. The repulsed Royalists returned to the charge; the Irish, keeping their ranks, maintained a fire equally close and destructive. There was no sustaining the fight longer. Argyle's followers began to break and fly, most towards the lake, the remainder in different directions. The defeat of the right wing, of itself decisive, was rendered irreparable by the death of Auchenbreck, who fell while endeavouring to restore order.|$|R
