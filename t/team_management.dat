5|$|In 2008, the MLS {{expansion}} franchise Sounders FC {{decided to}} develop the Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila, and the USL team played {{most of the season}} at that facility. At the time, <b>team</b> <b>management</b> thought that practicing and playing at Starfire could provide a better transition for those hoping to play for the new MLS team. The last match for the USL Sounders at Qwest Field was the 2008 season opener against the rival Portland Timbers. The game ended in a scoreless draw in front of 10,184.|$|E

With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with <b>team</b> <b>management,</b> and asked, if {{he was to be}} fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of the}} season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E

5|$|A {{modicum of}} peace was {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and <b>team</b> <b>management</b> relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E
5|$|An {{anthropomorphic}} cougar named Ozzie was the team's mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie {{came from}} the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team, which had an extra mascot costume. The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, <b>team</b> <b>management</b> decided to make him the permanent mascot. The original Ozzie costume was brown, but a new yellow costume was introduced in 1998. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied <b>team</b> <b>management</b> to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E

He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had {{inherited}} and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, {{who had been with}} the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, and said he would never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the <b>team</b> <b>management</b> would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, the NHL officially {{stated that}} the trophy {{was to go to}} the team that allowed the fewest number of goals during the regular season.

5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010.

Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The fifteenth stage saw {{the race}} enter the Dolomites and {{traverse}} three major climbs within the mountain chain. On the descent of the Monte Rest, Roche formed a leading group {{with two other}} riders after speeding away from the race leader's group. Despite orders from his <b>team</b> <b>management,</b> Roche continued with the move. The Carrera Jeans-Vagabond pack chased after the Roche group to protect the advantage of Roche's teammate and race leader Visentini. Roche crossed the finish line in twelfth place, fifty-six seconds after the stage winner van der Velde, which allowed him to don again the pink jersey by five seconds over Tony Rominger. Roche's actions, taking the race lead away from Visentini and disobeying team commands, gained him the hatred of the Italian cyclings fans.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sporting}} {{event at the}} stadium was a double-header on July 28, 2002, that included both the Sounders Select Women and the men's Seattle Sounders of the USL team. The women defeated the Vancouver Breakers 4–3, while the men beat the Vancouver Whitecaps 4–1 in front of 25,515 people. The USL team began using the facility regularly as their home field in 2003. Although <b>team</b> <b>management</b> was concerned with the high rent and the underused seating capacity, they were drawn by the sponsorship opportunities and location. The Sounders increased their average attendance from 2,583 at Seattle's Memorial Stadium in 2002 to 3,452 at the new stadium in 2003. In 2005, the Sounders beat the Richmond Kickers 2–1 in a penalty shootout for the USL championship in front of 8,011.

5|$|In {{the early}} days, <b>team</b> <b>management</b> was {{undertaken}} by a club committee. When payment of players was legalised in 1885, Alfred Jones began {{to act as}} club secretary on a voluntary basis. Small Heath's election to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League in 1892 prompted {{the board of directors}} to appoint him as the club's first paid official, responsible as secretary-manager for matters on the field in addition to his administrative duties. In his first season the club won the inaugural Second Division championship, and gained promotion to the First Division {{for the first time the}} following year via the Test Match system. Jones's 16-year tenure saw three promotions and three relegations, after the last of which in 1908 he resigned. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with the club having to apply for re-election to the league and with responsibility for team affairs passing to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first dedicated team manager.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent back down to the OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra had dressed for only four games in the two months between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft.

Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied <b>team</b> <b>management</b> to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E

5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. <b>Team</b> <b>management</b> refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson {{made his}} NHL debut on February 1, 2011, in a 4–1 win against the Dallas Stars. Centring the fourth line and {{playing on the}} second powerplay unit, he {{registered}} two shots in over nine minutes of ice time. The following day, he scored his first career NHL goal against Ilya Bryzgalov in a 6–0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. In his third game, he recorded his first career NHL assist on a goal by Christian Ehrhoff against the Chicago Blackhawks; Vancouver won 4–3. After appearing in his first five NHL games, Hodgson was returned to the Moose on February 11. <b>Team</b> <b>management</b> explained to the media his call-up was a means to introduce him to NHL play {{and that they were}} more comfortable having him continue developing in the AHL with first-line minutes and a bigger role with the Moose. However, with the team's fourth-line centre role unfilled (Alain Vigneault had been using natural winger Tanner Glass in that position), he was called back to Vancouver within ten days. Hodgson played three more games for the Canucks before the team acquired fourth-line centre Maxim Lapierre from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline on February 28. Hodgson was subsequently sent back down to Manitoba. He completed his professional rookie season with 30 points in 52 AHL games – ranking fifth in Moose scoring – and two points in eight NHL games.|$|E
