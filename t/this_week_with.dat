500|$|The {{episode was}} almost universally praised by critics. [...] Abby West of Entertainment Weekly complimented {{the writing of}} B.J.

[...] IGN's Brian Zoromski rated it 10 out of 10, making it only one of two third-season episodes he deemed a [...] "masterpiece". He stated that [...] "Another truly brilliant episode of The Office aired <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> more humor packed into the half-hour than you get in many feature-length comedies." [...] Zoromski also praised the acting by minor characters, such as Creed Bratton and Mindy Kaling, who portrays customer service representative Kelly Kapoor.|$|E

[...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave it an 8.4 out of 10 rating and noted that Flight of the Conchords is at its best when [...] "the antics remain tightly between , and this episode sticks with that," [...] noting that the episode [...] "winds up being rather great." [...] Noted television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Taken on its own, though, this [...] was perfection, as both comedy and as musical."

500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> David Brinkley television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E
500|$|Thompson officially {{entered the}} race on April 1, 2007 {{following}} {{the announcement that}} he would seek the Republican Party's nomination for president during an interview on <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> George Stephanopoulos. He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was [...] "looking good" [...] due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa. The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq, holding that as president, he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or not the United States military should remain in the nation. He stated that if the Iraqis [...] "don't want us there...we should get out." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V.

Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.4/10 {{saying it was}} [...] "Impressive" [...] and [...] "With or without the timeliness {{of the story and}} setting, 'Boy Meets Curl' was a fast and funny episode certain to be a highlight of the season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had some pretty good episodes overall. I wouldn't put this on The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer has got a bit of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{believed}} the episode was [...] "well-schooled" [...] in the horror genre, [...] "with plenty of freaking out and jumping at shadows. Arnold and Price's elegant music {{came to the}} fore wonderfully in the largely wordless scenes of Watson and Henry's fearful hallucinations." [...] Mellor was also appreciative of McGuigan's [...] "stylish hand" [...] as director, particularly highlighting the [...] "mind palace" [...] sequence, as well as Tovey's performance as Henry Knight and for [...] "once again" [...] seeing Watson's role for being [...] "more than just sigh exasperatedly at his flatmate and apologise to others on Sherlock's behalf." [...] In summary, the reviewer stated [...] "I can only echo Sherlock's own closing words to Henry: [...] "This case, thank you, it's been brilliant"." [...] Chris Tilly of IGN rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10, but stated that although the it was [...] "full of mystery and intrigue," [...] the central story [...] "wasn't strong enough to fill the 90-minute run-time, running out of steam at the mid-way point and padded out with irrelevant and at times exasperating efforts to throw the audience off the scent." [...] Tilly praised Cumberbatch's performance as a mentally broke down Holmes, and Freeman for being [...] "let off the leash <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> Watson investigating solo on a couple of occasions," [...] and also thought Tovey was a [...] "fine addition to the ensemble." ...|$|E
