He knew that in conversations people do often {{interrupt}} one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact. And then, some years later, Marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.|$|E

[...] Chess responded, [...] "if Muddy likes it, give it to him". [...] At the time, Waters was performing at the Club Zanzibar in Chicago. [...] During an intermission, Dixon showed him the song.

Peter Weiniger from The Age was prepared to give the series a chance based on the episode, saying [...] "Like most American sitcoms, The Drew Carey Show {{has its share of}} snappy one-liners but it gives the impression of trying a little too hard. To be fair, this is the first of a series, and we have yet to see the characters develop. Even Seinfeld <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time to become essential viewing." ...|$|E

500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after {{that we were going}} to get back to our roots. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of time to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States.

I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into. I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story. I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stage 18 was {{extremely}} important to the race's overall standings. With [...] still {{to go before the}} finish, Andy Schleck attacked out of the group of race favorites, and no one followed him. He made the bridge up to a teammate from the morning escape, who paced him to a maximum four-minute advantage {{at the front of the}} race. From behind, Evans put in an intensive effort from about the [...] to go mark to limit his losses. Schleck easily won the stage, but Evans remained only 57 seconds down, a time gap he could easily make up in the stage 20 individual time trial. Evans had mounted the final chase all on his own, with riders near him such as Voeckler and Ivan Basso contributing no work. Fränk Schleck <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time out of him in view of the finish line, but no one else did, as the field finished scattered behind Evans. His long, largely solo chase was characterized as saving his overall chances after Andy Schleck had made his bid for Tour victory beforehand. The status quo largely held the next day on Alpe d'Huez, though Voeckler at last fell from the race lead, putting Andy Schleck in the yellow jersey. Schleck was characterized as missing an important chance to pad his race lead with the time trial, where Evans was recognized as the better of the two, still to race.|$|E

[...] They were joined by citizens of Torreón and began the sacking of the business district. [...] The mob released prisoners from jail, looted stores, and attacked people on the street.

[...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification."

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
