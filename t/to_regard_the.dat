5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s.

5|$|Following a {{visit by}} Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, {{established}} in Toamasina in 1818 {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a network of public schools where numeracy and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the Malagasy language Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting pupils to Christianity. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> few Malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade Malagasy people from being baptized or attending Christian services.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an {{adaptation}} of William Shakespeare's Macbeth—set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, Isuzu Yamada, <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> work {{as if it were}} a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.|$|E
5|$|During the uprising, the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted white and red, the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary blue, white and red as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, British {{paleontologist}} Guy Pilgrim described {{two species}} from the Miocene {{of what is}} now India and Pakistan, Sivanasua palaeindica from Chinji (Pakistan) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar (India). He attributed both to Sivanasua, a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe. The next year, American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new genus and species Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar, which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae. The generic name, Indraloris, combines the name of the god Indra with the generic name Loris, and the specific name, lulli, honors Richard Swann Lull, at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim's Sivanasua species had been misidentified; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli, but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open. Tattersall, who also described additional material of Indraloris, continued <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> animal as a lorisid.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused {{on trying to}} create a stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately leading to a fresh revolt. Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was able to deal with the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
5|$|The vacancy {{may also}} have {{occurred}} because Wilfrid, who {{was at that point}} having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon, says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. Æthelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon. Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported by all of the kings and bishops. After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I, who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post-Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute. Historians have since come <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> two letters as genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority.|$|E
25|$|In general, it is {{becoming}} less valid <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also Transport in the Faroe Islands) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>regard</b> <b>the</b> Faroes as a dispersed city or even to {{refer to it as}} the Faroese Network City.|$|E
