40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a toll pricing {{framework for}} a traffic network in a dynamic setting. The model {{is based on}} a discrete-time dynamic traffic assignment problem, where the travel time is a function of density. We construct a set of time-varying toll vectors such that a solution (or an approximate solution) of the system problem is a solution of <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>tolled</b> user equilibrium problem. In general, a valid time-varying toll vector is not unique and the set of valid toll vectors can be expressed algebraically. Then, a desired time-varying toll vector can be chosen to optimize a secondary objective. Illustrative numerical results from a small network are provided. Key words: congestion toll pricing, time-varying tolls, dynamic traffic assignment. ...|$|R

Only in the last decades, the epidemic of PM began to show its gravity. Traditional studies (APC analysis and Environmental studies) focused on measuring the risk mostly for particular categories of people, and on deducing <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> death <b>toll</b> by applying the relative risks to plausible future population scenarios.

40|$|Obstructions {{caused by}} {{accidents}} can trigger or exacerbate traffic congestion. This paper derives the efficient traffic pattern for a rush hour with congestion and acci-dents and <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> road <b>toll.</b> Compared {{to the model}} without accidents, where the toll equals external costs imposed on drivers using the road at the same time, a new insight arises: An optimal toll also internalizes the expected increase in future congestion costs. Since accidents affect more drivers if traffic volumes are rising than when they are declining, the efficient charge depends upon the demand for road use {{during the rest of}} the peak period...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies of the morning commute problem in a network with a single route or parallel routes with a single bottleneck on each route. Most congested networks, however, often contain more than one congestion spot along each route. In such networks, it is usually difficult to derive analytically their system-optimal traffic patterns and the tolls that realize them. In this paper, we study the morning commute problem in such a network with certain special topological features - a freeway with multiple entry/exit ramps and a surface street grid with large capacities. For this type of networks, we investigated the basic characteristics of their optimal dynamic traffic patterns and <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>tolling</b> scheme, for which a graphical solution procedure was also developed. In this network, we found that at system-optimum: (1) the aggregate traffic flow on the freeway has a staircase temporal profile, and piecewise linear dynamic tolls can be imposed on a subset of ramps to achieve it; (2) among all the off-ramps in use, the ones closer to the destination are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges than the ones {{farther away from the}} destination; and (3) among all the on-ramps in use, the ones with larger cumulative volume-to-capacity ratios are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges. Some practical implications of these findings to corridor traffic management were also discussed. Morning commute System-optimum Dynamic congestion pricing Corridor control...|$|R
40|$|Let V be a nonsingular cubic surface defined over Q, let U be {{the open}} subset of V {{obtained}} by deleting the 27 lines, and denote by N(U, H) {{the number of}} rational points in U of height less than H. Manin has conjectured that if V(Q) is not empty then (1) N(U, H) = C 1 H(log H) (r- 1) (1 + o(1)) for some C- 1 > 0, where r is the rank of NS(V/Q), the Neron-Severi group of V over Q. In this note we consider the special case when V contains two rational skew lines; and we prove that for some C- 2 > 0 and all large enough H, N(U, H) > C 2 H(log H) (r- 1) This is <b>the</b> one-sided estimate <b>corresponding</b> <b>toll).</b> It seems probable that the arguments in this paper could be modified to prove <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> result when V contains two skew lines conjugate over Q and each defined over a quadratic extension of Q {{but we have not}} attempted to write out the details...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{here two}} essential technologies of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) : Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V 2 I) communication. In Chapter II, {{we present a}} method to automatically control a platoon of vehicles equipped with V 2 V devices. One of the major issues with platoon control is latency in wireless communications. Latency has {{a negative impact on}} safety and disrupts the stability of platoons. We propose a decentralized longitudinal platoon-controlling mechanism that uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to ensure vehicles safety, even in high-latency communications environments. The sensitivity of this method is analyzed to derive the conditions {{for the safety of the}} vehicles in the platoon. A simulation test bed for this control method is implemented to test its effectiveness and safety under two communications latency settings. The results show that the model predictive control method can safely control the platoon even in high-latency communications environments. In Chapter III, we propose a combinatorial auction implemented via a V 2 I system to toll and allocate traffic to eliminate congestion on a sub-network of links. We design a Vickrey-Clarke-Groove (VCG) type auction mechanism, which enables vehicles to bid for paths through V 2 I devices before entering the network. Using the individual vehicle bids, an optimization problem is formulated and solved, to generate the assignment of vehicles to paths and <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>tolls.</b> <b>The</b> underlying model is analyzed for its special properties. We prove that this auction mechanism guarantees truthful reporting and maximizes the social utility. We then test this auction mechanism in two numerical experiments: first with a network of 6 links and 5100 vehicles, and then in a network with 98 links and 12000 vehicles. We prove that in a multiple origin-destination network, it is necessary to add an additional free path for each origin destination pair, in order to guarantee that the toll is always no greater than the bid made by the vehicle. We also discuss various implementation issues of this model, including use of a rolling horizon for multiple-round auctions, and the potential of this auction system as a toll setting mechanism for High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or (High-Occupancy Tolled) HOT lanes...|$|R

40|$|Interoperability is a {{political}} priority as it comes to electronic tolling in Europe. The idea of numerous on board units behind the windscreen of European trucks is a true politicians nightmare. Still the number of on-board equipment (OBE) is increasing while the answer to stopping this, the European Electronic Tolling Service (EETS), is not taking off. In this paper the specific complexity of EETS and the interoperability Directive are looked at {{from the perspective of}} a public toll charger. This perspective is relevant because in many Member States motorways are publicly owned and operated, and road user charges consequently will be public money, often levied as a tax. These circumstances do not seem to match very well with the starting points of the Directive that more or less seems to presuppose private roads were private service providers can collect private service fees for the private <b>toll</b> <b>chargers.</b> In this paper the political and legal problems will be represented and put out for discussion...|$|R

In the Imperial and Mexicali valleys, both Interstate 8 and Federal Highway 2 are connected by State Route 111 and from this junction lead to the coastal center at San Diego-Tijuana.
