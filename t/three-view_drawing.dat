40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to understanding engineering drawings, which is the problem to recover the 3 D data of the legal solid objects from the 2 D data of a given <b>three-view</b> orthographic <b>drawing.</b> Our method essentially consists of two major processes: translation of the original 2 D data to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) by using a constraint knowledge base, and solving the CSP to get the final 3 D data by using a general CSP solver. To realize the translation process, we develop geometrical rules derived from the restoration knowledge based on the axiom of existence of 3 D objects in the usual Euclidean space. Since a CSP, an intermediate expression of an original drawing, is actually a knowledge base independent from both the given 2 D data and the final 3 D data, our approach enables us (1) to tune up the knowledge base easily, (2) to customize the restoration system with high modularity, and (3) to make use of existing general purpose constraint solvers adopting many kinds of efficient search techniques as well...|$|R
40|$|An {{intelligent}} robot that recognizes and assembles three-dimensional objects is described. The instruction to the robot is fed through a vidicon camera as a three-view {{plan of the}} assemblage whose overall spatial configuration is then recognized and decomposed into component parts by a computer. Another camera looks at the real world for the specific parts required for the assembly and confirms their geometric features. The computer further makes the decisions on the procedure for the manipulation of the parts, and orders the articulated mechanical hand to proceed the assembly sequence. The information processing is so far restricted to simple polyhedral objects and their co-relationships.

The aircraft has a Plexiglas canopy. The original PA-8's engine was specified, a Lycoming O-145 of [...]|$|E
40|$|A {{ditching}} {{investigation of}} {{a model of the}} Convair-Liner airplane was made to observe the behavior and determine the safest procedure for making an emergency water landing. The ditching model was designed and constructed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Design information on the airplane was furnished by the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation. A <b>three-view</b> <b>drawing</b> of the airplane is shown. The investigation was made in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail...|$|E
40|$|A {{compilation}} of free-spinning-airplane model {{data on the}} spin and recovery characteristics of 111 airplanes is presented. These data were previously published in separate memorandum reports and were obtained from free-spinning tests in the Langley 15 -foot and the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnels. The model test data presented include the steady-spin and recovery characteristics of each model for various combinations of aileron and elevator deflections and for various loadings and dimensional configurations. Dimensional data, mass data, and a <b>three-view</b> <b>drawing</b> of the corresponding free-spinning tunnel model are also presented for each airplane. The data presented should be of value to designers and should facilitate the design of airplanes incorporating satisfactory spin-recovery characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{generation}} method is proposed in this paper to acquire range images for complicated polyhedron in 3 D space {{from a series of}} view angles. In the proposed generation method, concept of <b>three-view</b> <b>drawing</b> in mechanical cartography is introduced into the range image generation procedure. Negative and positive directions of x-, y-, and z-axes are selected as the view angles to generate the range images for complicated polyhedron in 3 D space. Furthermore, a novel iterative operation of mathematical morphology is proposed to ensure that satisfactory range images can be generated for the polyhedron from all the selected view angles. Compared with the existing method based on single view angle and interpolation operation, structure features contained in surface of the complicated polyhedron can be represented more consistently with the reality by using the proposed multi-view-angle range images generation method. The proposed generation method is validated by using an experiment...|$|E
40|$|The Screem-J 4 D is a {{remotely}} piloted {{airplane that}} was designed to fly at a chord Reynold's number of 100, 000 while performing figure- 8 maneuvers in a restricted area. It has a high aspect ratio main wing with a conventional empennage giving it a sailplane appearance. A specifications table and <b>three-view</b> <b>drawing</b> is provided. The flight plan calls for ascent to cruise altitude at 20 ft and then perform three figure- 8 turns around pylons. These pylons will be separated by fifty yards and stationed inside a sports facility. Once completed, the pilot is to make use of any remaining power by loitering before landing the plane. The propulsion system of the J 4 D consists of a propeller-electric motor combination with the prop mounted {{at the front of the}} fuselage. In order to provide sufficient lift for low speed travel, the J 4 D has an aspect ratio of 11. 72 with an 8. 2 inch mean chord. The wing consists of a spar and rib construction with Micafilm skin. A combination of directional and longitudinal control will enable the J 4 D to perform the figure- 8 maneuvers. However, in order to avoid the construction and servo weight of ailerons, the rudder was designed to be over one-half the size of the vertical tail to insure that the proper roll motion could be attained...|$|E
