5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. <b>The</b> <b>heroes</b> then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E
5000|$|Hero decks include (usually) one {{card that}} {{represents}} <b>the</b> <b>hero.</b> It gives <b>the</b> <b>hero's</b> initial hit points and a power they may use.

Hero decks also contain forty other cards representing ongoing abilities, equipment, and one-shots that can be played.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hero's</b> Sidekick - <b>the</b> <b>hero's</b> trusty companion. Although {{he stands}} for what's right, <b>the</b> <b>Hero's</b> Sidekick's {{interests}} are largely sexual.

She manipulates {{her way into}} the room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment.

This may be <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> themselves, or some other relation that <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> must later rescue. This division of the cohesive family injects initial tension into the storyline. This may serve as <b>the</b> <b>hero's</b> introduction, typically portraying them as an ordinary person.|$|R
50|$|After reestablishing {{communications}} with Tamiko, Judd, and Jian, <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> learns that <b>the</b> trio have tracked Shinjiro to the isolated mining community of Rattlesnake Canyon. <b>The</b> <b>Hero</b> then takes Songan's advice and uses an old locomotive in the town's deserted train depot to travel there.

5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones.

50|$|Sidekicks can fulfill one or {{multiple}} functions, {{such as a}} counterpoint to <b>the</b> <b>hero,</b> an alternate point of view, or knowledge, skills, or anything else <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> does not have. They often function as comic relief, and/or the straight man to <b>the</b> <b>hero's</b> comedic actions. A sidekick {{can also be a}} character to whom the audience can more easily relate than <b>the</b> <b>hero,</b> or whom <b>the</b> audience can imagine themselves as being (such as teen sidekicks). And by asking questions of <b>the</b> <b>hero,</b> or giving <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> someone to talk to, the sidekick provides an opportunity for the author to provide exposition, thereby filling the same role as a Greek chorus.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to The Limit and Babylon {{to defeat}} Crow's fighters, Carmen Electra takes notice of <b>The</b> <b>Hero.</b> As Electra or <b>The</b> <b>Hero</b> {{approach}} <b>the</b> other, the girlfriend becomes jealous and engages Electra to a fight.

50|$|Another common motif is <b>the</b> false <b>hero</b> whose wedding <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> barely {{arrives in}} time to interrupt, as in The Blue Mountains, The Raven, or The Three Princesses of Whiteland, but <b>the</b> <b>hero's</b> choice to travel is an unusual cause; {{normally}} <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> broke some prohibition, or was attacked by <b>the</b> false <b>hero</b> and severely injured, and so has difficulty reaching her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hero</b> Parade, despite <b>the</b> {{support of}} many in the public, was under {{constant}} financial pressure.

5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of <b>the</b> <b>heroes</b> and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5000|$|In {{laying out}} the monomyth, Campbell {{describes}} a number of stages or steps along this journey. <b>The</b> <b>hero</b> starts in <b>the</b> ordinary world, and receives a call to enter an unusual world of strange powers and events (a call to adventure). If <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> accepts <b>the</b> call to enter this strange world, <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> must face tasks and trials (a road of trials), and may have to face these trials alone, or may have assistance. At its most intense, <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> must survive a severe challenge, often with help earned along the journey. If <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> survives, <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> may achieve a great gift (the goal or [...] "boon"), which often results in the discovery of important self-knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>hero</b> must then decide whether to return with this boon (the return to the ordinary world), often facing challenges on the return journey. If <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> is successful in returning, the boon or gift {{may be used to}} improve the world (the application of the boon).|$|R

5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, or until <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> dies. <b>The</b> <b>hero</b> gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> or when <b>the</b> <b>Hero</b> kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|R
