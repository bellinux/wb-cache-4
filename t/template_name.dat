40|$|Purpose : Esteya and Valencia surface applicators are {{designed}} to treat skin tumors using brachytherapy. In clinical practice, {{in order to avoid}} errors that may affect the treatment outcome, there are two issues that need to be carefully addressed. First, the selected applicator for the treatment should provide adequate margin for the target, and second, the applicator has to be precisely positioned before each treatment fraction. In this work, we describe the development and use of a new acrylic <b>templates</b> <b>named</b> <b>Template</b> La Fe-ITIC. They have been designed specifically to help the clinical user in the selection of the correct applicator, and to assist the medical staff in reproducing the positioning of the applicator. These templates are freely available upon request. Material and methods: Templates that were developed by University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe (La Fe) and Hospital Clínica Benidorm (ITIC) in cooperation with Elekta, consist of a thin sheet made of transparent acrylic. For each applicator, a crosshair and two different circles are drawn on these templates: the inner one corresponds to the useful beam, while the outer one represents the external perimeter of the applicator. The outer circle contains slits that facilitate to draw a circle on the skin of the patient for exact positioning of the applicator. In addition, there are two perpendicular rulers to define the adequate margin. For each applicator size, a specific template was developed. Results: The templates have been used successfully in our institutions for more than 50 patients’ brachytherapy treatments. They are currently being used for Esteya and Valencia applicators. Conclusions : The template La Fe-ITIC is simple and practical. It improves both the set-up time and reproducibility. It helps to establish the adequate margins, an essential point in the clinical outcome...|$|R

40|$|Given {{that the}} {{morphology}} of Chinese brains statistically {{differs from that}} of Caucasian, there is an urgent need to develop a Chinese brain template for neuroimaging studies in Chinese populations. Based on a multi-center dataset, we developed a statistical Chinese brain <b>template,</b> <b>named</b> as Chinese 2020 (Liang et al., 2015). This new Chinese brain atlas has been validated in brain normalization and segmentation for anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies, and is publicly available at [URL] In our previous study, we have demonstrated this Chinese atlas showed higher accuracy in segmentation and relatively smaller shape deformations during registration. Because the spatial normalization of functional images is mainly based on the segmentation and normalization of anatomical image, the population-specific brain atlas should also be more appropriate for functional studies involving Chinese populations. The aim of this technology report is to validate the performance of Chinsese 2020 template in functional neuroimaging studies, and demonstrated that for Chinese population studies, the use of the Chinese 2010 template produces more valid results.

Of these, 13 underwent seed implantation guided by a 3 D print <b>template,</b> <b>named</b> the <b>template</b> group, and 14 underwent traditional implantation, named the traditional group. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan. Then, 3 D templates were printed in the template group. The implantation was guided by CT and 3 D templates. The patients in the traditional group underwent implantation with free hands guided by CT scan. Postplan was performed after the operation. The dose-volume histogram, D 90, and V 90 were calculated. The D 90 values pre- and post-operation were compared in each group. The postoperation V 90 values {{of the two groups}} were also compared. Results: The mean D 90 values pre- and post-operation in the template group were (87. 09 ± 33. 63) Gy and (85. 31 ± 34. 40) Gy, respectively, with no statistically significant difference. The mean D 90 values pre- and post-operation in the traditional group were (86. 04 ± 29. 93) Gy and (74. 96 ± 46. 10) Gy, respectively, with a statistically significant difference.

40|$|Memristor-based Computation-in-Memory {{is one of}} the {{emerging}} architectures proposed to deal with Big Data problems. The design of such architectures requires a radically new automatic design flow because the memristor is a passive device that uses resistance to encode its logic value. This paper proposes a design flow for mapping parallel algorithms on the CIM architecture. Algorithms with similar data flow graphs can be mapped on the crossbar using the same template containing scheduling, placement, and routing information; this <b>template</b> is <b>named</b> skeleton. By configuring such a skeleton with different pre-designed circuits, we can build CIM implementations of the corresponding algorithms in that class. This approach does not only map an algorithm on a memristor crossbar, but also gives an estimation of its performance, area, and energy consumption. It also supports user-defined constraints and parallel SystemC simulation. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the potential of the approach.
