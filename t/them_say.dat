5|$|In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum {{must first}} escape from Osgiliath, {{fighting}} past orcs {{to get to}} the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears <b>them</b> <b>say</b> that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E

500|$|The episode faced {{criticism}} from the crew over its ending using a deus ex machina {{to indicate that the}} Kindred may have been aliens. Producer James Wong felt that the episode's ending seemed overly abrupt and unexpected, describing it as appearing [...] "like we tried to play a trick on the audience to make <b>them</b> <b>say</b> 'Ooh, what the heck was that?. He added that the lack of a real connection to the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of catharsis for the viewer. Morgan said that the episode [...] "went too far.

[...] When asked about the similarity between the Kindred and the Amish, series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "they [...] don't watch TV, so I wasn't worried about it".|$|E
500|$|In December 1895, the Boston Daily Globe {{published}} a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston's [...] "quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman."

His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering around like a fish out of water, while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw.

2500|$|Compline ( [...] ), {{also known}} as Complin, Night Prayer, or the Prayers at the End of the Day, is the final church service (or office) {{of the day in}} the Christian {{tradition}} of canonical hours. The English word Compline is derived from the Latin completorium, as Compline is the completion of the working day. The word was first used in this sense about the beginning of the 6th century by St. Benedict in his Rule (Regula Benedicti; hereafter, RB), in Chapters , , , and , and he even uses the verb complere to signify Compline: [...] "Omnes ergo in unum positi compleant" [...] ("All having assembled in one place, let <b>them</b> <b>say</b> Compline"); [...] "et exeuntes a completorio" [...] ("and, after going out from Compline")...

2500|$|Masters {{attempted}} to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. [...] Masters {{had refused to}} make films with synchronous sound until 1983—long after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because {{the kind of people}} we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't do any of these things, and it's just going to be absurd to make <b>them</b> <b>say</b> things when they aren't going to say them well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdullah {{denied the}} accusation, stating: [...] "If I was a people smuggler, why would I put {{my family in}} the same boat as the other people? I paid the same amount to the people smugglers." [...] and [...] "I lost my family, I lost my life, I lost everything, so let <b>them</b> <b>say</b> {{whatever}} they want." [...] According to Turkish authorities, investigations into the smuggling operations in Turkey showed that refugees were often tasked with helping smugglers sign up passengers for smuggling trips. It was also not uncommon for one of the passengers to be given the responsibility of driving the boat. No smuggler, with family in Turkey and a steady income from the lucrative smuggling trade, would want to end up illegally in Europe and risk not being able to return home, where he would be likely to face arrest anyway. The President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered Alan's father Abdullah citizenship of Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, {{portrayed by}} Anthony Geary and Genie Francis from General Hospital, are {{considered}} the most famous soap opera supercouple. Their romance enthralled viewers; when they wed on November 16, 1981, American daytime television recorded its highest-ever ratings, with 30 million people tuning in to watch <b>them</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I do". Elizabeth Taylor made a cameo appearance during the wedding, and Princess Diana reportedly sent champagne. The couple was featured {{on the covers of}} People and Newsweek, and was credited with having brought [...] "legitimacy to daytime serials" [...] and its fans by crossing boundaries and becoming celebrities in the mainstream media. As a result, Luke and Laura have become regarded as daytime television's quintessential and most iconic couple. While Guiding Light has the smallest number of supercouples, the series still had prominent pairings, notably Quint and Nola, as well as Josh and Reva, one of the central supercouples from the 1980s onward. In 1982, All My Childrens Jesse and Angie became the first black supercouple.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Gans, {{a former}} Cryptanalyst at the National Security Agency, argued that MBBK's {{hypothesis}} implies a conspiracy between WRR and their co-contributors to fraudulently tune the appellations in advance. Gans {{argues that the}} conspiracy must include Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and S. Z. Havlin, because all of <b>them</b> <b>say</b> that Havlin compiled the appellations independently. Gans argues further that such a conspiracy must include the multiple rabbis who have written a letter confirming the accuracy of Havlin's list. Finally, argues Gans, such a conspiracy must also include the multiple participants of the cities experiment conducted by Gans (which includes Gans himself). Gans concludes that [...] "the number of people necessarily involved in [...] will stretch the credulity of any reasonable person." [...] Gans further argued that while [...] "the mathematical issues are difficult for non-mathematicians to comprehend, I can summarize as follows: Professor McKay and his colleagues never claimed to have discovered real codes in those non-Torah texts. Their only “successful” results were obtained by deliberately rigging the experiment {{in such a way}} that the layman wouldn’t recognize the mathematical flaws." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{the fourth}} dispute asserts that {{judgment}} {{is coming in}} the form of a messenger who [...] "is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap [...] [...] [...]" [...] (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute – that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has Yahweh request the people to [...] "Bring the full tithe [...] [...] [...] [...] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing" [...] (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of Israel illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has <b>them</b> <b>say</b> [...] "'It is vain to serve God [...] [...] [...] Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'" [...] (3:14–15). Once again, Malachi has Yahweh assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his arrival}} at Charles Town, Edgerton found the {{commander}} of Harper's Ferry, General William Taliaferro. Edgerton told Taliaferro about his request, but Taliaferro informed him that Governor Wise would only allow family and a minister to visit John Brown. That night, Taliaferro arranged for a wagon {{to take him back}} to Washington D.C. Edgerton was given a driver and a guard, for his journey. During his ride back, a group of men on horses rode up, and Edgerton's guard jumped out of the wagon and ran. The men on horses retrieved the man, and brought him back to the wagon. Edgerton asked his guard why he ran, and the guard replied, [...] "I heard <b>them</b> <b>say</b> that they would kill [...] ". The men on horses then attempted to get Edgerton to leave the wagon, but he refused. He eventually made it out of Virginia, but always believed had he left the wagon, the men would have killed him. After this encounter, Edgerton viewed Southerners, generally, with contempt. Edgerton continued to be a large voice in the anti-slavery movement, but decided not to run for reelection in 1862.|$|E
2500|$|Sports {{injuries}} {{are often the}} result of overuse or trauma to {{a part of the}} body. [...] An issue unique to youth athletics is that the participants’ bones are still growing, making them especially at risk for injury. Around 8,000 children are rushed to the emergency room daily because of sports injuries. High school athletes suffer approximately 715,000 injuries annually. In American football, for instance, five times as many catastrophic injuries happen in high school as in college-level competition. Injuries include heat illness and dehydration, concussions, and trauma-related deaths. [...] Heat illnesses are a rising concern in youth athletics. These illnesses include heat syncope, muscle cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and exertional hyponatremia. [...] Each year, high school athletes sustain 300,000 head injuries, of which 90% are concussions. By the start of high school, 53% of athletes will have already suffered a concussion, but fewer than 50% of <b>them</b> <b>say</b> anything because they are concerned they will be removed from play. Ice hockey, soccer, lacrosse, wrestling and basketball have a high risk of concussion, with football carrying the most risk. A history of concussion in a football player can contribute to sports-related sudden death.|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I told them what to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let <b>them</b> <b>say</b> exactly what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit.
