40|$|Growth {{promoters}} including hormonal {{substances and}} antibiotics are used legally and illegally in food producing animals {{for the growth}} promotion of livestock animals. Hormonal substances still under debate {{in terms of their}} human health impacts are estradiol- 17 β, progesterone, testosterone, zeranol, <b>trenbolone,</b> and melengestrol <b>acetate</b> (MGA). Many of the risk assessment results of natural steroid hormones have presented negligible impacts when they are used under good veterinary practices. For synthetic hormone-like substances, ADIs and MRLs have been established for food safety along with the approval of animal treatment. Small amounts of antibiotics added to feedstuff present growth promotion effects via the pre-vention of infectious diseases at doses lower than therapeutic dose. The induction of antimicrobial resis-tant bacteria and the disruption of normal human intestinal flora are major concerns in terms of human health impact. Regulatory guidance such as ADIs and MRLs fully reflect the impact on human gastrointes-tinal microflora. However, before deciding on any risk management options, risk assessments of antimi-crobial resistance require large-scale evidence regarding the relationship between antimicrobial use in food-producing animals and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. In this article, the risk profiles of hormonal and antibacterial growth promoters are provided based on recent toxicity and human exposure information, and recommendations for risk management to prevent human health impacts by the use of growth promoters are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) are {{compounds that}} alter the production, secretion, action, and elimination of endogenous hormones. EDCs {{have been shown}} to be responsible for disrupting development, reproduction, immune function, behavior, and all other life functions mediated by hormones. In the environment, organisms are exposed to many different types of EDCs at any one time, each with different mechanisms of action, many of which are not fully understood at present. Most research done with EDCs has focused on the effects of these chemicals on the estrogen and thyroid systems, however, many of these same chemicals also exert strong effects on the androgen system. Also, many studies assessing the effects of EDCs on wildlife have focused on reproductive measures of exposure, often overlooking potential effects on the immune system. We have demonstrated that embryonic exposure to androgen-active EDCs, anti-androgenic DDE and androgenic <b>trenbolone</b> <b>acetate,</b> impairs development of the bursa of Fabricius in Japanese quail, providing a possible mechanism for EDC-induced immunosuppression. The bursa is a primary immune organ responsible for development of the humoral part of the immune system. We have also demonstrated that the bursa can be resilient to embryonic exposure to EDCs, if post-hatch exposure to these chemicals is prevented. Measures of reproduction, behavior, growth, and developmental stability were also taken in this study. Male and female rates to sexual maturity were altered by the one-time in ovo exposure to DDE and trenbolone. Male reproductive behavior, as measured by attempts to mount and successful cloacal contacts achieved, was suppressed by both chemicals. Vocalization was abolished in one and two week old chicks from the highest <b>trenbolone</b> <b>acetate</b> treatment levels.

Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the occurrence of 17 α- and 17 β-trenbolone in a beef cattle feedlot discharge and in river water upstream and downstream from the discharge. In conjunction with that effort, we measured in vitro androgenic activity of the discharge using CV- 1 cells that had been transiently cotransfected with human androgen receptor and reporter gene constructs. Samples were collected on nine different occasions during 2002 and 2003. Whole-water samples from the discharge caused a significant androgenic response in the CV- 1 cells and contained detectable concentrations of 17 α- and 17 β-trenbolone.

Although not statistically significant, the observed mean for the BSA-E+TBA treatment suggests improved ADG and TDN per unit of gain, indicating a possible immunization X TBA interaction. Data also suggested that heifers implanted with TBA had increased ADG and efficiencies of gain. Possibly, immunoneutralization of endogenous estradiol can improve ADG as compared with control and OVX groups. Treatments had no effect on color or texture of lean muscle at the 12 th rib interface. The OVX + TBA group had less (P 3 ̆c. O 1) 12 th rib fat cover than other groups and lower percent fat in the rib than C. The BSA-E+TBA and TBA groups also possessed larger (P 3 ̆c. 02) longissimus muscle areas than the control group. Observations of juiciness, tenderness and flavor were similar among all treatments. Results indicate that implanting heifers with TBA and (or) immunizing against endogenous estradiol may provide opportunities to increase gains, feed conversions and lean-to-fat ratios in heifers...|$|E
40|$|In a {{commercial}} feedyard trial, 242 Holstein steer calves averaging 378 lb {{were used to}} compare effects of six alternative implant programs, consisting of sequential use of Synovex-S® {{or a combination of}} estradiol and <b>trenbolone</b> <b>acetate</b> (Revalor-S® or Finaplix- S® plus Synovex-S®), on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. The calves were implanted three times at 78 - to 90 -day intervals while on feed an average of 252 days. The combination implant increased (P<. 05) gain by. 13 to. 21 lb per day in all three implant periods compared to Synovex alone. Total feedlot gain was increased in direct relation to the number of times steers received the combination implant. However, marbling score and the percentage of carcasses grading USDA Choice tended to be reduced with repeated use of Revalor or Finaplix...|$|E
