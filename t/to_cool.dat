5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> themselves in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E

5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Japan is {{predominantly}} temperate, but varies greatly {{from north to}} south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E

50|$|Cooling ponds {{are used}} where {{sufficient}} land is available, {{as an alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>cooling</b> towers or discharging of heated water to a nearby river or coastal bay, {{a process known as}} “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause thermal pollution of the receiving waters. Cooling ponds are also sometimes used with air conditioning systems in large buildings as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>cooling</b> towers. Cooling towers are not a good choice because their internal surfaces have been coated with a non-approved paint such as bitumen or epoxy, as a result cooling ponds are a better option.|$|R

5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> a large mass of masonry {{with cool}} nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, {{the warmth of}} the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry.

5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
