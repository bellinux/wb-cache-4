5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E

The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair {{spent much}} of his life in the Hebrides and made {{frequent}} references to them in his poetry, including in An Airce and Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill. The best known Gaelic poet of her era, Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), embodied the spirit of the land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. This, and her powerful evocation of the Hebrides—she was from Skye—has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets. Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), who spent his adult life on Eriskay and South Uist, composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child,</b> and the Eucharist. In his secular poetry, MacDonald praised the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampooned the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>child</b> on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

He holds his hat in hand, and his pattens are respectfully removed, left {{lying on the}} ground. They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary's robe. [...] Mary's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus's later paintings and remarkably similar to his Madonna of the Dry Tree, according to Maryan Ainsworth. [...] Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels.|$|R
25|$|Mary, as {{the mother}} of Jesus, is {{documented}} in Roman catacombs: paintings from {{the first half of the}} 2nd century show her holding <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child.</b> Excavations in the crypt of St Peter's Basilica uncovered a very early fresco of Mary together with Saint Peter.|$|E
25|$|Western {{types of}} the Virgin’s image, {{such as the}} twelfth-century “Throne of Wisdom”, in which <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> is {{presented}} frontally as the sum of divine wisdom, seem to have originated in Byzantium.

25|$|In {{churches that}} are monastic, {{there is often}} an {{emphasis}} on the saints that belonged to that particular order.

50|$|Barbers was a pious {{devotee of}} the Santo Niño, as {{evidenced}} by the various icons of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>Christ</b> which adorned his office. He credited the Santo Niño for every success, including the criminal cases he had solved and all his electoral victories. Because of his devotion to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>Christ,</b> and for being a law enforcer, Barbers came up with a Santo Niño image dressed in police uniform, which {{came to be known as}} the Sto.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the monumental commissions he completed, Verhulst made small-scale ivory carvings, a specialty for which his home town Mechelen was particularly known. A small ivory Virgin and Child held in the Rijksmuseum shows his skill in this regard. He has carved the thick, wavy locks of hair of <b>the</b> chubby <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> and <b>the</b> heavy drapery with such realism that they appear almost tangible.|$|R
25|$|The German {{bishop and}} poet Walter of Speyer portrayed St. Christopher {{as a giant}} of a cynocephalic species {{in the land of}} the Chananeans who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>child,</b> regretted his former behavior, and {{received}} baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an athlete of God, one of the soldier-saints.|$|E
25|$|The wooden {{image of}} <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> is also Baroque {{from the first}} half of the 18th century. It was destined for an oratory and when created it was sitting on some sort of chair. In the third quarter of the 18th century a bed of wood was made for it, in the Rococo style. From the moment it was {{presented}} to the church it has had great popular appeal, especially at Christmas time when it is kissed by the faithful.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes saints {{are shown}} {{together}} {{in a sort of}} pictorial gallery, but the depiction of narratives is also common. This may {{take the form of a}} single incident, such as Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and bristling with arrows or St Christopher carrying <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>Child</b> across the river, or the saint's life may be shown in a narrative sequence, similar to the way in which the life of Jesus is depicted, such as the Life of St Augustine by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Church of Sant' Agostino, San Gimignano.|$|E
50|$|The statue still retains {{enough of}} its {{polychromy}} to ascertain its original appearance. The throne was coloured an ochre red with the knops being picked out in gilt, the cloak was dark blue with the inner folds red. The ground beneath Mary's feet was a characterictic dark green scattered {{with red and}} white daisies and her crown, sceptre, mantle fastenings and <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>child's</b> hair were all gilded. These bright colours were characteristic of Nottingham Alabaster since they, for the most part, were designed to be housed in wooden altarpieces with painted shutters and {{to be seen by}} candlelight in dimly lit churches. The fact that the statue is flat backed and almost bas relief in places makes it likely that it was intended for just such an altarpiece.|$|R
50|$|Two other drawings, in metalpoint {{with white}} lead {{highlights}} on blue prepared paper, {{are attributed to}} a follower of Leonardo, usually considered to be Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio. One, a study for <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>child's</b> head, is in the Fondation Custodia in Paris; the other, in the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, is a drapery study for the Virgin’s garments. These {{have been attributed to}} Boltraffio {{on the basis of the}} Berlin drawing's similarity to other drapery studies by the artist. It has been argued that the Paris and Berlin drawings are preparatory studies for the Madonna Litta rather than copies after it, as the drapery study shows more of the Virgin’s right arm than the finished work, in which this is obscured by Christ’s head. This suggests that the composition was partly pieced together from these studies.|$|R
