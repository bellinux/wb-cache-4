25|$|In 1968 Baldessin {{opened an}} art {{studio in the}} Winfield building, Melbourne; {{over the next few}} years, the place evolved into a vibrant atelier and meeting place for young artists and students. In 1970 he was awarded the Geelong Print Prize, and in 1971 he won the Comalco Invitation Award for Sculpture for having invented silver {{aluminium}} foil print. Some of the other awards he received include the Maitland Print Prize (1967 and 1970), the Shepparton Print Prize (1970, shared with Jan Senbergs), and a Drawing Prize at the Second International Biennale for Drawing in Yugoslavia (1970). In 1974, following his retrospective exhibit at the Mornington Peninsula Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Australia acquired 279 of Baldessin's etching plates and prints: this set was the first nucleus of the National Gallery's collection of his works. Together with Imants <b>Tillers,</b> Baldessin represented Australia at the XIII São Paulo Art Biennial in 1975, exhibiting the set of etchings Occasional Images from a City Chamber, and the sculptural work Occasional Screens with Seating Arrangement. From 1975 to 1977 Baldessin lived in Paris; during his French sojourn he attended the Lacourière-Frélaut engraving workshop and hung out with Imants <b>Tillers,</b> soon becoming close friends with him.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{encouraging}} mutli-national {{businesses to}} meet the needs of the poor, some organizations such as iDE, the World Resources Institute, and the United Nations Development Programme began to focus on working directly with helping bottom-of-the-pyramid populations become local, small-scale entrepreneurs. Since so much of this population is engaged in agriculture, these NGOs have addressed market gaps that enable small-scale (i.e., plots less than 2 hectares) farmers to increase their production and find markets for their harvests. This is done by increasing the availability of farming equipment (e.g., pumps, <b>tillers,</b> seeders) and better quality seed and fertilizer, as well as expanding access for training in farming best practices (e.g., crop rotation).|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{within the field}} of {{agriculture}} that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels {{from the beginning of the}} process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage <b>tillers</b> and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

The primary adaptive response is a variable degree of branching, called <b>tillering</b> in cereals. Especially for heterogeneous plant configurations the degree of <b>tillering</b> varies per plant. Functional–structural plant modeling (FSPM) is a modeling approach allowing simulation of the architectural development of individual plants, culminating in the emergent behavior at the canopy level.

40|$|<b>Tillering</b> {{can make}} an {{important}} contribution to grain yield in sorghum, but is strongly affected by both genotype (G) and environment (E). Despite genetic variation for the trait, previous studies have been confined to a limited number of genotypes and the physiological mechanisms and causes of genotypic differences in <b>tillering</b> in sorghum remain unclear. To exploit the trait in sorghum improvement, the genotypic and environmental effects on <b>tillering</b> and their interactions need to be understood. The present study aims to explore the extent and nature of genetic variation for <b>tillering</b> in sorghum and the interaction of these genetic effects with variation in environment. A set of 90 - 100 lines and hybrids with diverse origin but structured genetic background was characterized for <b>tillering</b> and related traits in both a low <b>tillering</b> (glass house environment with low light intensity) and a high <b>tillering</b> (spaced planting in the field) environment. <b>Tiller</b> number per plant varied from 0 - 8 and 0 – 16 in the low and high <b>tillering</b> environments respectively. Comparisons between the ranks in the two experiments indicated that GxE for <b>tillering</b> was significant. Results for hybrids indicated that the expression of <b>tillering</b> is primarily additive, although partial dominance was present in some hybrids. Significant correlations of leaf width and internode diameter with <b>tillering</b> indicated a possible involvement of these traits in the regulation of <b>tillering.</b> An analysis of combining ability revealed the potential of SC 62 C as a germplasm source for high <b>tillering.</b> The wide range of variation in <b>tillering</b> also provides the basis for future mapping studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tillering</b> in sorghum can be {{associated}} with either the carbon supply–demand (S/D) balance of the plant or an intrinsic propensity to <b>tiller</b> (PTT). Knowledge of the genetic control of <b>tillering</b> could assist breeders in selecting germplasm with <b>tillering</b> characteristics appropriate for their target environments. The aims of this study were to identify QTL for <b>tillering</b> and component traits associated with the S/D balance or PTT, to develop a framework model for the genetic control of <b>tillering</b> in sorghum. Four mapping populations were grown in a number of experiments in south east Queensland, Australia. The QTL analysis suggested that the contribution of traits associated with either the S/D balance or PTT to the genotypic differences in <b>tillering</b> differed among populations. Thirty-four <b>tillering</b> QTL were identified across the populations, of which 15 were novel to this study. Additionally, half of the <b>tillering</b> QTL co-located with QTL for component traits. A comparison of <b>tillering</b> QTL and candidate gene locations identified numerous coincident QTL and gene locations across populations, including the identification of common non-synonymous SNPs in the parental genotypes of two mapping populations in a sorghum homologue of MAX 1, a gene involved in the control of <b>tiller</b> bud outgrowth through the production of strigolactones. Combined with a framework for crop physiological processes that underpin genotypic differences in <b>tillering,</b> the co-location of QTL for <b>tillering</b> and component traits and candidate genes allowed the development of a framework QTL model for the genetic control of <b>tillering</b> in sorghum...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tillering</b> is {{a plastic}} trait of cereals that affects grain yield and {{adaptability}} through {{the regulation of}} leaf area development and fertile <b>tiller</b> production. Though the trait is important for crop adaptation, its physiology and genetics are poorly understood.

2500|$|Initially {{a source}} of ethnographic interest, and later an artistic {{movement}} with roots outside Western art traditions, indigenous art was influenced by, and had influence upon, few European Australian artists.
