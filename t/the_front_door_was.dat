25|$|Vincent's {{remains were}} too badly {{decomposed}} {{to conduct a}} full post-mortem, {{and she had to}} be identified from dental records. Police ruled death by natural causes as there was nothing to suggest foul play: <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> double locked and {{there was no sign of}} a break-in. At the time of her death she had a boyfriend, but the police were unable to trace him. Her sisters had hired a private detective to look for her and contacted the Salvation Army, but these attempts proved unsuccessful. The detective found the house where Vincent was living, and the family wrote letters to her. But as she was already dead by this time, they received no response, and the family assumed that she had deliberately broken ties with them.|$|E
25|$|Architectural {{punctuation}} of the terraces' front elevations {{was provided}} by tall gables to the terminal and central houses. In the north section the outer terraces had gables intermediate between the central and terminal houses. Different designs of gable window were used in different terraces. Left and right handed houses were used to provide symmetry. In a left-handed house <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> {{to the left of}} the ground floor window. In a-right handed house it was to the right. The handedness changed in the centre of the terrace and was marked by a gable house. Between the gable house and its partner was a double chimney stack. Thus there were no chimney stacks on the terminal walls of the terrace and each terminal wall had a front door adjacent to it.|$|E
25|$|This wing was {{constructed}} in 1627 {{at right angles to}} the old keep using rubble faced with dressed with sandstone ashlar. A door was broken through from the hall of the old keep to a staircase in the mansion house. The mansion was a fine specimen of 17th-century architecture. It had turrets corbelled out at hall level and these contained closets. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> set in an unusual shallow projection and a narrow back door at the north facing aspect led into a courtyard. Two cellars existed with a passage between them that connected with the main staircase. The hall in the old tower may have been used as a dining area and the large room in the mansion house utilised as a drawing-room. The most southerly turret and a large part of mansion house wing fell at some point between 1956 and 1964.|$|E

25|$|L11 - Built in 1964 {{from two}} 1931 Standard Stock {{vehicles}} (numbers 3080 and 3109), this vehicle {{followed the same}} concept as L10, as both donor vehicles had some of their passenger compartments cut off and the two cabs and control sections were joined back to back. The resulting locomotive was a single vehicle Bo-Bo. A small section of the passenger compartment remained, {{and most of the}} air system and braking equipment was moved into it from beneath the frames, so that it could be more easily maintained. The vehicle had four WT54A motors, which were wired so that each pair remained permanently in series. Thus they worked at half voltage, but the slow-speed characteristics were better-suited for shunting. Dual couplings for tube and sub-surface stock were fitted at the Acton end only. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> blocked off, but had a low-level screen, to enable the driver to see the couplings more easily. When first built, it carried a maroon livery, but was painted yellow in 1983. It saw use until the early 1990s and since preservation in 2004, has been on display outside Epping tube station.|$|E
500|$|By contrast, the Antandroy {{inhabit the}} Madagascar spiny thickets, an {{extremely}} dry and hot {{region in the}} south of Madagascar where unique forms of drought-resistant plants have evolved and thrived. [...] Their homes are traditionally square (not rectangular), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These homes traditionally had no windows and featured three wooden doors: <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> the women's entrance, the door {{at the rear of the}} house was for children, and the third door was used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E
500|$|Despite Alcatraz being {{designed}} {{to house the}} [...] "worst of the worst" [...] of criminals who caused problems at other prisons, under the guidelines and regulations set by the strict prison administrators, courts could not direct a prisoner to be directly sent to Alcatraz, however notorious they were for misbehavior and attempted escape from other prisons. Prisoners entering Alcatraz would undergo vigorous research and assessments prior to their arrival. Security in the prison was very tight, with the constant checking of bars, doors, locks, electrical fixtures, and other areas to ensure that security hadn't been broken. During a standard day the prisoners would be counted 13 times, and the ratio of prisoners to guards was the lowest of any American prison of the time. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> made of solid steel, virtually impossible for any prisoners to escape through. The island had many guard towers, most of which have since been demolished, which were heavily guarded at various points in the day at times when security may have been breached; for instance, there were guard towers {{on each of the}} industry buildings to ensure that inmates didn't attempt to escape during the work day shifts. The recreation yard {{and other parts of the}} prison had a 25-foot fence around it topped with barbed wire, should any inmates attempt to escape during exercise. One former employee of the jail likened his prison job to being a zoo keeper or his old farm job, due to the fact that prisoners were treated like animals, sending them out to [...] "plough the fields" [...] when some of them worked during the day, and then counting them up and feeding them and so on. He referred to those four years of his life working in the prison as a [...] "total waste of his life". The corridors were regularly patrolled by the guards, with passing gates along them; the most heavily trafficked corridor was [...] "Broadway" [...] between B and C Block, due to its being the central corridor of the prison and passed not only by guards but other prison workers.|$|E

2500|$|Despite these successes, the {{campaign}} {{did not go}} according to plan. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> [...] "kicked in", but the Red Army was not destroyed, and the Soviet state did not collapse. Once this became apparent, {{at the end of}} July, Hitler and his commanders had to decide how to proceed. Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to pause at Smolensk, while the panzer divisions were shipped to the north and the south.|$|E
