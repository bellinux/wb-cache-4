5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> <b>On</b> September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|Although not proven, {{recent data}} from the Galileo orbiter {{indicate}} that Io might have its own magnetic field. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide (SO2). If a surface data or collection vessel were <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> Io in the future, {{it would have to}} be extremely tough (similar to the tank-like bodies of the Soviet Venera landers) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Cold Bay, {{the city}} nearest Amak, is easily {{accessible}} by plane. Amak is {{accessible only by}} boat; airplanes are not permitted <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the island.

5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there. If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2016, Sukhoi Su-33 {{fighter jets}} began {{conducting}} combat flights over Syria from Admiral Kuznetsovs flight deck {{in the ongoing}} Syrian civil war.

5|$|The {{finalized}} {{plan for}} the assault called for between nine and eleven gliders <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the western bank of the Albert Canal by {{each of the three}} bridges just prior to 05:30 on 10 May, the time scheduled for Fall Gelb to begin. The groups assigned to assault the three bridges would overwhelm the defending Belgian troops, remove any demolition charges and then prepare to defend the bridges against an expected counter-attack. Forty minutes later, three Ju-52 transport aircraft would fly over each position, dropping a further twenty-four airborne troops as reinforcements as well as machine-guns and significant amounts of ammunition. Simultaneously, the force assigned to assault Fort Eben-Emael was <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> top of the Fort in eleven gliders, eliminate any defenders attempting to repel them, cripple what artillery they could with explosive charges, and then prevent the Garrison from dislodging them. Having achieved their initial objectives of seizing the bridges and eliminating the long-range artillery pieces possessed by the Fort, the airborne troops would then defend their positions until the arrival of German ground forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season Ross {{returned and}} located an inlet in the Barrier face that enabled him, on 23 January 1842, {{to extend his}} Farthest South to 78°09'30"S, a record which would remain unchallenged for 58years. Although Ross {{had not been able}} <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the Antarctic continent, nor approach the location of the South Magnetic Pole, on his return to England in 1843 he was knighted for his achievements in geographical and scientific exploration.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125mi (210km) out from the center {{to the north and}} east. Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> <b>On</b> July2, a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July4, Amy passed roughly 170mi (270km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E
5|$|Bristol was a {{starting}} place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, {{became the first}} European since the Vikings <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At {{the height of the}} Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten {{arrived in}} the {{afternoon}} and took over responsibility. Later, the ship Mira, belonging to Bergen Steamship Company (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, material from the Red Cross, specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and Norway Post, and journalists. The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
