40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} of a generalized constraint handling method that does not require parameter tuning. Within engineering design problems, constraints can be classified as explicit or implicit. Explicit constraints can be checked without requiring any type of simulation. For example, in the traveling salesman problem (<b>TSP)</b> <b>each</b> city must be visited once and only once. This constraint can be checked without calculating the tour distance. An implicit constraint is one that requires a simulation to check for a violation, and may have limits that are solution dependent. For example, in a hydraulic system many different components can be chosen, and their selection is tightly coupled. If a pump is chosen which is too large for the other components in the system, the pressure limits in the other system components may be exceeded causing a failure that can be quite dangerous. These pressure limits are dependent on the component characteristics specified by the manufacturer. In this paper, we will address only those techniques that can handle both explicit and implicit constraints. Handling Infeasibilit...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of this plant extract on methanogenesis, total-tract digestibility, and lactating performances of dairy cows. The work included 2 independent and successive experiments. First, the effect of 7 tea saponin doses (from 0 to 0. 50 g/L) on methane emissions and protozoa concentrations was tested in 2 repeated in vitro batch culture incubations using bovine rumen contents as inoculum and a cereal mixture as substrate. After 18 h of incubation, total gas production and composition as well as rumen fermentation parameters and protozoa concentration were analyzed. Increasing dosage of the plant extract reduced methane production and protozoa concentration, with a maximum reduction of 29 % for CH 4 (mL/g of substrate) and 51 % for protozoa (10 (5) /mL). Tea saponin did not affect volatile fatty acids concentration, but marginally decreased total gas production by 5 % at the highest dose. Second, a 2 -period crossover design experiment was carried out with 8 lactating dairy cows fed a basal diet (54 % corn silage, 6 % hay, and 40 % pelleted concentrates on a dry matter basis) without (control) or with 0. 52 % tea saponin (<b>TSP).</b> <b>Each</b> experimental period lasted 5 wk. Animals were fed ad libitum during the first 3 wk of the period (wk 1, 2, and 3) and restricted (95 % of ad libitum intake) during the last 2 wk (wk 4 and 5). Intake and milk production were recorded daily. Methane emissions were quantified using open chambers (2 d, wk 4). Total-tract digestibility and nitrogen balance were determined from total feces and urine collected separately (5 d, wk 5). Rumen fermentation parameters and protozoa concentration were analyzed from samples taken after morning feeding (1 d, wk 5). Milk production, dry matter intake, and feed-efficiency were reduced with TSP (- 18, - 12, and - 8 %, respectively). As daily methane production (g/d) was not affected, methane emissions (g/kg of dry matter intake) increased by 14 % with TSP. Total-tract digestibility and nitrogen balance were similar between diets, except for acid detergent fiber digestibility, which tended to be improved with TSP (+ 4 percentage units).

TSP 1 and a CD 36 antibody that mimics the activity of TSP 1 inhibited myristate uptake. Recombinant TSP 1 type 1 repeats were weakly inhibitory, but an anti-angiogenic peptide derived from this domain potently inhibited myristate uptake. This peptide also inhibited membrane translocation of the myristoylated CD 36 signaling target Fyn and activation of Src family kinases. Myristate uptake stimulated cGMP synthesis via endothelial nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase.

A secondary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of α 2 agonist on selected serum biochemical parameters and splenic size in order to identify potential causes for the changes seen in PCV and TSP. Four healthy adult mares were treated in a blinded, randomized, cross-over design with a single dose of xylazine (0. 5 mg/kg), romifidine (0. 04 mg/kg) or detomidine (0. 01 mg/kg) intravenously, or detomidine (0. 02 mg/kg) intramuscularly. A 1 -week washout period was allowed between treatments. Haematology, TSP, COP, plasma osmolality, glucose, BUN, serum lactate, electrolytes, venous blood pH, ultrasonographic splenic size and degree of clinical sedation were evaluated at different time points post-injection and compared to baseline values. All treatments induced similar clinical sedation in the mares. A significant change over time in PCV and <b>TSP</b> following <b>each</b> treatment was identified, with overall median (range) maximal reductions compared to baseline of 20. 9 % (12. 9 - 27. 3 %) and 5. 8 % (3. 0 - 10. 3 %), respectively. Additionally, changes over time were significant for RBC count, BUN, COP and Ca 2 +, which decreased; and glucose, plasma osmolality, Na+ and splenic size, which increased, when compared to baseline. There was no significant main effect of treatment on PCV, TSP or any other parameters measured except for glucose. This study concluded that changes in PCV, TSP and other biochemical parameters induced by α 2 agonists should be taken into consideration when assessing critically ill horses that received these drugs.

At the same treatment on a variety of media is obtained that the maximum growth rate of Spirulina platensis is μ = 0. 128 /day. The nutrient savings gained from the use of POME as a cultivation media is: Carbon by 42, 23 % - 129, 71 % and 41, 46 % - 124. 44 %. for Nitrogen. This research also showed that C,N,P contents of POME decrease by 20, 60 % - 84, 69 %; 87, 52 % - 93, 47 % and 29, 44 % - 76, 66 % respectively...|$|R
40|$|Numerous mapping {{projects}} {{conducted on}} different species have generated {{an abundance of}} mapping data. Consequently, many multilocus maps have been constructed using diverse mapping populations and marker sets for the same organism. The quality of maps varies broadly among populations, marker sets, and software used, necessitating efforts to integrate the mapping information and generate consensus maps. The problem of consensus genetic mapping (MCGM) is by far more challenging compared with genetic mapping based on a single dataset, which by itself is also cumbersome. The additional complications introduced by consensus analysis include inter-population differences in recombination rate and exchange distribution along chromosomes; variations in dominance of the employed markers; and use of different subsets of markers in different labs. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} handle arbitrary patterns of shared sets of markers and different level of mapping data quality. In this article, we introduce a two-phase approach for solving MCGM. In phase 1, for each dataset, multilocus ordering is performed combined with iterative jackknife resampling to evaluate the stability of marker orders. In this phase, the ordering problem is reduced to the well-known traveling salesperson problem (<b>TSP).</b> Namely, for <b>each</b> dataset, we look for order that gives minimum sum of recombination distances between adjacent markers. In phase 2, the optimal consensus order of shared markers is selected from the set of allowed orders and gives the minimal sum of total lengths of nonconflicting maps of the chromosome. This criterion may be used in different modifications {{to take into account the}} variation in quality of the original data (population size, marker quality, etc.). In the foregoing formulation, consensus mapping is considered as a specific version of TSP that can be referred to as “synchronized TSP. ” The conflicts detected after phase 1 are resolved using either a heuristic algorithm over the entire chromosome or an exact/heuristic algorithm applied subsequently to the revealed small non-overlapping regions with conflicts separated by non-conflicting regions. The proposed approach was tested on a wide range of simulated data and real datasets from maize...|$|R
40|$|Two {{or three}} {{dimensional}} mission {{plans for a}} single {{or a group of}} hover or fixed wing UAVs are generated. The mission plans can largely be separated into seven main parts. Firstly, the Region Growing algorithm is used to generate a map from 2 D or 3 D images. Secondly, the map is analyzed to separate each blocks using vertices of blocks and seven filtering steps. Thirdly, the Trapezoidal map algorithm is used to convert the map into a traversability graph. Fourthly, this process also filters out paths that are not traversable. That is, nodes located inside the blocks and too closely located nodes are filtered out. Fifthly, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path from a starting point to a goal point. Sixthly, the 1 D Optimal Control algorithm is applied to manipulate the velocity and acceleration of the UAVs efficiently. Basically, the UAVs accelerates at one graph node and maintains a constant velocity and decelerates before reaching the next graph node. Lastly, Traveling Salesman Problem Method (TSP) algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path to search the whole region. After this discretization of space and time, it becomes possible to solve several autonomous mission planning problems. We focus {{on one of the most}} difficult problems: coordinated search. This is a multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). We solve it by decomposing the search region and solving <b>TSPs</b> for <b>each</b> vehicle searching a sub-region. The mTSP is generally used when there are more than one salesman is used. ^ In addition to the four main parts, there are three minor parts which support the main parts. Firstly, Target Detection algorithm is generated to detect a target located near the UAVs 2 ̆ 7 path. A picture of the desired target is inserted into the algorithm before UAVs launch. Using the Scale-Invariant Transform Feature (SIFT) algorithm, a target with a specific shape can be detected. Secondly, Tracking algorithm is generated to manipulate UAVs to follow targets. Once one or several targets are detected, UAVs near the target are manipulated to approach to the target. If the number of detected targets is more than one, UAVs are evenly grouped to track targets. After a specific period of time, UAVs hand off and continue their original tasks. Thirdly, Emergency algorithm is generated to avoid losses of UAVs when UAVs have system failures. If one UAV is out of fuel or control during the mission, the Emergency algorithm brings the malfunctioning UAV to the point of departure and let the rest UAVs to continue an aerial reconnaissance. An UAV which finishes its task the earliest will continue to search a region which the failed UAV is supposed to search. In addition, Emergency algorithm prevents UAVs colliding into each other by using emergency altitude. ^ Overall, the framework developed here facilitates the solution of several mission planning problems. The robustness built into our discretization of space and time permits feedback corrections on real-time to vehicle trajectories. The library of off-line solutions proposed and developed here minimizes computational overhead during operations. ...|$|R

The {{concentration}} of Cd in the soil will increase if phosphate fertilizer is applied, because Cd {{is available in the}} sediment rock of phosphate as a raw material for phosphate fertilizer. Recently it is said that simplicia of medicinal crops originated from Asia is contaminated with heavy metals. That contamination mainly derives from Ihe environmental growth. Theefore, the research on the status of Cd in rhizomes Curcuma aeruginosa Roxb. due phosphate fertilizer is essential to be conducted. The experiment was conducted in the experimental garden of Research Institute for Spice and Medicinal Crops from August 1997 - June 1998. The experiment used polybags which were illed with 25 kg Bogor dry latosol soil mixed with I kg of rice husk and 2 kg cattle manue It used randomized block design (RBD) with four replications and ive samples each treatment. The treatments were (I) no NPK; and 8 dosages of TSP, (2) 0; (3) 2. 5; (4) 5; (5) 7. 5; (6) 10. 0; (7) 12. 5; (8) 15. 0; and (9) 20. 0 g/ polybag respectively. <b>Each</b> <b>TSP</b> treatments was added with 1 5 g uea and 19 g KCI/ polybag. The plant wee harvested at 8. 5 month after planting. The results of experiments showed that application of 2. 5; 5; 7. 5; 10; 12. 5; 15; and 20 g/polybag of TSP increased dry weight of simplicia from 24. 3 - 40 %. The content of Cd in rhizomes, produced by plant with 5 up to 20 g TSP fertilizer was 1. 181 - 2. 756 ppm. The Cd content was higher than tolerance limited value as determined by laws of heavy metal in Japan (I ppm) and WHO (0. 24 ppm). While fertilizer teatments of 0 and 2. 5 g TSP produced rhizomes with Cd content 0. 630 - 0. 945 ppm, and it is still under tolerance limited value by Japan, but, higher than WHO laws. Due to high Cd content in rhizomes (1. 181 - 2. 756 ppm), those simplicia can not be used as row material for medicine...|$|R
