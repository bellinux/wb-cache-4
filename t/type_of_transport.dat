The first part of the trial consisted of the two ships transferring cargo between themselves while anchored in Puget Sound.

2500|$|Most of the {{enzymes that}} perform this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> are transmembrane ATPases. A primary ATPase {{universal}} to all animal {{life is the}} sodium-potassium pump, which helps to maintain the cell potential. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+ [...] ions out of the cell for every two [...] K+ ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light). [...] An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. [...] An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power {{in the form of}} NADPH.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> networks requires public investments, {{in terms}} of government expenditure, on several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> (road, rail, port, airport, and urban public transport) infrastructure, including their operational and maintenance services. This paper develops and implements a system-wide spatioeconomic model to analyze the expenditure competition among different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> investment in the Greek transport sector. The suggested approach can offer valuable insight into the economies of scale and synergies associated with a particular transport investment. It is also extended to consider how such investment determinants as population concentration, economic growth, and political considerations at the prefecture level affect expenditure allocation to different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure. The results indicate the statistical significance of scale effects <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> investment, substitution effects of road investment on other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> investment, and political factors on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> investment. Airport investment relates to the most significant synergistic effects on expenditures in other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> public <b>transport</b> facilities. Thus, policy makers must take these fiscal externalities into account for the strategic planning and evaluation of infrastructure supply, and coordinate or subsidize public transport projects with significant positive externalities. ...|$|R
