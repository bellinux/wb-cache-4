He later engraved Foster's illustrations for Lady of the Lake, and Foster's illustrations for The Poetical Works of George Herbert (1856), printed in Edinburgh. Of the George Herbert engravings he states: [...] "these illustrations I consider <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever engraved". By 1856 Evans had [...] "perfected a process of colour printing from wood blocks", and achieved a reputation as the preeminent wood engraver and best colour printer in London.|$|E
500|$|Holliday's {{favorite}} player {{growing up}} was Cal Ripken, Jr. [...] He {{has stated that}} if he had a dream car it would be a Bentley Continental GT, rather than a sports car, because he is [...] "too big for small sports cars." [...] He is a Christian and is part of a Bible study group with fellow Christian teammates. [...] He has spoken about his faith saying, [...] "I play for God. [...] It says in the Bible that we are to do all things for Him. ... So I try to do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can for Him. [...] This is my job, not who I am."

2500|$|Over {{a period}} of decades, Bartlett has weighed the {{question}} whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book {{was followed by the}} publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: [...] "It is one of the best, if not <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have read on this subject." [...] Similarly, psychologist Hans H. Strupp, who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: [...] "I find myself in substantial agreement with [...] major points which are well stated." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I will," [...] said Dr. Tempest, feeling true {{compassion}} for the unfortunate man whom he saw writhing in agony before him. [...] "It will manifestly be for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should retire. My lord, I wish you good morning. Mrs. Proudie, good morning." [...] And so he left the room.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, David!" [...] he said sorrowfully. [...] "I {{thought that}} you would be pleased with what I had done.

60|$|Meanwhile {{the wine}} {{is merely a}} good wine; <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have tasted better than a Beaujolais, and not unlike. But the trade is poor; it lives from hand to mouth, putting its all into experiments, and forced to sell its vintages.

6000|$|Half our {{artists are}} ruined {{for want of}} education, and by the {{possession}} of knowledge; <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have known have been educated, and illiterate.

In a word, he should be fit for the best society, and should keep out of it.[11] ...|$|E

60|$|The 'Vengeance of the Law' is {{a phrase}} {{not easy to}} forget; but among humane and highly-civilized peoples the word Vengeance should be {{replaced}} by another, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can think of is--Regeneration.

6000|$|... "Done--we {{have done}} nothing. Perhaps we {{have thought the}} more. However, it is all vexation. I am going away to Middleton Abbey, near Shottsford, where a {{relative}} of my late husband lives, who is confined to her bed. The engagement was made in London, and I can't get out of it. Perhaps it is for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> go there till all this is past.

Take this poor consolation with you; it is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can offer now.
