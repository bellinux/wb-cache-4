5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would actuate switches to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|E

500|$|In August 2007, Sanctus Real {{returned}} to the studio to record a fourth album, which was finished {{by the end of}} the year. In November 2007, the album was originally slated for release under the title <b>Turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights,</b> the name of a track on the album. It was later changed to We Need Each Other, and was released in February 2008, through Sparrow Records. The title track [...] "We Need Each Other" [...] was released earlier as the album's lead single in November 2007. The song stayed at number 1 on R's Christian CHR chart for five consecutive weeks by February 2008, and it was 2008's eighth most-played song of the year in the same format.|$|E
500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|With the Ottomans able to bombard {{the port}} and {{shipping}} with observed artillery-fire, Marshall ordered Dunsterforce to leave. Ships had been readied at the docks and evacuation {{took place on}} the night of [...] in two ships. The Dictators changed their minds but behind a rearguard of the 7th North Staffordshire, the men guns and equipment were loaded. A crewmember managed to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of Dunsterville's ship, that was fired on by the port guardship and hit the Armenian six times (the Dunsterforce passengers holding up the crew at gunpoint) as the ships ran for Bandar e-Anzali and arrived with no more casualties. Two Australians who were stranded managed to leave on a refugee ship to Krasnovodsk. With the withdrawal of the British, order broke down among the civilian Azeris, Cossacks and Armenian refugees and as the remaining defences were overrun, fires, pillaging and atrocities began. The Ottoman bombardment continued through the night and by dawn up to [...] many of them civilians, had been killed in reprisal by Azeri irregulars; there had been about [...] casualties. The retreat from Baku left the Dunsterforce troops and Australian wireless operators in Lankaran isolated among an aggrieved public and the force had to repel an attack by Tartar irregulars, before running for Bandar e-Anzali in a stolen lorry on 18 October.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is another}} story about two new {{employees}} wanted to investigate the basement in the Paramount and some old items that had been stored there. The marketing director had offered to take the two new female employees into <b>the</b> basement and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> at <b>the</b> top of the stairs. The ladies hurried down the steps. At that moment the marketing director was called to take a phone call inside the office. He told the other two employees to wait, he would be right back. In their excitement however, they did not hear him and they continued <b>on.</b> Recounting <b>the</b> story later, {{it was at this}} point they called up to him to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next <b>light</b> for them. As it turned out, he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone longer than expected and met the ladies as they were coming back up the steps. [...] "Thanks for <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> for us," [...] one of them is told to have said, [...] "but we can't get it to turn off." [...] Puzzled, the man explained that he had not <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> for them - and in fact, could not <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> They lead him back into the basement, only to be met by darkness.

They drew short, but afterwards deeper, breaths, like bathers entering chill water, separated one from the other, moved about the hall, tiptoed upstairs, raced down, and then Miss M'Leod, and I believe her mother, though she denies this, embraced me. I know M'Leod did.|$|E

60|$|But Harvey, as I {{wrote his}} {{mistress}} {{from time to}} time, throve, and when he grew better, would play by himself grisly games of spying, walking up, hailing, and chasing another dog. From these he would break off of a sudden and return to his normal stiff gait, with the air of one who had forgotten some {{matter of life and}} death, which could be reached only by staring at me. I left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the lawn, and went inside to finish some letters for the post. I must have been at work nearly an hour, for I was going to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> when I felt there was somebody in the room whom, the short hairs {{at the back of my}} neck warned me, I was not in the least anxious to face. There was a mirror on the wall. As I lifted my eyes to it I saw the dog Harvey reflected near the shadow by the closed door. He had reared himself full-length on his hind legs, his head a little one side to clear a sofa between us, and he was looking at me. The face, with its knitted brows and drawn lips, was the face of a dog, but the look, for the fraction of time that I caught it, was human--wholly and horribly human. When the blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor, and was merely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion. Next day I returned him to Miss Sichliffe. I would not have kept him another day for the wealth of Asia, or even Ella Godfrey's approval.|$|E
