5000|$|Early {{centuries of}} kiting {{demonstrated}} that the kite is a rotary engine that rotates its tether part about its mooring point and causes hands and arms to move because of the energy captured from higher winds into the mechanical device. The tension in the lofted devices performs the work of lifting and pulling body parts and things. Airborne wind energy (AWE) for HAWP was birthed thousands of years ago; naming what happened and developing the implied potentials of <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> for doing special works is what is occurring in AWE HAWP.

50|$|Airborne wind {{turbines}} may operate in low or high altitudes; {{they are part}} of a wider class of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) addressed by high-altitude wind power and crosswind kite power. When the generator is on the ground, then the <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> need not carry the generator mass or have a conductive tether. When the generator is aloft, then a conductive tether would be used to transmit energy to the ground or used aloft or beamed to receivers using microwave or laser. Kites and 'helicopters' come down when there is insufficient wind; kytoons and blimps may resolve the matter with other disadvantages. Also, bad weather such as lightning or thunderstorms, could temporarily suspend use of the machines, probably requiring them to be brought back down to the ground and covered. Some schemes require a long power cable and, if the turbine is high enough, a prohibited airspace zone. As of July 2015, no commercial airborne {{wind turbines}} are in regular operation.|$|E
50|$|A kite is an <b>aircraft</b> <b>tethered</b> to a {{fixed point}} {{so that the}} wind blows over its wings. Lift is {{generated}} when air flows over the kite's wing, producing low pressure above the wing and high pressure below it, and deflecting the airflow downwards. This deflection also generates horizontal drag {{in the direction of}} the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of the one or more rope lines or tethers attached to the wing.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{launching}} a <b>tethered</b> rigid <b>aircraft</b> for airborne wind energy generation is investigated. Exploiting well-assessed physical principles, {{an analysis of}} four different take-off approaches is carried out. The approaches are then compared {{on the basis of}} quantitative and qualitative criteria introduced to assess their technical and economic viability. In particular, the additional power required by the take-off functionality is computed and related to the peak mechanical power generated by the system. Moreover, the additionally required on-board mass is estimated, which impacts the cut-in wind speed of the generator. Finally, the approximate ground area required for take-off is also determined. After the theoretical comparison, a deeper study of the concept that is deemed the most viable one, i. e. a linear take-off maneuver combined with on-board propellers, is performed by means of numerical simulations. The simulation results are used to refine the initial analysis and further confirm the viability of the approach...|$|R
5000|$|Ampyx Power is an {{airborne}} {{wind energy}} company founded in 2008 by Bas Lansdorp and Richard Ruiterkamp. It was created after Lansdorp dropped his five-year-long studies of wind energy at Delft University of Technology to found Ampyx Power. In 2011, Lansdorp sold {{a majority of}} his Ampyx Power shares to fund his new project, Mars One. [...] Wubbo Ockels' interest in energy began when he let a kite line slip and it burned his hand. He became interested and started to study and research how this could be turned into electricity. At Delft University, he formed a team with Bas Lansdorp that worked on developing kites that could retrieve energy from the sky. Richard Ruiterkamp became the team leader and he created a fixed wing aircraft that allowed greater controllability and allowing the generation of more energy. In 2008 he founded the company with Bas Lansdorp. Lansdorp worked on the business aspect, and Ruiterkamp {{was head of the}} science division. Currently, Ampyx Power has a team of 40 engineers. Their current prototype is the AP3 Ampyx Power Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES). The system is a <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> that converts wind into electric energy. The aircraft is tethered to an on the ground generator. When the aircraft moves and flies, it reels the tether and powers the generator. The plane is then reeled in through the tether and then re-released into the air.|$|E

40|$|Vertical Takeoff and Landing {{aircraft}} (VTOL) {{have been}} essential {{to our society}} since their introduction in the mid- 1940 s. Today, helicopters are extensively used for military and civilian applications such as search and rescue, police surveillance, oil rig servicing, and cargo transport over short distances. Although helicopters have seen a continuous improvement in performance over the last decades, they still fall short of fixed-wing aircraft in terms of fuel burn. Their limited range is the consequence of the low equivalent lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) in cruise and high empty weight fraction. Also, given {{the large number of}} moving parts and the higher level of vibration, helicopters incur a higher maintenance cost. Recently, Demers Bouchard and Rancourt developed an advanced VTOL concept using three tethered fixed-wing aircraft: the Electric-Powered Reconfigurable Rotor (EPR 2) VTOL Concept. This concept takes advantage of the scale-free characteristics of electric motors and their high power density. The rotor is considered “reconfigurable” since the quasi-circular flight path of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be adapted {{as a function of the}} flight condition. The features of this concept can enable performance enhancement never seen before compared to conventional helicopters. Initial studies of this concept, performed in 2014 and 2015, showed that a payload of one metric ton could be lifted with 60 kWe in hover. However, the capability to evaluate the performance throughout the flight regime was not available. The main research objective of this thesis was to develop a multidisciplinary model for the analysis and performance optimization of the EPR 2 VTOL Concept in hover and with positive flight speed. The novel methodology, based on a two-level of fidelity environment, was used to answer the overarching research question: How can the flexibility in the <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> flight path of the EPR 2 VTOL Concept be used to minimize the power required to fly throughout the flight envelope? Four main contributions are highlighted in this dissertation. First, this work details the development of a multifidelity and multidisciplinary method for the flight path optimization of electric-powered, <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The method detailed in this work is based on a prescribed flight path obtained from a minimal set of parameters P. This approach removes any feedback loop, and therefore, is ideal for a design space exploration. The lower fidelity environment was used to explore the design space and perform direct optimization while the higher fidelity environment is mainly used for analysis. The test cases in this work use the Makani's Wing 7 tethered UAV, initially developed for wind energy harvesting. It was shown that for a total fuselage mass of 800 kg, the power requirement is as low as 42 kWe. At a travel speed of 20 m/s, the power requirement increases to 62 kWe and reaches 95 kWe at 27. 5 m/s. The absolute maximum takeoff weight of the whole system was estimated at 1, 835 kg, with an estimated total empty weight of only 400 kg. This leads to an impressive empty weight ratio of 22 %. The maximum hovering time could be as high as 150 hours (no payload), or 24 hours with a 900 kg payload if powered by jet fuel. Second, a rigid tether model for the flight path optimization of <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> was developed. As an alternative to the full dynamic tether model for the design space exploration phase, a kinematic model was developed to evaluate the approximate tether forces. This model uses the same aerodynamic modeling method than the higher fidelity dynamic model, except that it assumes that the tethers are rigid. The computational time was shown to be on the order of seconds, compared to 20 minutes for the complete dynamic problem with a minimal difference in the accuracy of the results. Third, an improvement to the calculation of the aerodynamic forces on tether segments was developed to minimize the number of required tether segments for this application. An analytical approach was used to demonstrate the benefits of this method versus the standard approach used in the recent literature. Finally, this dissertation details the development of a wake consolidation model for application to fixed-wing aircraft aerodynamics and its integration in a custom-designed free-vortex wake model. This model bridges the gap between conventional helicopter aerodynamic methods and fixed-wing aircraft methods. It considers, the wake interaction between the aircraft and the effect of control surface deflection on the loads and wake. To the author's knowledge, this complete aerodynamic model, which captures all the relevant physics required to analyze <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> is novel and provides a strong foundation for future studies.

50|$|The {{flight testing}} and engine {{development}} received no government funding; the plane's funding came entirely from Hawker.

40|$|A {{control design}} {{approach}} to achieve fully autonomous takeoff and flight maneuvers with a <b>tethered</b> <b>aircraft</b> is presented and demonstrated in real-world flight tests with a small-scale prototype. A ground station {{equipped with a}} controlled winch and a linear motion system accelerates the aircraft to takeoff speed and controls the tether reeling in order to limit the pulling force. This setup corresponds to airborne wind energy (AWE) systems with ground-based energy generation and rigid aircrafts. A simple model of the aircraft's dynamics is introduced and its parameters are identified from experimental data. A model-based, hierarchical feedback controller is then designed, whose aim is to manipulate the elevator, aileron, and propeller inputs in order to stabilize the aircraft during the takeoff and to achieve figure-of-eight flight patterns parallel to the ground. The controller operates in a fully decoupled mode {{with respect to the}} ground station. Parameter tuning and stability/robustness aspect are discussed, too. The experimental results indicate that the controller is able to achieve satisfactory performance and robustness, notwithstanding its simplicity, and confirm that the considered takeoff approach is technically viable and solves the issue of launching this kind of AWE systems in a compact space and at low additional cost...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{autonomous}} launch and landing of a <b>tethered</b> rigid <b>aircraft</b> for airborne wind energy generation is addressed. The system operates with ground-based power conversion and pumping cycles, where the tether is repeatedly reeled {{in and out}} of a winch installed on the ground and linked to an electric motor/generator. In order to accelerate the aircraft to take-off speed, the ground station is augmented with a linear motion system composed by a slide translating on rails and controlled by a second motor. An onboard propeller is used to sustain the forward velocity during the ascend of the aircraft. During landing, a slight tension on the line is kept, while the onboard control surfaces are used to align the aircraft with the rails and to land again on them. A model-based, decentralized control approach is proposed, capable to carry out a full cycle of launch, low-tension flight, and landing again on the rails. The derived controller is tested via numerical simulations with a realistic dynamical model of the system, in presence of different wind speeds and turbulence, and its performance in terms of landing accuracy is assessed. This study is part of a project aimed to experimentally verify the launch and landing approach on a small-scale prototype.

The aim of both experiments focus on the intensive daily observations of atmospheric conditions and the determination of their fundamental meteorological parameters in the vertical column over Lindenberg (Lindenberg's Column). About 20 German research institutions and addition one from the Netherlands, Austria and Russia participated at the experiments. A wide variety of ground-based instruments was operated in Lindenberg and Falkenberg, including LIDARs, microwave radiometer and radiosondes complemented by <b>tethered</b> balloons and <b>aircraft</b> measurements.

40|$|The exhaust from engines {{introduces}} {{zones of}} extreme turbulence levels in local environments around aircraft.

The turbulence distortion will be especially devastating for optical missile warning and laser based DIRCM systems used to protect manoeuvring aircraft against missile attacks, situations where the optical propagation path may {{come close to the}} engine exhaust. To study the extent of the turbulence zones caused by the engine exhaust and the strength of the effects on optical propagation through these zones a joint trial between Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom was performed using a medium sized military turboprop transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>tethered</b> to the ground at an airfield.

Laser beams were propagated along the axis of the aircraft at different distances relative to the engine exhaust and the spatial beam profiles and intensity scintillations were recorded with cameras and photodiodes. A second laser beam path was directed from underneath the loading ramp diagonally past one of the engines. The laser wavelengths used were 1. 5 and 3. 6 m. In addition to spatial beam profile distortions temporal effects were investigated.

40|$|Aviation safety {{regulations}} in Australia and overseas permit the carriage {{of an infant}} passenger on the lap of an adult; however, this practice {{is known to be}} unsafe in an emergency landing scenario. While automotive child restraint systems (CRS) have been found to provide adequate protection to infant passengers, safety issues associated with their use have been identified. Principally, they may interfere with the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft seat, increasing the risk of injury to an adult seated directly behind. This study compared and evaluated the safety of seating arrangements involving infant air transport passengers under emergency landing conditions. Two arrangements were considered: the infant was either held on the lap of an adult or seated in a forward-facing CRS. A partially validated numerical model was used to study seat behaviour and measure injury potential. Results were analysed to compare the safety of different configurations, to evaluate safety in terms of an occupant protection standard and to predict the occurrence and severity of a particular injury using existing biomechanical relationships. One of two practices applies to lap-held infants depending on the jurisdiction a flight is operating under: the infant is either unrestrained or restrained by a supplementary loop belt. This study found that an unrestrained infant is likely to be projected through the aircraft cabin during the impact sequence while a restrained infant is at risk of serious abdominal injuries. Though the adoption of an emergency brace position by an adult carrying a lap-held infant was found to be beneficial, infant injury potential remained high. Of the three brace positions studied, a modified position proposed by this study was the most effective in reducing head injury potential for the infant. Three CRS installation methods - the aircraft seat lap belt, ISOFIX and LATCH - were analysed in terms of CRS performance and behaviour. Each method adequately protected the CRS occupant. The ISOFIX method resulted in a small increase in head injury potential for an adult seated directly aft while in the lap belt and LATCH cases a significant increase was observed. Some airlines specifically prohibit the use of Australian-certified CRS, presumably due to a requirement for installation using a &lsquo;top tether&rsquo; strap. This study found that the use of a top tether does not present any benefit in terms of CRS motion or injury potential for the CRS occupant. This study makes four recommendations: 1. The practice of holding an infant passenger on the lap should be prohibited. Until this is the case, advice on emergency brace positions involving lap-held infants should be revised to include a lateral offset between the head of the infant and that of the adult. 2. The use of automotive child restraints to restrain infant passengers should be mandated. 3. &nbsp;Any requirement for the use of a top <b>tether</b> in <b>aircraft</b> CRS installations should be removed. 4. Child restraint systems should be installed in outboard seats directly forward of a bulkhead, unoccupied space or another CRS...|$|R
40|$|MONTES (“Woodlands”) was a {{multidisciplinary}} international field campaign aimed at measuring energy, water and especially gas exchange between vegetation and atmosphere in a gradient from short semi-desertic shrublands to tall wet temperate forests in NE Spain in the North Western Mediterranean Basin (WMB). The measurements were performed at a semidesertic area (Monegros), at a coastal Mediterranean shrubland area (Garraf), at a typical Mediterranean holm oak forest area (Prades) {{and at a}} wet temperate beech forest (Montseny) during spring (April 2010) under optimal plant physiological conditions in driest-warmest sites and during summer (July 2010) with drought and heat stresses in the driest–warmest sites and optimal conditions in the wettest–coolest site. The objective of this campaign was to study the differences in gas, water and energy exchange occurring at different vegetation coverages and biomasses. Particular attention was devoted to quantitatively understand the exchange of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) because of their biological and environmental effects in the WMB. A wide range of instruments (GC–MS, PTR-MS, meteorological sensors, O 3 monitors,…) and vertical platforms such as masts, <b>tethered</b> balloons and <b>aircraft</b> were used to characterize the gas, water and energy exchange at increasing footprint areas by measuring vertical profiles. In this paper we {{provide an overview of}} the MONTES campaign: the objectives, the characterization of the biomass and gas, water and energy exchange in the 4 sites-areas using satellite data, the estimation of isoprene and monoterpene emissions using MEGAN model, the measurements performed and the first results. The isoprene and monoterpene emission rates estimated with MEGAN and emission factors measured at the foliar level for the dominant species ranged from about 0 to 0. 2 mg m- 2 h- 1 in April. The warmer temperature in July resulted in higher model estimates from about 0 to ca. 1. 6 mg m- 2 h- 1 for isoprene and ca. 4. 5 mg m- 2 h- 1 for monoterpenes, depending on the site vegetation and footprint area considered. There were clear daily and seasonal patterns with higher emission rates and mixing ratios at midday and summer relative to early morning and early spring. There was a significant trend in CO 2 fixation (from 1 to 10 mg C m- 2 d- 1), transpiration (from 1 – 5 kg C m- 2 d- 1), and sensible and latent heat from the warmest–driest to the coolest–wettest site. The results showed the strong land-cover-specific influence on emissions of BVOCs, gas, energy and water exchange, and therefore demonstrate the potential for feed-back to atmospheric chemistry and climat...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from a well-mixed convective boundary layer to a residual layer overlying a stabilized nocturnal layer raises several issues, which remain difficult to address from both modeling and observational perspectives. The well mixed convective boundary layer is mainly forced by buoyancy, with fully developed turbulence. The daily decrease of the surface buoyancy flux leads to the decay of the turbulence kinetic energy, and a possible change {{of the structure of}} the turbulence before it reaches the stable regime, with more anisotropy and intermittency. It is important to better understand these processes, as it can impact on the dispersion of tracers in the atmosphere, and on the development of the nocturnal and daytime boundary layers of the following days. The turbulence decay has been studied with laboratory experiments (Monin and Yaglom, 1975, Cole and Fernando 1998), numerical studies (Nieuwstadt and Brost 1986, Sorbjan 1997) and observations (Fitzarrald et al 2004, Grant 1997). The decay is related to the decrease of the surface buoyancy flux, but with complexity gained with shear-driven boundary layers (Pino et al 2006, Goulart et al 2003), which slow the decay. The evolution of the structure of turbulence during its decay remains unclear, with results on the evolution of characteristic scales that vary with the considered approaches and conditions. An observational and numerical study is proposed to address this related issue, based on the BLLAST (Boundary Layer Late Afternoon and Sunset Turbulence) dataset. BLLAST aims at better understanding the turbulent processes of the late afternoon transition, and leans on a field experiment that took place in summer 2011 in South-West France. A well-documented cloud-free weak wind day is considered here to analyze in details the evolution of the turbulence along the day, from midday to sunset. In particular, the decay is studied as a function of height, and the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy is described with a thorough analysis of the turbulence spectra. The case study combines observations of the mean structure by radiosondes and remote sensing, and observations of the turbulence with surface stations, <b>tethered</b> balloon and <b>aircraft.</b> It is the base of a complementary idealized numerical study with a large eddy simulation. From both observations and numerical simulations, the turbulence is described with the characteristics of the spectral energy density, especially the typical turbulence lengthscales and the sharpness of the {{transition from}} energy-containing eddies to the inertial subrange. An analytical model proposed by Kristensen and Lenschow (1988) for homogeneous non-isotropic turbulence is used to approximate the observed and LES-modeled spectra and estimate their characteristics. Our analysis enables us to (1) test the capability of the large eddy simulation to represent the turbulence structure of the afternoon decay, (2) evaluate the evolution of integral scales, turbulent kinetic energy, shape of the spectra in both observations and numerical simulation, and as a function of height, (3) further understand the potential decoupling with height that occurs when the surface fluxes get too weak to maintain fully developed turbulence within the entire depth of the convective boundary layer, (4) put into evidence the limitations of the spectral approach for this critical period of the planetary boundary layer diurnal cycle.
