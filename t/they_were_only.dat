The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured {{over a hundred}} former slaves before disengaging {{in the face of}} Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.|$|E
5|$|All {{three of}} the ships in Toulon were placed in reserve {{and two of them}} were {{captured}} virtually intact when the Germans attempted to seize the French fleet in November 1942. They were turned over to the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina), but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> used for transport missions before the Italy surrendered in September 1943.

5|$|An early {{criticism}} of the SmarTrip cards had been that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC-area locations {{in an effort to}} increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the second World War in 1941, the Oval – {{including}} terraces, offices, kits and club records – was destroyed in a bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs, most notably Cliftonville. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> victorious over Linfield on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, {{the three}} major South American navies found {{themselves}} unable to acquire major warships; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> {{able to do so}} again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than s and s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> able to acquire them when the Red Scare began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951. While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be treaty-bound to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).|$|E

This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley, having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster. He learned {{that he would not}} receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006, which was partly because both Chris McCann and Kyle Lafferty had both already received professional contracts and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> second year apprentices.|$|E
