As a result, residential loads during spring and autumn can usually be treated as base loads which are rarely influenced by <b>temperature</b> <b>factors</b> [29, 30, 31, 32]. Table  1 also shows that, the residential peak loads are most correlated with the daily maximum temperature on days in summer and winter.

For ventilation controlled fires, critical fuel surface area per unit internal surface area of room corresponds with <b>temperature</b> <b>factor.</b> As the flashover time is smaller, the critical heat release rate for flashover is increased.
