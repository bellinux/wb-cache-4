50|$|Towards {{the late}} 19th century, it {{appeared}} {{clear that the}} traditional education system in Luxembourg was no longer fit to serve the new society as it was since the Industrial Revolution.

Through a far-reaching reform of the education system, Eyschen's government attempted to respond to these changes in society.

30|$|The {{treatment}} {{effects that}} are reported for higher occupations {{are sensitive to}} both gender and the occupational categorisation that is considered. In terms of gender, the estimated treatment effects for women are approximately {{twice as large as}} for men and are almost all statistically significant at the 95 % confidence interval (in contrast to the estimates for men). Furthermore, expanding the definition of higher occupations to include “technical and trades” together with managers and professionals (not reported here) produces treatment effects that are highly significant and of comparable magnitudes to the effects reported for employment rates. This sensitivity to the inclusion of <b>technical</b> and trades <b>occupations</b> is to be expected given the statistics reported in Table  1. Table  1 indicates that the proportion of Family Stream migrants employed in <b>technical</b> and trades <b>occupations</b> fell by 2 percentage points between 2005 and 2009, whereas it increased by 7 percentage points for GSMs and increased by 6 percentage points for Employer Sponsored migrants.|$|R
