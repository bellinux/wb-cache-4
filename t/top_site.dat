The town centre offers high street shopping, a regular market by the Grade I listed old town hall, central library, {{head post office}} and sorting office, museum & art gallery, bus/Metro interchange, town hall and civic offices. The Customs House is located within the historic Mill Dam conservation area and hosts a theatre, cinema, art gallery and restaurant. Arbeia formed the easternmost extremity of the Roman Empire at Hadrian's Wall and {{is located at the}} mouth of the River Tyne on the North Sea coast.

2500|$|It is internationally {{recognised}} {{that the}} United Kingdom {{has a higher}} incidence of tornadoes, measured by unit area of land, than {{any other country in the}} world. Dr T. Theodore Fujita (inventor of the Fujita scale), an American meteorologist, was the first to recognise the UK as the <b>top</b> <b>site</b> for tornadoes in 1973. The United Kingdom has at least 33 tornadoes per year, more than any other country in the world relative to its land area. Although most tornadoes are weak, there are occasional destructive events, for example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006. [...] Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury. The largest ever recorded was thought to have been an F4, again in London in 1091. The most deadly occurred on 28 December 1879. All 74 lives were lost when a passenger train plunged from the Tay Bridge (Tayside) into the Tay Estuary, when the middle section of the bridge collapsed. Although the bridge was poorly constructed and had already been weakened in earlier gales (including the pre-existing winds at the time of the tragedy), the ultimate failure is believed to have been caused by two or three waterspouts which were sighted close to the bridge immediately before the accident. A tornado also developed in London on 3 July 2007.|$|E

40|$|A kinetic lattice gas {{model is}} used to study the {{equilibrium}} properties and the desorption kinetics of CO on Ru(0001). The authors compute all relevant on-site binding and interaction energies of CO molecules within density functional theory and import them in two different models. The first model allows the CO molecules to adsorb upright on <b>top</b> and hollow <b>sites.</b> The authors calculate the phase diagram, coverage isobars, and temperature programed desorption spectra. Up to a coverage of 1 / 3 ML, very good agreement is obtained between theory and experiment when considering <b>top</b> <b>sites</b> only. For coverages beyond 1 / 3 ML, hollow sites are included and disagreement between theory and experiment occurs. The second model allows adsorption on <b>top</b> <b>sites</b> only but allows them to tilt and shift from their upright positions. The authors show that this model resolves many of the deficiencies of their first one. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that this model is more consistent with experiment {{since it is the}} only model that is able to explain the results from IR-spectroscopy experiments.

To ensure fair ratings, participants were unaware of the ratings assigned by the search engines, or even that search engines had generated the sites. Individual difference characteristics of the raters (e. g., browser-searcher, level of knowledge and interest in topic) were also collected. Agreement as to the <b>top</b> <b>sites</b> was quite low among search engines. However, people showed very high levels of agreement and reliability. Search engines' ratings did not correspond well with the raters' ratings. Nevertheless, Infoseek performed better than HotBot on every measure of agreement with user ratings...|$|R
