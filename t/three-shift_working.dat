But by 1940 Greenside Mine had become the largest producer of lead ore in the United Kingdom. Over 220 people were employed at the mine in 1941, when production peaked at over 5,000 tons of lead per year. However, this did not immediately translate into profits because of high development costs, and operating losses continued to be made until 1941 ...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation means {{accommodation}} {{of a living}} organism to constantly changing conditions external and internal environments. This capacity {{was developed in the}} process of the evolutionary development. Absent of this capacity, no human organism can leave normally or adjust to various external factors. In the contemporary research literature, adaptation is associated with different factors, including occupation, climate, social environment, etc. The process of adaptation is complex, and it contemplates different types of adaptation, namely, individual sociopsychological, communicative, and physiological adaptation. It is accompanied by substantial intellectual, mental and physical efforts. The variety of building structures coupled with process-related and organizational methods of their construction require attention to the issues of safety. In the course of life and work (working environment), a person is exposed to various hazards or phenomena, processes, and objects capable of damaging human health under certain conditions. An occupational hazard means an adverse impact on human health in the form of its deterioration or injury under certain conditions. The studies show that the <b>three-shift</b> <b>working</b> activity is the cause of fatigue. Fatigue boosts errors in the sensomotor coordination and deteriorates human health. The daily rhythm of physiological functions is driven by the intensity of the working activity causing changes in the body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. Harmful factors, such as chlorine and chlorine dioxide, produce negative impact on the psycho-physiological status of the organism. They are countered by the system of adaptation and rehabilitation {{as an integral part of}} the university curriculum. Its objective is to enhance the effectiveness of professional activities, to ensure the optimal functioning of a human body exposed to heavy workloads and adverse external conditions.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{prevalence}} of Shift Work Disorder (SWD) {{in a sample of}} nurses, and the association between SWD and work characteristics, health outcome and personality (paper 1) have been investigated. Next, the psychometric properties of the “Bergen Shift Work Sleep Questionnaire” (BSWSQ) were evaluated (paper 2). The BSWSQ evaluates sleep and sleepiness problems in relation to day shifts, evening shifts, night shifts and rest-days. The validated BSWSQ was used to investigate how different work shifts and work schedules affected problems with sleep and sleepiness (paper 3). In paper 1, three symptom-based questions were used to assess {{the prevalence}} of symptoms indicative of SWD. To evaluate the accuracy of these questions, two additional measurement procedures were used for comparison. All three procedures were based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD- 2) diagnostic criteria that entail the presence of a sleep or sleepiness problem associated with a work schedule that imposes wakefulness during the usual time for sleep (American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), 2005). Logistic regression analyses were performed with symptoms indicative of SWD as outcome variables. Nurses (n = 1968) reported their age, gender, type of work schedule, commute duration, fraction of a full-time position, presence of children in household (yes/no), number of nights and number of shifts separated by less than 11 hours worked during the previous year, use of sleep medication, melatonin and bright light therapy. All of the nurses completed the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Global Sleep Assessment Questionnaire, the Diurnal Scale, the Revised Circadian Type Inventory, the Dispositional Resilience (Hardiness) Scale – Revised, the Fatigue Questionnaire, questions about alcohol and caffeine consumption, as well as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The SWD prevalence varied among nurses depending on assessment procedure (32. 4 – 37. 6 %) and on type of work schedule (4. 8 – 44. 3 %). SWD symptoms were reported among over one third of the nurses in the study sample with greater prevalence among those working night shifts and/or rotating shifts. Risk of SWD significantly increased with older age, higher languidity scores (circadian type), night work, more shifts worked in the previous year separated by less than 11 hours, more nights worked during the previous year, and with higher insomnia and anxiety scores. High scores of the circadian type of flexibility and being a female were associated with reduced risk of SWD. The three different SWD-assessment procedures provided similar results. The three symptom-based questions were considered adequate at assessing symptoms indicative of SWD for the purposes of epidemiological investigation. Paper 2 investigated the psychometric properties of the BSWSQ among 760 nurses <b>working</b> <b>three-shift</b> rotation schedules. The BSWSQ assesses seven symptoms including: > 30 min sleep onset latency, > 30 min wake after sleep onset, > 30 min premature awakenings, non-restorative sleep, being sleepy either at work, during free periods on work days, or on rest-days. The factor structure was investigated using structural equation modeling (SEM) and the test-retest reliability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients. Pearson-product moment correlation coefficients were calculated to test the convergent/divergent validity between the BSWSQ and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Differences in insomnia symptom mean scores with respect to different shifts and rest-days were also investigated. BSWSQ demonstrated an adequate model fit using SEM, good test-retest reliability and good convergent/discriminant validity. Post hoc comparisons showed that working night shifts predicted higher overall/composite scores on the BSWSQ compared to day and evening shifts and rest-days. The BSWSQ was concluded to meet necessary psychometric standards and to successfully assess variations in sleep and sleepiness problems by type of shifts and rest-days. In paper 3, shift-related sleep and sleepiness problems among nurses working different work schedules were studied using the BSWSQ. To assess the severity of the sleep and sleepiness problems, shift-related insomnia was defined as often/always experiencing sleep and sleepiness problems (separately for rest days and day, evening and night shifts). Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between shift-related insomnia (during day, evening and night shifts) and type of work schedule (i. e., permanent as opposed to rotational schedules). There were no differences between the work schedules in prevalence of day shift insomnia. Evening shift insomnia was more prevalent in two-shift (29. 8 %) compared to threeshift rotations (19. 8 %). Night shift insomnia was more common among three-shift rotation workers (67. 7 %) than among permanent night workers (41. 7 %). Rest-day insomnia was more prevalent among permanent night workers (11. 4 %) compared to workers with two- (4. 2 %) and three-shift rotations (3. 6 %). In paper 3, it was concluded that shift-related insomnia is most prevalent among nurses <b>working</b> <b>three-shift</b> rotations and night shifts. Nevertheless, sleep and sleepiness problems were present among nurses during all types of shifts and with all types of work schedules. </p...|$|R

Syftet var vidare att se om skillnader förelåg i arbetstillfredsställelsen mellan intensivvårdssjuksköterskor som arbetade treskift och som inte arbetade treskift. Studien var deskriptiv med kvantitativ ansats. Sextiofyra sjuksköterskor deltog och bortfallet var 29 %. Enkäter testade gällande validitet och reliabilitet för arbetstillfredsställelse användes i studien. Arbetstillfredsställelsen var genomgående hög, intensivvårdssjuksköterskorna upplevde sig mötas med respekt av överordnade och samarbetsklimatet var bra. De var en del av ett team, arbetet var intressant och autonomin var hög. Majoriteten upplevde att personaltätheten var otillräcklig för arbetsbelastningen, beslut från överordnade gick inte att påverka och nästan en tredjedel upplevde sig inte få beröm vid bra utfört arbete. Trots genomgående hög arbetstillfredsställelse funderade nästan tjugo procent på att byta jobb. Senaste året hade arbetsbördan ökat med mer administrativt arbete och mindre tid för patientvård. Förtroendet för den offentliga sjukvården hade minskat. Inga signifikanta skillnader fanns gällande arbetstillfredsställelsen mellan intensivvårdssjuksköterskor som arbetade treskift och som inte arbetade treskift. Nattarbetet ansågs behöva värderas högre med mer tid för återhämtning. Konklusion: Arbetstillfredsställelsen var genomgående hög men arbetsbördan hade ökat senaste året, utbrett missnöje förekom gällande återhämtningstiden vid nattarbete. The {{objectives}} were {{to describe the}} work satisfaction amongst intensive care nurses, and to investigate if the work situation {{has changed over the}} last year. A further purpose was to see if there were any differences in the work satisfaction between intensive care nurses who worked three-shift {{and those who did not}}. The study was descriptive with a quantitative approach. Sixty-four nurses participated and the 29  percent decided not to participate. Questionnaires tested regarding validity and reliability for work satisfaction were used in the study. Work satisfaction was overall high; the intensive care nurses perceived themselves as being respected by superiors, and the work situation as good. They felt part of a team; the work was interesting and the levels of autonomy high. The majority perceived that the staffing levels were insufficient for the workload, they could not affect the decisions made by their superiors, and almost a third experienced that they do not get praise for work well done. Despite the overall high work satisfaction almost twenty percent were thinking of changing jobs. During the last year, the workload had increased with more administrative work leaving less time for patient care. The trust in public healthcare had decreased. No significant differences were found regarding the work satisfaction between intensive care nurses <b>working</b> <b>three-shift</b> and those who did not work three-shift. The general opinion was that night work needed to be valued higher, and that more time was needed for recovery. Conclusion: The work satisfaction was overall high, but the workload had increased over the last year, and there was a widespread dissatisfaction regarding recovery time after night work. ...|$|R
