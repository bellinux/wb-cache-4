For example, in {{a study published in}} 1994, subjects were initially shown one of two different series of slides that depicted a college student at the university bookstore, with different objects of the same type changed in some slides. One version of the slides would, for example, show a screwdriver while the other would show a wrench, and the audio narrative accompanying the slides would only refer to the object as a [...] "tool". In the second phase, subjects would read a narrative description of the events in the slides, except this time a specific tool was named, which would be the incorrect tool half the time. Finally, in the third phase, subjects had to list five examples of specific types of objects, such as tools, but were told to only list examples which they had not seen in the slides. Subjects who had read an incorrect narrative were far less likely to list the written object (which they hadn't actually seen) <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> (28% vs. 43%), and were far more likely to incorrectly list the item which they had actually seen (33% vs. 26%).|$|E

40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injury {{continues to be}} a constant adversary to field sports athletes. Females are widely acknowledged as being at an increased risk of ACL injury, in comparison to males. Athletes who are successful in rehabilitation after surgery and return to their sport are reported to have an increased risk of repeated ACL injury and the development of osteoarthritis. The current thesis utilised a novel, maximal drop-jump land and unanticipated cutting task to assess the lower limb biomechanics of uninjured male and females, and previously ACL injured subjects (ACLr). Discrete measures of lower limb kinematics and kinetics were firstly compared between uninjured males and females, and secondly between the previously injured (PI) leg of ACLr subjects and both the contralateral non-injured (NI) leg and an uninjured <b>subject’s</b> <b>control</b> leg. <b>The</b> results show that females had increased hip internal rotation, the PI leg was not significantly different to the NI leg but was different to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg with increased hip flexion, internal knee abduction moment and transverse plane knee ROM. Lower limb coordination was assessed in the ACLr subjects and both legs of the ACLr subjects had similar coordination patterns. The PI leg however showed different coordination patterns <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg for a number of couplings. Movement and coordination variability were also utilised for a gender and ACLr – <b>control</b> comparison. <b>The</b> female <b>subjects</b> and the PI leg had lower levels of movement and coordination variability <b>than</b> males and <b>the</b> contralateral non-injured leg respectively. The PI leg however, had higher levels of movement and coordination variability <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg. In conclusion, females and previously ACL injured subjects may be at an increased risk of initial ACL injury and the development of osteoarthritis on the PI leg respectively, due to lower levels of movement and coordination variability. Altered biomechanics at the hip were also highlighted as a potential mechanism increasing injury risk in females and ACLr subjects...|$|R

Hemostatic function compared in NVAF patients without prior embolic event (transient ischemic attack or embolic stroke) and control subjects without prior thrombotic stroke, and in NVAF patients with prior embolic event and control subjects with prior thrombotic stroke. SETTING: Internal medicine outpatient group practice and anticoagulation clinic in 2 teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 75 NVAF patients (50 without and 25 with prior embolic event) and 42 control patients (31 without and 11 with prior thrombotic stroke) recruited concurrently over 18 months during 1990 - 91. OUTCOME MEASURES: Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), {{partial thromboplastin time}} (PTT), and plasma levels of hemoglobin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen, factor VIII, fibrin D-dimer, antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, fibrinopeptide A and prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2.

The patients' mean homocysteine levels were 40. 6 ± 9. 6 μmol/L on the 2 nd day, 21. 7 ± 11. 1 μmol/L on the 5 th day, and 20. 7 ± 9. 2 μmol/L on the 10 th day. The mean homocysteine level of the control subjects was 11. 2 ± 1. 1 μmol/L. The homocysteine levels of the patients were higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> at all times (P <. 01). In conclusion, patients with stroke have a higher circulating serum hsCRP and homocysteine levels. Short-term unfavorable prognosis seems to be associated with elevated serum hsCRP levels in patients with stroke. Although serum homocysteine was found to be higher, homocysteine seems not related to prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Chemical, occupational, {{and other}} {{exposures}} as {{risk factors for}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) among homosexual men are reported from a population-based case-control study of 1593 eligible subjects with NHL and 2515 control subjects conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1988 and 1995. Results are presented for 312 homosexual men with NHL and 420 homosexual control subjects. HIV-positive patients were less likely than control subjects to have worked in technical, sales, and administrative occupations; service occupations; and precision production, craft, or repair-related occupations. They were likely to have had less exposure to petroleum products, aldehydes, cleaning solvents, adhesives, insecticides, welding fumes, and tar, pitch, soot, or ash. The HIV-negative patients were less likely <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> to have worked in managerial or professional specialty occupations and in technical, sales, or administrative occupations. HIV-negative patients were somewhat more likely than control subjects to {{have been exposed to}} herbicides (OR = 2. 0, CI = 0. 89 to 4. 7), to radioactivity (OR = 4. 7, CT = 1. 7 to 13), and to tar, soot, pitch, or ash (250 + hours: OR = 2. 3, CI = 0. 96 to 5. 6). HIV-negative NHL patients also were somewhat more likely to have lived on a farm as children <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> (OR = 2. 4, CI = 1. 0 to 5. 6). Pooled over HIV status, patients were somewhat more likely to have worked as motor vehicle or rail operators for more than 1 year (OR = 2. 1, CI = 0. 98 to 4. 4). Most occupational exposures were of brief duration and many chemical exposures were reported as minimal. No clear and strong associations were found, although the risk for NHL related to exposure to several chemicals generally was reduced among HIV-positive men and elevated among HIV-negative men...|$|E
30|$|Patients with COPD or BA showed higher {{prevalence}} of respiratory symptoms <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> in each month. For HR-QoL, all subscales worsened in the patients {{than in the}} control group in March. Although the HR-QoL of the COPD and control groups were not significantly changed through the surveys, some subscales of the BA group showed remarkable improvement in July as compared to March. Daily means of PM 2.5 in March were significantly higher than those in July. Carbon and ionic component concentrations, except for magnesium and calcium ions, were significantly higher in March than July. Mass concentrations of some metallic components were also significantly higher in March than July. The percentage of nitrate ion in PM 2.5 was significantly higher in March when compared to that in July.|$|E
40|$|Before the {{completion}} of visual development, visual deprivation impairs synaptic elimination in the visual cortex. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is also altered in the visual cortex in subjects with early-onset blindness. Positron emission tomography was carried out with [(15) O]water and [(11) C]flumazenil on six blind subjects and seven sighted controls at rest. We found that the CBF was significantly higher in the visual cortex for the early-onset blind <b>subjects</b> <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> sighted <b>control</b> <b>subjects.</b> However, there was no significant difference in the BZR distribution in the visual cortex for the subject with early-onset blindness <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> sighted <b>control</b> <b>subjects.</b> These results demonstrated that early visual deprivation does not affect the distribution of GABA(A) receptors in the visual cortex with the sensitivity of our measurements. Synaptic elimination may be independent of visual experience in the GABAergic system of the human visual cortex during visual development...|$|R
40|$|Background: A high-fat diet {{has been}} {{recommended}} for correction of biochemical abnormalities and muscle energy state {{in patients with}} complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) deficiency (CID). Objective: This study evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of isoenergetic amounts of triacylglycerol or glucose on substrate oxidation, glycolytic carbohydrate metabolism, and energy state in patients with CID. Design: Four CID patients and 15 matched <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> were infused with triacylglycerol (1. 85 mg(.) kg(- 1.) min(- 1)) or glucose (5 mg(.) kg(- 1.) min(- 1)) while at rest. Respiratory calorimetry {{was used to evaluate}} mitochondrial substrate oxidation. Metabolism of glycolytic carbohydrate was determined {{on the basis of the}} rates of appearance and concentrations of plasma lactate from dilution of [1 -C- 13]lactate measurements. In addition, high-energy phosphate metabolism was measured in forearm muscle by P- 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: Whole-body oxygen consumption rates were higher in <b>the</b> patients <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> (P < 0. 05). Oxygen consumption and hi. -h-energy phosphate metabolism in forearm muscle were not significantly different between the 2 infusion groups. The rates of appearance and concentrations of plasma lactate were higher in each of <b>the</b> 4 patients <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> (P < 0. 05) and were lower during <b>the</b> triacylglycerol infusion <b>than</b> during <b>the</b> glucose infusion (P < 0. 05); the differences were comparable in <b>the</b> patients and <b>control</b> <b>subjects.</b> Conclusions: We conclude that triacylglycerol infusion, relative to glucose infusion, does not improve the oxidation of substrates or the energy state of skeletal muscle and does not lower the rates of appearance and concentrations of plasma lactate to normal values in CID patients at rest...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} whether patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) make movements that are of smaller amplitude when required to attend to a secondary task {{at the same time}} as performing a motor task. Methods: Thirteen patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s dis-ease (mean age, 67. 1 yrs) and 14 healthy <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> (mean age, 66. 2 yrs) were tested. The motor task was repeated oppo-sition of the thumb and forefinger and the secondary task was a lexical decision task. Results: The PD patients made hypometric movements, and the amplitude was further decreased when they performed the secondary task at the same time. There was no significant change for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> unpaced motor task was less automatic for <b>the</b> PD patients <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects,</b> and hence mor...|$|R
