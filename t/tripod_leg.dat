50|$|The tripod mount, {{designed}} by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969 and weighs 4.5 kg. It is a lighter mount for the PK(M) general-purpose machine gun without affecting {{the accuracy of}} fire. Besides, the Stepanov mount has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod and is 40% less labour-intensive.The Stepanov mount {{is based on a}} principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod: the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism frame lock for anti-aircraft fire; the fine elevation adjustment mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear <b>tripod</b> <b>leg.</b> This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning the gun.|$|E
5000|$|Coincidentally or not, Anna Massey played {{important}} roles in both Peeping Tom and Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972). In the former her Helen character was Lewis's almost-normal love interest, who almost brought redemption to him. Helen herself {{was working on a}} photography-themed children's book, and for a while it looked like helping her on this project might divert Lewis from his own perverse documentary film. In Frenzy, which is unusual for later Hitchcock in its working-class London street settings, Miss Massey plays a barmaid, Babs Milligan, sympathetic to the main suspect, Richard Blaney (played by Jon Finch), who had worked with her. Blaney is abetted by Babs in his eluding the police, and they have sex while on the run, but she herself is murdered before they can get Blaney cleared. Significantly, the Frenzy murderer, Robert Rusk (Barry Foster), might have been be able to perform sexually only while enjoying the [...] "lovely, lovely" [...] look of terror on his victims' faces while he was strangling them. Much of Lewis's project in Peeping Tom was to capture fully the face of fear on his victims, which he provoked by coming closer and closer, with handheld camera rolling, and revealing {{that he was about to}} kill them with a sharpened <b>tripod</b> <b>leg.</b> To enhance their terror, he had a mirror mounted on the camera so that they too could see their own fear, just as he stabbed them in the neck with the tripod. (This seemed almost to sexually excite and sate him, though he did not penetrate them beyond this symbolic act.) ...|$|E

40|$|The fixture used to {{hold the}} IH module while the EC Calorimeter is pul led over it {{consists}} of two tripod frames with a double wide flange between them. The two tripods have legs made of 6 -inch Schedule 40 pipe, these legs are tied together with 2 -inch Schedule 40 pipe. One of the legs sits on and {{is attached to a}} box made of 3 / 4 -inch plates. The fixture was analyzed using ANSYS. The element used was a 3 -D beam (STIF 4). Equivalent properties were figured for the double wide flange. The legs of the tripods were constrained in the Y direction (vertical). The box {{at the bottom of the}} <b>tripod</b> <b>leg</b> was not used in this analysis, the leg was constrained at the point of attachment to the box. The cross beam was loaded at two points representing the IH load. The reaction force at the point where the <b>tripod</b> <b>leg</b> attaches to the box was then used in an analysis of the box itself. The box was modeled using plate elements (STIF 63). The bottom of the box was constrained in the Y (vertical) direction. The top of the box was loaded in roughly a circular area to represent the pipe attachment area. The reaction force from the previous analysis was divided among these nodes...|$|E

40|$|Mobility and {{kinematics}} of {{a folding}} cube are introduced. This cube {{is shown to}} be an array of 12 parallel, symmetric 1 -dof 4 -bar linkages. The cube is composed of 8 corner tripods and 12 edge rods. There is a hinge {{at the end of}} each edge rod connected to an adjacent corner <b>tripod</b> <b>leg.</b> Motion is obtained by each tripod screwing inward about an axis along the cube space diagonal. Two different foldings are described by adjacent tripods screwing in the same, isorotation, or in the opposite, counter-rotation, hand. Folding motion and direct and inverse kinematics are derived. Results are easily obtained in closed form not only for the folding cube but also for the underlying general four-bar kernel mechanism where crank and follower are of different radii and axes are skewed. Singularity and joint combinations analyses are presented along with other angular relationships among mechanism components. The folding cube can be adapted as a robotic manipulator component which promises to be stiff, light and simple. This component mechanism appears to be a member of a family of similar, parallel mechanisms where the 4 -bar kernel axes are coplanar. Family architecture appears to be based on the 5 platonic solids. The folding rectangle and the folding tetrahedron are introduced as two members of the family...|$|E

50|$|The tribrach is {{attached}} to the tripod and placed over the monument. Looking through the optical plummet pick up two of the <b>tripod</b> <b>legs</b> and position the cross hairs over the monument. Tread all three legs into the grass, bitumen, concrete. Look through the optical plummet and using the thumbscrews put the cross hairs back over the monument. Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the tripod screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the cross hairs using the thumb screws, then fine-tune the level using the <b>tripod</b> <b>legs.</b> Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the monument, level the tribrach the last little bit using the thumbscrews. Slacken the tribrach from the tripod head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the monument and level. If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable. However, if there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the tripod feet, such as when the target is in a deep hole or raised on a shelf or wall, it will not work, as the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the optical plummet as the <b>tripod</b> <b>legs</b> are raised or lowered.|$|R

50|$|In photography, {{a tripod}} {{is used to}} {{stabilize}} and elevate a camera, a flash unit, or other photographic equipment.

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century the demand for {{campaign}} furniture encouraged many makers to be inventive in their design thus creating many unusual and interesting pieces that offer a surprise in the ease in which they dismantle or the compactness of their storage. Tables were cleverly hinged to fold down into a box {{the size of a}} briefcase, chess board boxes would contain <b>tripod</b> <b>legs</b> and a telescopic column to convert into a table; chairs that would break down to a minimal size and could also be altered to become a sedan were all designed.

50|$|A travel tripod is {{one that}} has been {{designed}} to fit certain criteria including lightness and rigidity to give the photographer the freedom to travel and carry his/her tripod for extended periods. It must be small and light enough to be carried as hand baggage yet has enough strength to support a professional DSLR and fast telephoto lens. Typical specifications for a travel <b>tripod</b> <b>legs</b> would be: Weight (without head): 2 to 4 lbs (0.9 to 1.8 kg), Height (contracted): 12 to 20 inches (30 to 50cm), Height (extended): - 60 to 70 inches (152 to 178cm) and Max Load: 5 to 10 lbs (2.3 to 4.6 kg). Typical prices for a good quality travel tripod would be: Aluminum: $150-300 (without head) and Carbon Fiber: $250-500 (without head).|$|R
50|$|The base mount is the {{connection}} between the tripod head and the <b>tripod</b> <b>legs.</b> Often the head will have a fairly large, flat base that sits on top of the tripod, and uses cork or rubber to increase the friction between the two, to prevent the head from unscrewing during use. The actual connection between the two is often made with a screw. A common standard for base mounts on photographic tripod equipment is a 3/8-16 screw on the tripod (a screw that is 3/8 inches in diameter, with 16 threads per inch) and a matching receptacle on the tripod head. Tripods intended for smaller photographic equipment that {{do not need to be}} as rugged (such as point and shoot cameras or smartphones) use a smaller 1/4-20 screw.|$|R
