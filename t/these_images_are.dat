The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two.|$|E
5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though <b>these</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, who sits on his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. <b>These</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the veneration of household Niños Dios during the Christmas season, {{there are a number}} of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Niños Dios often have a special place in the worship by Mexican Catholics, but sometimes they have been the objects of “kidnapping” and disputes. Most of the best-known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico. Offerings to <b>these</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times.|$|E
25|$|Although {{bronze casting}} {{has a long}} history in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures in all sizes ranging from massive to {{miniature}} were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. It should be noted that when in worship, <b>these</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> bedecked in silk costumes, garlands, and gem encrusted jewels, befitting the particular avatar and religious context. Decorating temple bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old and such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|Bishop's {{contributions}} to photography were also lasting. When he {{first arrived in}} China in 1915, {{he set out to}} record sites of interest in Peking, and succeeded in photographing most of them. His photographs of imperial sites now stand as almost unique parts of the documentary record. Bishop also used his spare time to photograph street life and social customs, architecture (especially historic buildings), and scenery. These photographs, which Bishop classified with his own system and annotated with extensive notes, were not put on display, but mounted in twelve notebooks, though the negatives were kept in storage at the Smithsonian. Some 4,000 of <b>these</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> included in the Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Brill Publishers microform edition.|$|E
25|$|At sunset Ra {{passes through}} the akhet, the horizon, in the west. At times the horizon is {{described}} as a gate or door that leads to the Duat. At others, the sky goddess Nut is said to swallow the sun god, so that his journey through the Duat is likened to a journey through her body. In funerary texts, the Duat and the deities in it are portrayed in elaborate, detailed, and widely varying imagery. <b>These</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> symbolic of the awesome and enigmatic nature of the Duat, where both the gods and the dead are renewed by contact with the original powers of creation. Indeed, although Egyptian texts avoid saying it explicitly, Ra's entry into the Duat is seen as his death.|$|E
25|$|The templon {{began to}} change forms to the medieval templon with the {{attachment}} of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of <b>these</b> <b>images</b> <b>are</b> from the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the Deesis (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of Lazarus, linking the scene of Lazarus with the Holy Week images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style {{is representative of the}} increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.|$|E
