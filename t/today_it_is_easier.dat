50|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} issues of the Zainichi community is the rate of assimilation of Zainichi into Japan. About 9,000 to 11,000 Koreans naturalize in Japan every year out of slightly less than 600,000.One crucial aspect of naturalisation for Zainichi Korean is that both Mindan and Chongryon link Korean ethnic identity to Korean nationality (Japanese and South Korean nationality laws do not allow multiple citizenship for adults). By their definition, opting for a Japanese passport means becoming a Japanese, rather than a Korean Japanese. In order to be naturalized as Japanese citizens, Zainichi Koreans {{had to go through}} multiple, complex steps. In order for Zainichi Koreans to complete these steps, they were required to collect information about their family and ancestors that stretched ten generations. They could collect this information if they paid money to an organization such as Mindan, however with prohibitively expensive cost, so many were unable to afford such information. However, these processes became much easier as time passed and <b>today,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> for Zainichi Koreans to naturalize into Japanese citizens. Though there are a few cases of celebrities who naturalize with their Korean name, the majority of Zainichi Koreans formally choose a name that is both read and appears ethnically Japanese. This means that the rate of naturalisation can be taken as a rough measure of assimilation.|$|E
5000|$|The nail knot, {{also known}} as the tube knot or gryp knot, is mostly used in carp and fly-fishing. The nail knot was named because a nail was {{inserted}} as a guide when threading the line. <b>Today,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to use a small straw. The nail knot is an important fishing knot used to join two lines of different diameters and allows for line diameters to diminish down to the fly. I.E., it is useful for attaching your backing to the fly line, and your fly line to the leader, or tippet. The knot can be tied in multiple ways and is uniform. Most common uses in fly-fishing are attaching the leader to the fly line and attaching the fly line to the backing. Fly-fishing is an angling method in which an artificial [...] "fly" [...] is used to catch fish. The fly is cast using a fly rod, reel, and specialized weighted line. Casting a nearly weightless fly or [...] "lure" [...] requires casting techniques significantly different from other forms of casting. Fly fishermen use hand-tied flies that resemble natural invertebrates or other food organisms, or [...] "lures" [...] to provoke the fish to strike. Carp anglers use the nail knot to attach monofilament-fishing line and/or braided fishing line to lead core leader material.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: {{personal}} story, history, place, travel Jane {{emphasizes that}} back then, {{they had not}} been aware of the dangers of working with the ore. It was only recently that they have been given that information. When the season was over and they were ready to move, the women cleaned the camp and made it ready for the next season. Alfred adds that when the ice breaks up after winter, the ice goes up right over the camp site at Bennett Field. So the site gets cleaned for them by the ice in spring. Before they left the camp in fall, they would tie things up and put them higher, so that the ice would not destroy them. (Interviewer I. Fink asks questions about “women travelling and living on the land”) During the seasons Jane and Alfred would always travel and life in on the land. They only stopped that recently because of their age. As a women Jane has been at all the places around Great Bear Lake where her husband had been, like for example Sǫba Ké or Bennett Field. (Interviewer I. Fink asks questions about Délı̨nę as a (winter) camp before it became a permanent settlement) People were very nomadic. In winter there were hardly any people at Délı̨nę. In the 1950 ties a school was built and from that on, people started to come more regularly and to build houses at Délı̨nę. In the old days, sometime only the men would travel and the women would stay home, for example the men would leave in November to go trapping and then come back for Christmas. At other occasions the whole family would travel together. One reason why people came to Délı̨nę was also because of prophet Ayah. Long time ago it was very hard, because there was no electricity or other comforts and it was very cold (“eligu nadzé”). Everything was dependent on wood and dog teams. There were no houses. Alfred emphasizes that when elders talk about the past it is the truth, because it is because it is based on their own experience or the experience of people he talked to personally. This is always the case when elders talk about something – they talk about their own experience and what they know for sure, because they eye witnessed it. That is why it is always the truth. When Alfred was young, they went to places where the elders knew that there would be animals or fish. The parents always took their children with them even when they were very young. So the kids also went through hard times together with their parents. In the past elders were very strong people. They worked all the time, they were always doing something. Through that they wanted to make sure to have a good life. The phrase “naezó gǫá” means that the elders wanted a good life for everyone through their work. It also helped them to stay healthy for a long time. Dene people are strong minded people and they want to share their knowledge. That is why they are strong. Even though people got sickness in the past Alfred never heard an elder complain about being sick or having sore knees etc. Alfred’s father, Loui Taniton, is a very good example. He lived to be 105 years old. He is an example that if you take good care for yourself, you can live for a very long time. In the old days the elders were so healthy because of the good food they ate. They would eat fresh fish out of the lake and eat it before it was fully cooked {{with a little bit of}} blood in it. When the shot moose, they would drink the fresh blood from the moose. That is why they were so healthy. The water from Great Bear Lake is very fresh and pure and it would give them strength. The difference to the modern way of life, the mola way, is that they mola wanted everything nice, clean and new. The Dene people lived different in the past in their own way. When it snowed in the old days, they would melt snow and make tea with it. Today we live in a different environment, in a different world. It is getting harder for us to depend on the water or the snow (to make tea). Many changes are happening. There is an increase sickness, cancer rates and other health problems. When furnaces were first introduced, they probably produced fumes and that also caused health problems. Outside there is fresh and clean air. So with the way people are living <b>today,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to become sick. We are here today to share stories to help you and the people in the future. We do these recordings to tell people important things that they should know, also about language.

That is why they do not learn about their language, their culture and their tradition. That is why we are here today to share about our past, our presence in order to help them in the future.

Methods: Rules was extracted from a case study with focus on a Mobile Money system and limits was calculated by using quantiles.

What are their opinions, attitudes and feelings about what this entails in their lives? Material/Method: The essay is based on four focus group interviews with sixteen students from Uppsala University aged 23 - 26, two groups consisting of women and two groups consisting of men. The ICT & Internet research is developing rapidly which led me to do an exploratory study that is hypothesis-generating and which I hope can be used for forthcoming research of the consequences of the ICT society. The empiric result has been analyzed from a behavioural science perspective. Main results: The results have been interesting from several perspectives. The focus groups seem to think that the Internet and cell phone use is the best thing that has happened. They are so-called "Multitaskers" and have no problems to do several things simultaneously. The relationship between ICT and stress becomes slightly more noticeable among the girls. I dare to say that the constant availability do result in a certain stress, which I based on the clear statements about stress that came up between the lines.

40|$|Second place {{winner of}} poster presentations in the Social Science section at the 10 th Annual Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity Forum (URCAF) {{held at the}} Eugene Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 23, 2010 Purpose: The older {{generation}} is often overlooked by society <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to forget about their quality of life. This study was important {{to find out how}} that population can best be served. Also, the “Baby-boomers” are getting to the age where they are to enter assisted living facilities. Because of this, even more of the society is to be affected by this topic. The purpose of the study is to understand the gender differences in regards to bereavement, social support, and depression in older adult assisted living residents. Methods: This research is a cross sectional survey study conducted by face-to-face interviews utilizing a quantitative method. Non-probability and purposive sampling methods were used to generate a total of 100 participants aged 65 and over living in assisted living facilities. Those interviewed were interviewed in March at six assisted living facilities in Wichita, Kansas. A structured survey questionnaire was used to measure the dependent variable, which were gender differences. The questionnaire included multiple scales to measure the independent variables, which were bereavement, social support and depression. Results: This study showed significant differences between gender for social support, depression, and bereavement of older adult assisted living residents. The study showed that women received more social support than men. Women {{were more likely to be}} depressed then men. Loss of a loved one will affect women more adversely then men. Overall the study showed that women were more affected by depression, bereavement and social support then men. Implications: The significance of this study is to help contribute to the improvement of the overall health of older adults in assisted living facilities. Assisted living facilities and caseworkers need to offer adequate counseling and therapist for the older adults to help them empower their overall wellbeing.
