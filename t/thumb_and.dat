5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Rodríguez {{suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in a game}} against the Anaheim Angels. While trying to make a throw to second base, his thumb made contact with the swing of Mo Vaughn's bat. He fractured his right <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> underwent surgery the next day. This injury caused him to miss the rest of the season. Rodríguez appeared in just 91 games, which was the fewest that he appeared in since his first season in the league, 1991. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Alex Rodriguez (2002), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). Even though he was injured, he was still named to the second-team of Baseball America's Major League Baseball All-Star Team.|$|E

5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|R

5|$|The {{last name}} applied to M-53 is the Earle Memorial Highway, {{named in honor}} of Horatio Earle, Michigan's first State Highway Commissioner. Earle was {{instrumental}} in the early Good Roads Movement in the state and the creation of the Michigan State Highway Department, which is now MDOT. When the original legislation creating a highway agency was declared unconstitutional in 1903, he kept the job in an unofficial capacity until the Legislature could rectify the situation. Earle designated that the first mile of state reward road in The <b>Thumb,</b> <b>and</b> residents formed a group to lobby to have the road named in his honor. The State Highway Commissioner Murray Van Wagoner designated M-53 in Earle's memory in April 1939, and the Legislature legislation two years later honoring him, but not officially naming the road. That was corrected in 2001 when the statutes naming various highways in the state were consolidated, and M-53 was officially designated the Earle Memorial Highway.|$|E
5|$|Though Shuey {{struggled}} upon {{joining the}} Dodgers, recording a 9.35 ERA {{in his first}} eleven appearances after the trade, he altered his approach and began to obtain better results, allowing no runs in his next five appearances. Shuey played for the Dodgers {{through the end of}} the 2003 season. During spring training prior to the 2004 season, he tore a ligament in his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> reinjured his hip while fielding a bunt during his rehabilitation. Shuey spent the entire season on the disabled list. The Dodgers sued the Hartford Life Insurance Company, who insured Shuey's contract, over Shuey's $3.25 million salary for the 2004 season, saying the insurance company did not honor their claim.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a <b>thumb,</b> <b>and</b> is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

5|$|The first soldier cabins {{were built}} in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan {{and all of these}} were later removed. Cabins were also built at the Lower Geyser Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Riverside and at Soda Butte. As more {{outposts}} were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet (1887), Snake River (Polecat Creek), West <b>Thumb</b> <b>and</b> Riverside (1892), Mud Geyser (1895), Norris and Thumb Bay (1897), Lake (1899), Snake River (1902), Gardiner (1903), West Thumb, Syvan Pass and Soda Butte (1904), Tower (1907), Crevice Mountain (1912), Snake River (1914), and Aster Creek, Cabin Creek, Harebell, and Thorofare (1915). Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at Astringent Creek, Bartlet, Boundary Creek, Coulter Creek, Hellroaring Creek, Lewis River, Park Point, Proposition, Trappers Creek, Trout Creek and Willow Creek. While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence, four remote structures remain. They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin (Bldg 234) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations (Bldgs 111 and 231). The Norris soldier station currently houses the Museum of the National Park Ranger. Additionally, the Bechler River barn (Bldg 232) is still in existence.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his left <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E
