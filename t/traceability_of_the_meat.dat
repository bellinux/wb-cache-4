40|$|Nero Siciliano (NS; Sicilian Black) {{is a local}} pig breed reared on {{the island}} of Sicily mainly under {{extensive}} management. The breed is well adapted to marginal conditions and is appreciated for its reproductive performance, disease resistance and production of tasty meat. For a genetic characterization of this breed we analyzed the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight major or candidate genes (ryanodine receptor 1, RYR 1; Na+, K+ ATPase subunit α 2, ATP 1 A 2; myosin heavy chain 2 B, MYH 4; sarcolipin, SLN; cathepsin B, CTSB; cystatin B, CSTB; estrogen receptor, ESR; melanocortin receptor 1, MC 1 R) for performance and phenotypic traits. The animals that were sampled and analyzed represent about 6 - 8 % of the total NS pig population. PCR-RFLP or PCR-SSCP techniques were used to type the DNA markers in the selected loci. Exact test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was computed for each locus, Fis statistics and heterozygosity were calculated for each locus and over all loci. Allele frequencies obtained in NS breed were compared to the frequencies already available in literature for the Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Belgian Landrace, Piétrain, Hampshire and Meishan breeds. For the ESR locus, as no information on the distribution of the two alleles were available, we typed a sample of unrelated pigs from the considered breeds. Even if only eight loci were studied in NS breed, important elements were obtained from the data. The 1843 T (n) allele at the RYR 1 locus is present in NS breed, thus the molecular test to identify the carriers of this allele should be adopted to avoid its spreading in the population. Moreover, other studies are needed to clarify the allelic structure of the MC 1 R gene, which affects coat color, in order to evaluate if this gene could be used in genetic tests for the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> products of this breed. Finally, the present work represents an attempt to evaluate data on mutations within major and candidate genes with the final aim to provide information that could be useful for the conservation and valorization of local farm animal genetic resources...|$|E
40|$|The current {{paper is}} part of a complex study: “Designing an {{information}} system for monitoring <b>the</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pig <b>meat</b> production”. In <b>the</b> European Union (EU) product safety and product quality represent basic conditions for international trade. In order to fulfill those requirements, all actors across the supply chain must implement a system capable to tracking and tracing a particular unit located within the supply chain; this goal could be achieved implementing an association of a flow <b>of</b> information with <b>the</b> physical flow <b>of</b> goods. In <b>the</b> EU were developed and implemented some standards and protocols for Food Quality Assurance Schemes (QAS) elaborated by various groups and organizations 1. The project aims in to develop an informational system for monitoring the traceability in <b>the</b> pig <b>meat</b> production in order to improve the product quality and to ensure the food safety. <b>The</b> main activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project have in total 20 months, starting from August 2008 and ending in March 2009 as it follows: (1) Study concerning <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>the</b> legislative and practical needs of national and international traceability in pork meat production and it’s monitoring.

40|$|AbstractThe future {{agriculture}} {{must maintain}} biodiversity and assure food production by the implementation ofdurableinnovative technologies. It {{is important to}} use innovative methods {{in order to determine}} <b>the</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> animal products as <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> bio-economy supposesthe reduction of external marginal costs with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> social benefit by <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bio- resources used. The private marginal benefit for each animal breeder is also represented by <b>the</b> corrective subvention <b>of</b> 10 euros/animal and the co-operation with the sanitary- veterinary authorities leads to <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> positive externalities. These external marginal benefits must be promoted and supported for an optimal time so as to eliminate sick animals from each EU country. The research team used advanced tools to identify <b>the</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food products (<b>meat</b> or milk) from different breeds as well as <b>the</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> certain traditional products by molecular tests based on <b>the</b> identification, amplification <b>of</b> nucleic acids for <b>the</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> food products (by PCR techniques). Several methods for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> genetic <b>traceability</b> were tested and applied. <b>The</b> best <b>of</b> all seems to be the DNA analysis as “Genetic Fingerprinting”, which can be found in each cell and more recently, the micro-satellite analysis. This scientific paper presents <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> research concerning <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> genotypes by microsatellite genetic markers, collecting and preserving the tissue samples by Typi Fix method as well as <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> positive externalities, which have a role in substantiating the decisions to put into practice certain scientific research result...|$|R

The comparison will concern the sensorial and nutritional qualities. Another aim will concern <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> some methodologies {{to be used to}} trace the production system (organic vs conventional) on the product or the animal. The experimental design is : -Comparison of male Limousin house-fed lambs produced under organic (12 lambs) vs conventional (12 lambs) farming. These lambs are fed with concentrate and hay indoors. The feeds are produced under organic vs conventional farming for the organic vs conventional treatments respectively, but <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentrate is similar as far as raw material is concerned. -Comparison of male Limousin grass-fed lambs produced under organic (12 lambs) vs conventional (12 lambs) farming. These lambs are fed exclusively grass at pasture. The pastures are fertilized with 100 kg N/ha in the conventional treatment vs no N/ha in the organic treatment. It is likely that the sward and diet composition (proportion of legumes particularly) will be different between the organic and the conventional treatment. To study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> production system sensu stricto and avoid potential bias, lamb growth rate is maintained at the same level in both systems. -Measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensorial quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> (longissimus dorsi) and carcass : Panellists session for juiciness, tenderness, flavour of chops.
