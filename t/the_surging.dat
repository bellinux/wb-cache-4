5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and <b>the</b> <b>surging</b> water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation {{in the weeks after}} the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary August Decrees (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Now their attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist <b>the</b> <b>surging</b> strength of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative veto power for the king. Many of the reformers were left aghast by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe <b>the</b> existing <b>surge</b> tank solutions and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tanks and how it affects the hydropower plant. The high head hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tanks can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a Surge Tank Atlas, where <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank solutions are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from <b>the</b> simulations. This <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different surge tank solutions for both a high head and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank solutions. Increasing <b>the</b> distance from <b>surge</b> tank to turbine, decreasing <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank volume or a strong throttling of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank. Other conclusions vary between the open and <b>the</b> closed <b>surge</b> tank, and <b>the</b> high and low head hydropower plant. <b>The</b> closed <b>surge</b> tank shows a better dampening of the water hammer than <b>the</b> open <b>surge</b> tank for both hydropower plant, <b>the</b> closed <b>surge</b> tank can be throttled stronger than <b>the</b> open <b>surge</b> tanks, and <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tanks at <b>the</b> low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the high head plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the high head hydropower plant. Hence there are some significant differences in the hydraulic behavior between <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> tank solutions and the high head and the low head hydropower plant, that will be presented and discussed in <b>the</b> <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas...|$|R

We analyze {{data from}} two FAST {{satellite}} {{passes in the}} vicinity of auroral surges (as seen in the VIS auroral imager on the Polar satellite) to study the large scale ionospheric electrodynamics of <b>the</b> <b>surge,</b> focusing in particular on the configuration of field-aligned and ionospheric currents. While most previous ground and satellite observations have found <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> to be a region of predominantly upward field-aligned currents (FACs), some satellite observations have found evidence for equal downward and upward FACs near <b>the</b> <b>surge,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> FACs close locally as opposed to globally through the substorm current wedge. Our observations show that while regions of both upward and downward FACs are present near <b>the</b> <b>surge,</b> there is a significant net upward FAC in the northern portion of meridians passing through <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> and just east of <b>the</b> <b>surge.</b> Current continuity requires that these upward currents be fed by downward currents traditionally thought to be in the eastern portion the auroral substorm bulge. Such a current configuration requires a westward ionospheric current to connect the two FAC regions, and this is supported by our observations of a significant southward electric field in the high Hall conductance surge region, which drives a strong westward Hall electrojet connecting <b>the</b> upward <b>surge</b> FACs and <b>the</b> presumed downward FACs east of <b>the</b> <b>surge...</b>|$|R
