500|$|Immediately {{after taking}} office <b>Tailer</b> engaged in {{political}} housecleaning, eliminating land bank opponents and Dudley supporters {{from a number of}} provincial positions. [...] His efforts, however, backfired: the provincial assembly elected Joseph Dudley's son Paul as attorney general, and London agents of the anti-bank party worked to ensure Tailer's replacement. [...] (One of those agents, Jonathan Belcher, would ironically become a <b>Tailer</b> ally in later years and secure the lieutenant governorship for him the third time.) [...] Through their efforts the king chose Colonel Samuel Shute, a land bank opponent, to replace Burges, and William Dummer as Shute's lieutenant governor. [...] <b>Tailer</b> was turned out of office with Shute's arrival in October 1716.

Burges, however, was bribed by land bank opponents to resign his post before leaving England. [...] The commissions of Burges and <b>Tailer</b> had by then been sent to Massachusetts, and <b>Tailer</b> became acting governor in November 1715 after they were formally proclaimed.|$|E

[...] He successfully convinced Lord Cobham that he deserved one for his service at Port Royal in 1710, and was awarded the half pay of a colonel, amounting to £400 per year.

500|$|<b>Tailer</b> {{eventually}} {{returned to}} Massachusetts.

[...] Shute handled the negotiations poorly, raising tensions between the Abenaki and British settlers. [...] In 1720 <b>Tailer</b> was one of several commissioners sent to mediate between the settlers and Abenaki. [...] Although a potential basis for agreement was identified, continued raiding and disagreement on the details of proposed terms caused the situation to deteriorate further.

[...] (Dudley had been raised in the Puritan way, and had formally adopted Anglican practices while in England in the 1690s.) [...] He and Dudley were also {{on opposite sides of the}} debate on the province's currency problems. [...] Dudley favored the issuance of public bills of credit as a means to circumvent the inflationary issuance of paper currency that had become a serious problem by the end of Queen Anne's War in 1713, while <b>Tailer,</b> along with his father-in-law Nathaniel Byfield and others, favored the establishment of a private land bank, that would issue bills secured by the lands of its investors.|$|E

40|$|A sailing {{simulator}} {{is described}} {{that takes into}} account human factors with respect to strategic decisions during a race. Models for yacht-crew interaction have been designed and implemented for the helmsman and the sail <b>tailers,</b> as well as a ‘routing engine’ that solves problems of a strategical and a tactical nature (e. g. navigation in windshifts, collision avoidance). One or more users can interact with the simulator, so that their behaviour and decision-making process can be recorded, analyzed and compared to that of the automatic crews. The software was implemented in MATLAB-Simulink and consists of two modules: ‘Robo-Yacht’, for solo and drag races, and ‘Robo-Race’ for fleet regattas. In the latter case, a real-time animation of the race is delivered to the user in real-time within a virtual reality environment.

40|$|Aim of the project: To {{explore the}} role of celebrities as an {{aspirational}} reference group {{for members of the}} Generation Y in the online context so that retailers can {{have a better understanding of}} this target market and improve their online marketing strategies. Methodology: The methodology consisted of a qualitative research with data collected by using semi-structured interviews. Looking at the symbolic consumption of young people and attitudes towards celebrity advertising, the qualitative analysis offers descriptions of personal thoughts and experience rather than statistics. An exploratory netnography was conducted to complement the findings that emerged from the interviews and to investigate the impact of the celebrity culture within the online environment. Key findings: There is evidence of celebrity influence amongst the majority of respondents. Fashion-wise, they are selective in the celebrities they wish to follow. The Generation Y is appreciative of e-tailers like ASOS that make use of the celebrity image, so long as this technique stays subtle. Those e-tailers must carefully select the most influential celebrities with regards to their target audience. The impact of the celebrity culture on the Internet has been very significant since the ‘new’ media and the social media. Further qualitative work is needed to explore other online platforms than e- <b>tailers,</b> such as the social media...|$|R

These consumers are spoilt for choices and are presented not only with different products and brands but also with diverse retailer formats such as departmental stores, specialty stores, and online shopping platforms. The prospect of online shopping is increasing in India because of many factors such as increased Internet literacy, perceived usefulness, ease of use, increased number of working women, entry from the global and local participants, and the increased visibility of online players, to name a few.
