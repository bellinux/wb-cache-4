40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{availability}} of angular-stable plate/screw systems {{led to a}} euphoric use of these implants {{for the treatment of}} displaced proximal humerus fractures. The high implant costs seem to be justified by a potentially improved outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty one patients (20 female, 11 male, mean age: 62 +/- 16 years) with two-, three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures (Neer classification) were operated using the proximal humeral internal locking system (PHILOS). The mean follow-up time was 19 +/- 3 postoperative months (range: 340 - 720 days). Functional results (Constant score, UCLA-score) were analysed and compared to an equivalent historic control group of 60 patients operated for the same fracture types using two one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plates.</b> Additionally, total implant costs for each technique were compared. RESULTS: Complications in the PHILOS group included one implant failure with refracture, one secondary dislocation, two cases of subacromial impingement, and two cases of partial avascular necrosis of the humeral head. The mean Constant score (age- and sex-matched) was 80 +/- 11 % for the affected side and 104 +/- 13 % for the healthy side. The UCLA scores were excellent in 10 %, good in 67 %, and fair in 23 % of the patients. Complication rate and functional results did not differ significantly from the control group treated with one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plates.</b> Implant costs were significantly higher for the PHILOS group (684 +/- 40 Euro vs. 158 +/- 20 Euro, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed similar functional results using either plate. Although the PHILOS plate may provide important advantages in specific situations, such as osteoporotic bone, its use as a standard must be carefully judged under the economic aspect of the significant higher implant costs...|$|R

40|$|New {{concepts}} in plate fixation {{have led to}} an evolution in plate design for olecranon fractures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the stiffness and strength of locking compression plate (LCP) fixation to one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plate</b> fixation in a cadaveric comminuted olecranon fracture model with a standardised osteotomy. Five matched pairs of cadaveric elbows were randomly assigned for fixation by either a contoured LCP combined with an intramedullary screw and unicortical locking screws or a one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plate</b> combined with bicortical screws. Construct stiffness was measured by subjecting the specimens to cyclic loading while measuring gapping at the osteotomy site. Construct strength was measured by subjecting specimens to ramp load until failure. There was no significant difference in fixation stiffness and strength between the two fixation methods. All failures consisted of failure of the bone and not of the hardware.

Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?F to protect the fluidized bed distributor plate. In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic distributor plate with a Ceramic <b>Tubular</b> Distributor <b>Plate</b> (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods. The ceramic unit permitted energy from flue gases to be recovered without diluting gases. Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages. The fluidized bed particles enhance heat transfer and continually clean the finned tubes in the fluidized beds.

There were 4 noncomminuted olecranon fractures, treated with K-wires and single tension-band wiring. The remaining 10 fractures were complex fractures, treated in 3 cases with multiple K-wires and single tension-band wiring, in 2 by use of one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plates,</b> in 1 with a 3. 5 -mm dynamic compression plate, and in the remaining 4 with 3. 5 -mm reconstruction plates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of one-third tubular plates for the treatment of benign defects in the medial distal metaphysis of the femur. Benign cysts are a common occurrence in long bones, and are of concern in load-bearing bones, such as the tibia and femur. These space-occupying growths are removed by curettage of the affected region. Numerous post-curettage management options have been described in the literature, which generally include filling the defect with either synthetic or biological materials. Unfortunately, complications, such as infectious disease transmission, thermal injury, and a robust inflammatory have all been reported in the literature. In response to these concerns, a number of studies reported successful healing of benign cortical defects in long bones with no augmentation after curettage, however, the lack of structural support results in an increased risk of fracture through the defect site. Therefore, it is advantageous to investigate a treatment option that adds structural support to the defect site and permits the use of osteoconductive and osteoinductive materials within the bone cavity. The {{purpose of this}} thesis was threefold: First, a quasi-static experimental comparison of intact and cortical defect specimens was conducted to determine the structural consequences incurred by the introduction of a 15 mm cortical defect under isolated axial and torsional loads. Second, an experimental combined axial/torsional fatigue analysis was employed to further analyze the behavior of the defect specimens, and to determine the structural stiffness regained by the addition of a one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plate.</b> Third, a numerical approach was used to consider the structural consequences of varying sized defects under isolated and combined quasi-static axial and torsional loading, and to further analyze the results of adding the plate to the defect specimens. This study revealed that a one-third <b>tubular</b> <b>plate</b> might be a clinically viable option for structural support of small cortical defects in the distal femur. Furthermore, the loss in stiffness by the defect is exacerbated under combined axial/torsional loading. This is a more physiologically relevant loading mode and may provide more clinically useful results...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionComminuted {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} ulna are severe injuries {{often associated with}} bone and ligament injuries of the elbow joint (Monteggia lesion, radial head fractures, dislocation of the elbow). The treatment of these fractures is very demanding and the functional results often fairly mediocre due to associated injuries. Based on a single-center retrospective study, we report {{the results of the}} treatment of these fractures fixed using a double-plate technique. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of this fixation mode and to compare it with other fractures series using a single plate fixation (in terms of bone union, elbow joint function, and complications stemming from the plates). Patients and methodsEighteen patients sustained a comminuted proximal ulna fracture between 2002 and 2006. The fractures were associated in five cases with a Monteggia type lesion, in two cases with elbow dislocation, and in four cases with a Mason 3 radial head fracture. Four patients had an open fracture. These comminuted ulna fractures included nine Mayo Clinic IIIB fractures. Bone fixation was performed with two third-cylinder <b>tubular</b> <b>plates,</b> one plate {{on each side of the}} proximal ulna. This allows more versatile solutions for screw insertion. Functional assessment (according to Broberg and Morrey) and radiological evaluation (bone healing) were provided at 6  months and at the longest follow-up by an independent surgeon. ResultsSixteen of 18  patients achieved bone union. No septic complications occurred and no hardware removal was required on patient request. In 67 % of the cases, the Morrey score indicated excellent or good results with a mean score of 82. DiscussionThere are no reports in the literature on the technical point of fixation concerning complex fractures of the ulna. Two plates mean the possibility of twice the number of screw insertions for epiphyseal reconstruction. This fixation remains easy to perform and provides stable anatomic reconstruction of the ulna.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the separation of}} vaporous alcohol-water mixtures using the FricDiff separation technology. This separation process {{is based on a}} difference in interspecies friction between the components of a feed mixture and a sweep gas. A comparison is made between the performances of <b>tubular</b> and <b>plate</b> FricDiff-modules for several dimensions of the module using the finite element program COMSOL MultiphysicsTM [Comsol, 2006. COMSOL Multiphysics User's Guide, version 3. 3]. It is shown that these configurations give different results when the fluxes through the porous barrier (which separates the feed mixture compartment from the compartment where the sweep gas is flowing) increase. These differences {{can be attributed to the}} resistances to mass transfer located in flow channels adjacent to the porous barrier. These resistances are different for the two configurations and when they become dominant, the <b>tubular</b> and <b>plate</b> FricDiff-modules behave differently. Sherwood correlations are derived to describe the resistances to mass transfer in the flow channels. Both the developing and fully developed boundary layer regimes are taken into account. In the developing regime, the derivation is based on that of a pseudo-binary system, consisting of one of the feed components and the sweep gas. In the fully developed regime the true multi-component behavior of the system is taken into account. It is shown that these Sherwood correlations give a very accurate description of the separation process in a FricDiff-module. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Techniques for {{treating}} complex proximal humeral fractures vary and include fixations using tension bands, percutaneous pins, bone suture, T-plates, intramedullary nails, double <b>tubular</b> <b>plates,</b> hemiarthroplasty, plant tan humerus fixator plates, Polaris nails and blade plates. Complications {{of these techniques}} include cutout or {{back out of the}} screws and plates, avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion, nail migration, rotator cuff impairment and impingement syndromes. Insufficient anchorage from conventional implants may lead to early loosening and failure, especially in osteoporotic bones. In general, nonoperative treatment of displaced three and four-part fractures of the proximal humerus leads to poor outcome due to intraarticular nature of injury and inherent instability of the fragments. Comminuted fractures of the proximal humerus are at risk of fixation failure, screw loosening and fracture displacement. Open reduction and internal fixation with conventional plate and screws has been associated with unacceptably high incidence of screw pull out. PHILOS (the proximal humeral internal locking system) plate is an internal fixation system that enables angled stabilisation with multiple interlocking screws for fractures of the proximal humerus.

40|$|The life of {{lead-acid}} batteries {{is typically}} governed by corrosion {{of the positive}} grid. The grid experiences highly oxidising environments which, in turn, corrodes the grid material. However, the resulting corrosion layer is essential to create an electrically conductive bond between the grid and active material. Additionally, alloying elements are necessary to allow low-cost production techniques to be used. The selection of grid material is therefore a compromise between function, life and ease-of-manufacture. <b>Tubular</b> <b>plate</b> lead-acid batteries have historically used antimonial-lead alloys as the grid alloy. These alloys impart mechanical strength within a die-cast grid and provide a suitably conductive oxide within the corrosion layer. The use of tin in many lead alloy blends {{has resulted in a}} beneficial effect on the corrosion rate of these alloys. Tin-lead alloys are used in thin plate lead-acid batteries. However there is no published data on their use for grids of tubular plates in deep-cycling applications. A simple binary, low-tin lead alloy has been tested and found to exhibit a significantly lower corrosion rate during periods of heavy cycling when compared to a traditional low-antimony based alloy. However, it was shown that under severe over-charge conditions, the tin-lead alloy corroded at a significantly faster rate than that of an antimonial alloy. The lead-tin alloy performed well as a positive grid material throughout 500 cycles. No indications of premature capacity loss were observed and the ability of the alloy to be recharged was excellent. Electron microprobe analysis of sections of cycled positive plates showed the doping effect of tin within the corrosion layer of the grid material. This effect led to an increase in the conductivity of the layer, resulting in an increased ion-conductivity of the corrosion layer. The corrosion layer of each alloy type was found to be fine, densely packed and uniformly structured under cycling conditions, but it became more porous during periods of severe over-charge. The tin-based alloy was shown to produce a thinner corrosion layer at completion of 500 cycles when compared to that of the antimonial alloy. Further, the corrosion layer of the tin based alloy was found to be less cracked than that of the antimonial based alloy. Finally, this investigation could not identify any reasons why a tin-based grid alloy has not been identified for use in <b>tubular</b> <b>plate</b> deep-cycle batteries previously. The alloy was shown to perform well under both charge and discharge conditions and was not found to suffer premature capacity loss. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

The wound complication rate was 5. 5 % in the conventional plating group, and 17. 5 % in the locking plate group (p= 0. 019). This difference was largely due {{to an increase in}} major complications, for which removal of the plate was necessary (p= 0. 008). There is a significant increase in wound complications in distal fibular fractures treated with a locking compression plate. In light of the current study, we would caution against the application of the currently used locking compression plates in the treatment of distal fibular fracture...|$|E
50|$|In a {{plate girder}} bridge, the plate girders are {{typically}} I-beams made up from separate structural steel plates (rather than rolled {{as a single}} cross-section), which are welded or, in older bridges, bolted or riveted together to form the vertical web and horizontal flanges of the beam. In some cases, the plate girders may be formed in a Z-shape rather than I-shape.The first <b>tubular</b> wrought iron <b>plate</b> girder bridge was built in 1846-47 by James Millholland for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.|$|R
40|$|One {{good thing}} about this {{symposium}} on flow chemistry is that {{at least half of}} the papers was on actual applications: summarized one member of the audience of the IPIT symposium in Rotterdam, 25 May 2012. This remark can be viewed as a compliment to the organizer, TNO, a Dutch contract research organization. More importantly, it shows that flow chemistry is, slowly but steadily, being accepted in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutics. In order to get flow chemistry accepted in the fine chemicals industry, one should not called it so. This industry is so used to working with batches in a tank reactor, that the simple mentioning of flow chemistry, or continuous production of chemicals in <b>tubular</b> or <b>plate</b> like reactors, does not go down well, according to several authors at the IPIT 2012 symposium in Rotterdam. But is not the only factor that is causing flow chemistry’s slow progress in the industry...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: www. elsevier. com/locate/cesFrom an analysis of fluid velocity and electric field profiles the trajectory of particles through crossflow microfiltration units has been calculated. A tubular geometry filter leads to the most effective use of electrical power, when it is used as an aid to prevent membrane fouling. Results for <b>plate,</b> <b>tubular</b> and multitube filters are given. Some experimental data from a tubular filter are presented, which demonstrate typical effects of the important parameters...|$|R
