Now the dollar is so low, in addition - all the big studios are empty, no one uses them anymore. The first single La Belle Epoque was released on March 12 and the album Tigerdrottningen was released on April 30. During the month of May Kent went on a small club tour in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
500|$|Lord {{had been}} the main writer {{on the first two}} albums and his {{classical}} music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of the British progressive rock band The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson on keyboards. On Deep Purple Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured [...] "Blind" [...] and in the orchestral section of [...] "April", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being hard at work in writing and arranging his Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Lord's dominance was balanced in this release by the space as writer and performer achieved by Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer especially on the [...] "tribal" [...] opening track [...] "Chasing Shadows", where he had his first chance at songwriting. Bass player Nick Simper later stated that [...] "there was a lot of pressure from Jon Lord <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of semi-classical stuff [...] we didn't actually rebel against it until the third album." ...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{take a look}} {{at three}} modern Arthurian stories which portray Mordred in a {{positive}} way. Mordred, one of the main villains of Arthurian legend, is here presented quite differently.

500|$|On a {{slightly}} less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to get on to the next phase." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking [...] "since {{the number of people that}} had the power and knowledge <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of thing was low." [...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E

Mulroney criticizes Trudeau for avoiding military service in World War II, and favourably references sources that describe the young Trudeau as holding anti-Semitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators. Tom Axworthy, a prominent Liberal strategist, responded that Trudeau should be judged on his mature views.

SAT Deputy Governor Sakol Wannapong has said [...] "Organizing a MMA event here would hurt the image of Muay Thai, if you want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of business, you should do it in another country.

In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men.

6000|$|Exactly in {{the same}} way the ruder or more {{sluggish}} races regard the civilisation of Christendom. If they have any respect for it, it is precisely because it does not use their own coarse and cruel expedients. According to some modern moralists whenever Zulus cut off the heads of dead Englishmen, Englishmen must cut off the heads of dead Zulus. Whenever Arabs or Egyptians constantly use the whip to their slaves, Englishmen must use the whip to their subjects. And on a similar principle (I suppose), whenever an English Admiral has to fight cannibals the English Admiral ought to eat them. However unattractive a menu consisting entirely of barbaric kings may appear to an English gentleman, he must try to sit down to it with an appetite. He must fight the Sandwich Islanders with their own weapons; and their own weapons are knives and forks.

[...] The Soudanese say to each other, [...] "This hardy people never flogs its servants; it is superior to the simplest and most obvious human pleasures."
