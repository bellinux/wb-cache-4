They were not {{told that it}} was Silcott's fourth murder trial, {{that he had been}} out on bail for the murder of Anthony Smith when Blakelock was killed, or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder. Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E

This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E

25|$|Frank DeSimone {{is accused}} of ruining the Los Angeles family's {{reputation}} and integrity. Nonetheless, DeSimone was featured in Look Magazine in 1965 {{as one of the}} decade's notable figures in organized crime; DeSimone sued the magazine for libel. Jimmy Fratianno also blamed DeSimone in his 1953 extortion case for having been sent to Folsom prison on a six-year extortion conviction, after dealing with fellow con-artists James B. Modica (a man who 'bumped' slot machines and liquor store owners in Tarzana) and Dominic Raspona. Jimmy Fratianno also accused DeSimone of ruining his extortion case defense case by not recording one of the defendant's key witnesses who skipped town before being able to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> DeSimone was later disbarred because of his criminal activities.|$|E
25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping on their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to New York Times reporter David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, Hans Reiser filed a civil lawsuit. In his {{complaint}} {{he named}} more than 70 defendants, including trial judges and his attorney, William H. Du Bois. He claimed, among other things, that his attorney conspired {{with the judge}} to file motions against him, which were impossible to appeal, and that his attorney had forced him to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> against his will. After several rounds of amendments and additional complaints, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means that Reiser can no longer file civil lawsuits regarding his current convictions. The judges voiced several errors before the dismissal. According to the judges: Reiser's complaint was too long (more than 300 pages in its original form). He had too many defendants, and they included judges, who are immune to lawsuits regarding their official conduct. Finally, the judges could not decide {{whether there was a}} cause of action (any illegal deed or event, which could be prosecuted) to accept the plea. Reiser argued that he had not had access to the prison law library and that he had been denied the appointment of an attorney to help him formulate his complaint.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, exactly {{three years}} from the day Premier Hariri was assassinated on the Beirut seafront, throngs of protesters rallied in Martyr's Square to commemorate the occasion. The crowd came from all over Lebanon. Hundreds of {{thousands}} of protesters filled the square and its immediate surrounding. In the mountainous areas, the weather conditions prevented several processions from reaching Beirut. Also, processions closed all roads east, north & south Beirut leading to Martyr's Square. Hundreds of boats embarked on a ride from the Jounieh port in the coast of Mount Lebanon to the Beirut Marina defying the winter waves. The rally was reaching its end while thousands of vehicles carrying protesters were still trapped in traffic in the Eastern Suburbs of Beirut. The crowds stood for more than 5 hours under the pouring rain. The protesters transformed this event into an occasion to blame Syria and renew their oath to remain united and defiant for Lebanon's sake. At the exact time the explosion occurred 3 years ago at 12:55, the crowds fell silent as the Islamic Adhan sounded through the mosques' muezzin along with the tolling of church bells symbolizing the Muslim-Christian unity. The leaders of the Anti-Syrian coalition gave fiery speeches blaming Syria & Iran for Lebanon's woes. Saad Hariri, the coalition's most popular leader, {{was the last to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> as supporting cheers blared from the crowds. In the end and after the crowds have stood for four consecutive hours under the pouring rain, the rally was concluded and the area was evacuated.|$|E

500|$|Hinckley {{was found}} {{not guilty by reason of}} {{insanity}} on June 21, 1982. The defense psychiatric reports had found him to be insane while the prosecution reports declared him legally sane. Following his lawyers' advice, he declined to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in his own defense. Hinckley was confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. full-time until 2006, at which point he began a program of spending gradually more time at his mother's home. On September 10, 2016, Hinckley was permitted to permanently leave the hospital to live with his mother full-time, under court supervision and with mandatory psychiatric treatment. After his trial, he wrote that the shooting was [...] "the greatest love offering in the history of the world", and did not then indicate regrets.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson {{appealed the}} conviction, but his pre-trial confessions, his {{knowledge}} of the [...] "secret details" [...] and his refusal to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> during the trial led to the application for leave to appeal being refused: [...] "n 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Service to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Service, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained." [...] Hodgson, who was at that time in the prison hospital, became more seriously ill, his solicitor was unable to take further instructions, and the line of inquiry was closed.|$|E
500|$|Wise's {{trial for}} murder began on May 4, 1925. [...] She was {{represented}} by Joseph Pritchard and prosecuted by Joseph Seymour. Defense claims included that Wise was criminally insane {{and that she was}} ordered to commit the murders by her former lover, Walter Johns. A number of setbacks plagued the defense, including the May 6 suicide of Wise's sister-in-law, Edith Hasel, and the subsequent collapse of her husband Fred Hasel, both of whom had been prepared to testify for the defense; the recantation of testimony by a man named Frank Metzger, who told the prosecution on cross-examination that the defense had asked him to perjure himself to support claims that Wise was insane; and Wise's choice to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> on her own behalf. Family members including Wise's son, Lester, and three of the Gienkes' children testified against her.|$|E

500|$|Despite a weak start, {{with opening}} witness Anthony Gilberti unable to {{recognize}} Massino in the courtroom, the prosecution would establish its case to link Massino with the {{charges in the}} indictment through an unprecedented seven major turncoats, including the six turned made men. Vitale, {{the last of the}} six to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand,</b> was of particular significance. [...] He had spent most of his three decades in the Mafia as a close confidant to Massino, and his closeness to his brother in law allowed him to cover Massino's entire criminal history in his testimony. Brietbart's defense rested primarily on cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, with his only witness being an FBI agent to challenge Vitale's reliability. His defense was also unusual in that he made no attempt to contest that Massino was the Bonanno boss, instead stressing the murders in the case took place before he took over and that Massino himself [...] "showed a love of life...because the murders ceased." ...|$|E
500|$|Still, Achebe {{seeks to}} portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: [...] "I never will <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> that the Old must win {{or that the}} New must win. The point is that no single truth {{satisfied}} me—and this is well founded in the Ibo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct." [...] His perspective {{is reflected in the}} words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: [...] "whatever you are is never enough; you {{must find a way to}} accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism." [...] And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: [...] "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness." ...|$|E
500|$|The illicit {{activity}} that caused Daugherty the most problems was a Smith deal with Colonel Thomas W. Miller, a former Delaware congressman, whom Harding had appointed Alien Property Custodian. Smith and Miller received a payoff of {{almost half a}} million dollars for getting a German-owned firm, the American Metal Company, released to new U.S. owners. Smith deposited $50,000 in a joint account with Daugherty, used for political purposes. Records relating to that account were destroyed by Daugherty and his brother. Miller and Daugherty were indicted for defrauding the government. The first trial, in September 1926, resulted in a hung jury; at the second, early in 1927, Miller was convicted and served prison time, but the jury again hung as to Daugherty. Though charges against Daugherty were then dropped, and he was never convicted of any offense, his refusal to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in his own defense devastated what was left of his reputation. The former Attorney General remained defiant, blaming his troubles on his enemies in the labor movement and on the Communists, and wrote that he had [...] "done nothing that prevents my looking the whole world in the face".|$|E

500|$|Hashimoto spoke {{first with}} judge {{advocate}} Captain Thomas J. Ryan {{for four hours}} on 11 December. He spoke {{the next day with}} Captain John P. Cady, McVay's chief defense counsel, for several hours, as both officers sought to determine his credibility and competence to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> in the trial. He told them the visibility was good {{on the night of the}} attack and he had been able to easily spot the Indianapolis. Hashimoto testified in the court on 13 December in a crowded courtroom. It was the first time that an officer of a nation at war with the United States had testified against an officer of the U.S. Navy in a court martial. At the behest of Cady, Hashimoto took both a Japanese civil oath and an U.S. Navy oath so he could be charged for perjury in both nations if he lied. Hashimoto's 50 minutes of testimony focused on whether or not Indianapolis was [...] "zigzagging" [...] and he noted the ship did not deviate from its course. However, he also noted that, due to his position, such evasive maneuvers would not have diminished his ability to attack the ship. Still, his testimony is considered integral in McVay's eventual conviction that he had been negligent. Charles Butler McVay III was exonerated in 2001. Following his appearance at the trial, Hashimoto remained in U.S. custody under guard until early 1946, when he was returned to Japan aboard [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{obscenity}} {{trial began}} on 9 November 1928. Cape's solicitor Harold Rubinstein sent out 160 letters to potential witnesses. Many {{were reluctant to}} appear in court; according to Virginia Woolf, [...] "they generally put {{it down to the}} weak heart of a father, or a cousin who is about to have twins". About 40 turned up {{on the day of the}} trial, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such diverse figures as biologist Julian Huxley, Laurence Housman of the British Sexological Society, Robert Cust JP of the London Morality Council, Charles Ricketts of the Royal Academy of Art and Rabbi Joseph Frederick Stern of the East London Synagogue. Norman Haire, who was the star witness after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about syphilis. None were allowed to offer their views of the novel. Under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron could decide whether the book was obscene without hearing any testimony on the question. [...] "I don't think people are entitled to express an opinion upon a matter which is the decision of the court," [...] he said. Since Hall herself was not on trial, she did not have the right to her own counsel, and Cape's barrister Norman Birkett had persuaded her not to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> herself.|$|E
500|$|In essence the Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause does not protect a defendant's refusal to answer {{questions}} asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights. In the concrete case the court issued the following holding: When petitioner {{had not yet been}} placed in custody or received Miranda warnings, and voluntarily responded to some questions by police about a murder, the prosecution's use of his silence in response to another question as evidence of his guilty at trial did not violate the Fifth Amendment because petitioner failed to expressly invoke his privilege not to incriminate himself in response to the officer's question. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection. This requirement ensures that the government is put on notice when a defendant intends to claim this privilege and allows the government to either argue that the testimony is not self-incriminating or offer immunity. The plurality opinion of Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy reiterated two exceptions to this principle: 1) that a criminal defendant does not need to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> at trial in order to explicitly claim this privilege; and 2) that failure to claim this privilege must be excused when that failure was due to government coercion. The plurality opinion declined to extend these exceptions to the situation in Salinas v. Texas. Notwithstanding popular misconceptions, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not establish a complete right to remain silent but only guarantees that criminal defendant may not be forced to testify against himself or herself. Therefore, as long as police do not deprive defendants of the opportunity to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, there is no Constitutional violation. The Court stated that there was no [...] "ritualistic formula" [...] necessary to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, but that a person could not do so [...] "by simply standing mute." [...] If an individual fails to invoke his right, and is later charged with a crime, the prosecution may use his silence at trial as evidence of his guilt.|$|E
