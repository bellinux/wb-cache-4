2500|$|The {{premise of}} Mille Bornes {{is that the}} players are in a road race. [...] Each race—or hand—is usually 700 miles (or kilometers) long, but {{the first player to}} {{complete}} that distance exactly has the option to declare an extension in which case the race becomes 1,000 miles. Other times the game is played up to 1000 miles first, and then the first player to complete that distance has the option to declare an [...] "extension" [...] for 1,200 miles. Mille Bornes is played with a special deck of cards. There are hazard, remedy, safety, and distance cards. Each hazard is corrected by a corresponding remedy, and is actually prevented from happening in the first place by a corresponding safety. The <b>target</b> <b>distance</b> is reached by playing distance cards.|$|E

60|$|Not so {{with the}} Pathfinder: his hardy self-devotion had brought him into a {{situation}} of unusual exposure, the hazards of which were much increased by the fact that, just as he drifted nearest to the enemy the party on the shore rushed down the bank and joined their friends who still stood in the water.

30|$|Based on {{the above}} reasoning, in the {{discrete}} task we predicted to observe fixed-point dynamics under all conditions. Under the distance manipulation, for low ID, the (average) velocity {{can be expected}} to be very low. We therefore expected to find indications for the existence of a driven fixed-point scenario. For the cyclic task, in line with previous findings we predicted to observe a bifurcation from a limit cycle dynamics to a fixed-point dynamics with decreasing target width [17]. Finally, we expected to find evidence either for a limit cycle dynamics or the driven fixed-point at small <b>target</b> <b>distances</b> and time-invariant fixed points at large <b>target</b> <b>distances.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} a corrected {{control surface angle}} for use in single viewpoint photogrammetry to correct control surface angle measurements affected by wing bending. First and second visual targets are spaced apart &om one another on a control surface of an aircraft wing. The targets are positioned at a semispan distance along the aircraft wing. A reference <b>target</b> separation <b>distance</b> is determined using single viewpoint photogrammetry for a "wind off condition. An apparent <b>target</b> separation <b>distance</b> is then computed for "wind on. " The difference between the reference and apparent <b>target</b> separation <b>distances</b> is minimized by recomputing the single viewpoint photogrammetric solution for incrementally changed values of <b>target</b> semispan <b>distances.</b> A final single viewpoint photogrammetric solution is then generated that uses the corrected semispan distance that produced the minimized difference between the reference and apparent <b>target</b> separation <b>distances.</b> The final single viewpoint photogrammetric solution set is {{used to determine the}} corrected control surface angle...|$|R

5000|$|FM bats produce short pulses, {{often less}} than 5 ms in duration, that contain {{a broad range}} of {{frequencies}} covering up to 80-100 kHz. [...] Bats use FM pulses to determine <b>target</b> <b>distance,</b> by using the delay between multiple emitted pulses and their returning echoes to calculate range. [...] In CF-FM bats, a short, upward FM sweep precedes the long, CF component of the pulse. The pulse is then terminated with a short, downward FM sweep. Bats that produce these types of compound signals still use the DSC to modulate the frequency of the returning echoes, due to the CF component of the pulse. These pulses are best suited for the precise determination of <b>target</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

An unpredictable startling acoustic stimulus (124 dB) replaced the imperative stimulus in certain trials. The authors verified the presence of a startle response independent from the prepared response by observing electromyographic (EMG) activity in sternocleidomastoid and orbicularis oculi muscles. Findings indicated that when the participant was startled, the intended voluntary response was produced at significantly shorter response latencies. Furthermore, the kinematic variables of the observed response during startle trials for all 3 <b>target</b> <b>distances</b> were mostly unchanged.
