5|$|Akira Uehara {{volunteers to}} deliver {{homework}} to Nanako Momoi, his classmate and crush. At Nanako's home, her grandfather's invention causes Akira and Nanako to exchange bodies; the invention is destroyed shortly after its use. Nanako is <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exchange as it complements her tomboy personality; she begins dating her friend Makoto Shiina. Meanwhile, Akira's effeminate personality combined with Nanako's beauty garners the courtship of his friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, to his discomfort.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up {{to buy one}} of his own, but because of his poor credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. <b>Thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's suggestion to turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness.|$|E

5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
5|$|With {{some members}} working as dishwashers, {{the group was}} {{apparently}} not <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album being released on Ward 9. Terry Tolkin, a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent Touch and Go Records in Detroit. Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac was released in 1984. Building on their first EP, the band made psychedelia a much bigger part of their sound on this release, which made full use of the tape editing, non-traditional instrumentation, and sound modulation that came to define their studio recordings.|$|E
5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E
60|$|And {{while you}} are looking, across upon the Castle Hill, the drums and bugles begin to recall the {{scattered}} garrison; <b>the</b> air <b>thrills</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sound; the bugles sing aloud; and the last rising flourish mounts and melts into the darkness like a star: a martial swan-song, fitly rounding in the labours of the day.|$|R
60|$|Salome pictured him so, {{with his}} long, curling lashes {{brushing}} his rosy, tear-stained cheek and his chubby fists clasped tightly over his breast {{as was his}} habit; her heart grew warm and <b>thrilling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> maternity the picture provoked.|$|R
5000|$|This EP {{features}} {{five different}} songs in total, with nine remixes {{of them and}} one B-Side. Even though it's S.E.X. Appeal's fourth album, released in 2010, it features only content recorded from 1996 and 1998, the first four singles, [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi", [...] "Life Goes Up, Life Goes Down" [...] and [...] "Dirty Talk", which didn't appear on their debut album Peeping Tom or any of their previous albums before for unknown reasons and [...] "Sex is a <b>Thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pill", which appeared on Peeping Tom. All the official remixes of these four singles have been included, even the B-Side of [...] "Sex is a <b>Thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pill", the reggae fusion driven song called [...] "Power of Love", excluding three singles' official instrumental versions.|$|R
5|$|The Grameen Bank {{encourages}} {{its members}} to create a positive impact by becoming {{actively involved in the}} politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were surprised to find that borrowers were <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received more women voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only did more women participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.|$|E

Franklin, the boss, who had always run his own company, being told by a bank employee how to engineer and assemble the company's newest model.|$|E
25|$|In {{his free}} time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric pig, Elotherium, whose fossilized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy, and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of watercolors to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued {{to work with the}} museum well into the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world’s most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.|$|E

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
25|$|Viki {{surprisingly}} {{manages to}} pass her theater audition, though it's obvious {{the reason for}} the sudden success is jury member Baron being taken with her attractive looks. Though she's ecstatic, Filip is not <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development and is especially unhappy about the celebrated theater actor and multiple divorcee Baron now wooing his girlfriend, with Viki even welcoming the aging lothario's smooth advances. Frustrated, Filip even contacts Ema hoping to receive some help getting through to Viki whose head is high in the clouds. For the moment at least, Giga and Ema manage to impart some rationality to their daughter, and she seems ready to take the sensible option and make nice with Filip. In parallel, in order to sweeten his case with Viki, Baron arranges for her, a complete novice, to get the demanding role of Juliet in the theater's latest production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while Baron plays Romeo. He tells her the big news by showing up unannounced at the apartment just as she's getting ready to go out to meet Filip for a date. The news sends her on cloud nine and she immediately puts Filip and the marriage on the back-burner while Filip's frustration grows. Soon, Baron manages to bed Viki who thus becomes his latest conquest. Though he's not aware of the gory details yet, Filip has seen enough to send him over the edge and, overcome with jealousy, he constantly interrupts their rehearsals. It all culminates in an act of madness as he breaks into Baron's apartment with a gun, threatening to kill him, but the verbose actor talks him out of it using a combination of pointed eloquence and dramatic flair.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter-producer Clif Magness, {{who gave her}} ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote [...] "Losing Grip" [...] and [...] "Unwanted", songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album. However, Arista was not <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.|$|E
5000|$|Peeping Tom it is {{the first}} album by German eurodance/trance project S.E.X. Appeal. The album was {{released}} 1999 and spawned the four singles [...] "Sex is a <b>thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pill", [...] "Hanky Spanky", [...] "Manga maniac" [...] and [...] "Kids in America", a Kim Wilde cover, the latter labeled as Lyane Leigh only. The song Fragile love has been released in a remixed version seven years later in 2006 and appeared on the second studio album Sensuality.|$|R

60|$|Aside {{from the}} {{doubtful}} question of authorship, even a casual {{reading of the}} poem brings us into {{the presence of a}} poet rude indeed, but with a genius strongly suggestive at times of the matchless Milton. <b>The</b> book opens <b>with</b> a hymn of praise, and then tells of the fall of Satan and his rebel angels from heaven, which is familiar to us in Milton's Paradise Lost. Then follows the creation of the world, and the Paraphrase begins to <b>thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old Anglo-Saxon love of nature.|$|R
500|$|Selman {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} result of the episode. He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually very exciting, and I'm super <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar kind of guy who doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|At the amfAR gala {{during the}} 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Stefani {{auctioned}} off the lacy black dress she wore {{at the event}} for charity, raising over $125,000. The dress sparked controversy after a representative for designer Michael Angel—who helped Stefani with the design {{and worked as a}} stylist—alleged that it was Angel who created the gown, not Stefani. In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala, adding, [...] "I'm disappointed that the focus has shifted away from what Gwen and I originally intended, which was to create a custom outfit for a great cause. We both were <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome and enjoyed the process. I have nothing but respect for her and look forward to working with her on more projects in the future." [...] Stefani hosted a fundraiser with First Lady Michelle Obama in August 2012 at the singer's Beverly Hills home.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitutional}} {{position of}} Sophie, Anne's mother, became difficult after Frederick's death in 1588, {{when she found}} herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne herself seems to have been <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler reported that Anne was [...] "so far in love with the King's Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt in no way to requite." [...] Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fiancé while three hundred tailors worked on her wedding dress.|$|E

Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth it shall be glad. Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our agelong love. Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! We are one; we are none."Instructions were given to one of Aleister Crowley's successors to include a new line between {{the fourth and fifth}} lines. This line was to be added at a specified time after Aleister Crowley's death. The line reads: [...] "One's death is a gift to Life!" [...] The completed verse then reads: [...] "Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! <b>Thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> joy of life & death! Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth it shall be Glad. One's death is a gift to Life! Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our agelong love. Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice!

Now and then a hilarious laugh bursts from a group of children, or a hymn rises from some grateful heart, for as yet there is no secular music in Ratinga! ...|$|R
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I was <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot. I know {{it moved}} very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Adam Finley {{said the}} episode [...] "manages {{to be both}} {{incredibly}} funny and incredibly touching, both signs of a great Simpsons episode". He added that [...] "the episode has some great gags in it, but the emotion is very real, too. Homer is not <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of having a}} baby, and the episode does a wonderful job of showing the dark side of having another mouth to feed." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD: [...] "Flashback episodes of The Simpsons usually work well, and [...] is no exception to that rule. Actually, at this point it’s one of my favorites, but that’s partially because of overexposure to some of the other episodes. In any case, this one has many hilarious moments – such as the scene that explains Homer's hair loss." [...] Kevin Wong at PopMatters said the episode is [...] "a touching look at fatherhood".|$|E
500|$|Hepburn's second {{film was}} Christopher Strong (1933), {{the story of}} an aviator and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal American that {{although}} her mannerisms were grating, [...] "they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality." [...] Hepburn's third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace—a role intended for Constance Bennett—in Morning Glory, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers. Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony—as she would not for the duration of her career—but was <b>thrilled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> win. Her success continued with the role of Jo in the film Little Women (1933). The picture was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. Little Women was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, [...] "I defy anyone to be as good [...] as I was".|$|E
60|$|Aurelia rode home in perplexity, much {{afraid of}} the {{combustibles}} at her girdle, and hating the task her sister had forced on her. She felt as if her heedless avowals had been high treason to her husband; and yet Harriet was her elder, and those assurances that as a true woman she was bound to clear up the mystery, made her cheeks burn with shame, and her heart <b>thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> determination to vindicate her husband, while the longing to know the face of one who so loved her was freshly awakened.|$|R
60|$|There {{was to be}} {{one more}} scene in the brief and cruel drama which he had devised for the hoodwinking and final {{spoliation}} of a young and inexperienced girl. She had {{earlier in the day}} been placed in possession of all the negotiable part of her fortune. This, though by no means representing the whole of her wealth, which also lay in landed estates, was nevertheless of such magnitude that the thought of its possession caused every fiber in Sir Marmaduke's body to <b>thrill</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> delight of expectancy.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a picture}} he looked at often, and the more he looked the greater was his desire, to see Frona Welse again. This event he {{anticipated}} <b>with</b> a <b>thrill,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exultancy over change which is common of all life. She was something new, a fresh type, a woman unrelated to all women he had met. Out of the fascinating unknown a pair of hazel eyes smiled into his, and a hand, soft of touch and strong of grip, beckoned him. And there was an allurement about it which was as the allurement of sin.|$|R
