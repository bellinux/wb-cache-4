5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Wheelhouses are stone {{buildings}} {{from the}} later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which {{a circle of}} stone piers (bearing a resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> of a wheel) {{form the basis for}} lintel arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
50|$|For bicycle <b>spokes,</b> <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> {{length is}} defined from the flange {{seat to the}} thread tip. For spokes with bent ends, <b>the</b> nominal <b>spoke</b> length {{does not include the}} width of <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> at <b>the</b> bent end.|$|R
50|$|At {{one end of}} each spoke is a {{specialized}} nut, called a nipple, {{which is used to}} connect <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> to <b>the</b> rim and adjust the tension in <b>the</b> <b>spoke.</b> <b>The</b> nipple is usually located at the rim end of <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> but on some wheels is at the hub end to move its weight closer to the axis of the wheel, reducing the moment of inertia.|$|R
50|$|One {{end of each}} spoke is {{threaded}} for a specialized nut, called a nipple, {{which is used to}} connect <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> to <b>the</b> rim and adjust the tension in <b>the</b> <b>spoke.</b> This is normally at the rim end. The hub end normally has a 90 degree bend to pass through <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> hole in <b>the</b> hub, and a head so it does not slip through the hole.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spokes</b> {{were not}} {{observed}} again until some twenty-five years later, {{this time by}} the Cassini space probe. <b>The</b> <b>spokes</b> were not visible when Cassini arrived at Saturn in early 2004. Some scientists speculated that <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> would not be visible again until 2007, based on models attempting to describe their formation. Nevertheless, the Cassini imaging team kept looking for spokes in images of the rings, and they were next seen in images taken on 5 September 2005.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spokes</b> {{appear to}} be a {{seasonal}} phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter and midsummer and reappearing as Saturn comes closer to equinox. Suggestions that <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> may be a seasonal effect, varying with Saturn's 29.7-year orbit, were supported by their gradual reappearance in the later years of the Cassini mission.|$|E
25|$|Radiating out of Downtown Dallas' freeway loop are <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> of the area's highway system—Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, U.S. Highway 75, U.S. Highway 175, State Spur 366, the Dallas North Tollway, State Highway 114, U.S. Highway 80, and U.S. Highway 67. Other major {{highways}} {{around the}} city include State Highway 183 and State Spur 408.|$|E
50|$|In action <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> {{was forced}} down, against {{the tension of}} twisted ropes or other springs, by a windlass, and then {{suddenly}} released. <b>The</b> <b>spoke</b> thus kicked <b>the</b> crosspiece of the vertical frame, and the projectile at its extreme end was shot forward.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum rims {{are often}} {{reinforced}} with either single eyelets or double eyelets {{to distribute the}} stress of <b>the</b> <b>spoke.</b> A single eyelet reinforces <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> hole much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.|$|R
5000|$|Radial spokes are T-shaped {{structures}} present inside <b>the</b> axoneme. Each <b>spoke</b> {{consists of}} a [...] "head" [...] and a [...] "stalk," [...] while each of these sub-structures is itself made up of many protein subunits. In all, <b>the</b> radial <b>spoke</b> is known to contain at least 17 different proteins, with 5 located {{in the head and}} at least 12 making up <b>the</b> stalk. <b>The</b> <b>spoke</b> stalk binds to the A-tubule of each microtubule outer doublet, and <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> head faces in towards the center of the axoneme (see illustration at right).|$|R
25|$|Until 1980, the {{structure}} of the rings of Saturn was explained as being caused exclusively by the action of gravitational forces. Then images from the Voyager spacecraft showed radial features in the B ring, known as spokes, which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings was not consistent with gravitational orbital mechanics. <b>The</b> <b>spokes</b> appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light (see images in Gallery); the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60°. The leading theory regarding the spokes' composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by electrostatic repulsion, as they rotate almost synchronously with the magnetosphere of Saturn. The precise mechanism generating <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> is still unknown, although {{it has been suggested that}} the electrical disturbances might be caused by either lightning bolts in Saturn's atmosphere or micrometeoroid impacts on the rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} had seven wings, at {{the centre of}} which a tower served as the intersection and was used by guards to keep watch on the inmates; this format was based on Jeremy Bentham's idea of the Panopticon. The wings radiated from the tower in straight lines, much like <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> of a bicycle wheel. A large bell was kept in the tower to raise an alarm.|$|E
25|$|The {{cross product}} {{can be used}} to {{calculate}} the normal for a triangle or polygon, an operation frequently performed in computer graphics. For example, the winding of a polygon (clockwise or anticlockwise) about a point within the polygon can be calculated by triangulating the polygon (like spoking a wheel) and summing the angles (between <b>the</b> <b>spokes)</b> using the cross product {{to keep track of the}} sign of each angle.|$|E

25|$|The {{core group}} is logically a ring, but is {{superimposed}} on an inner hub-and-spoke structure of ideological authority. Each {{member of the}} core forms another hub and spoke system (see infrastructure cells), <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> leading to infrastructure cells {{under the supervision of}} the core group member, and possibly to operational groups which the headquarters support. Note that in this organization, there is a point at which the operational cell becomes autonomous of the core. Members surviving the operation may rejoin at various points.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — For {{wireless}} sensor networks {{with many}} location-unaware nodes, we investigate a protocol, dubbed BeSpoken, that steers data transmissions along a straight path called a <b>spoke.</b> <b>The</b> protocol directs data transmissions by randomly selecting relays to retransmit data packets from crescent-shaped areas along <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> axis. <b>The</b> packet retransmission by the selected relay constitutes a <b>spoke</b> hop. <b>The</b> current <b>spoke</b> direction at any given hop may deviate from <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> axis. In this work, we model the current direction as a Markov Modulated Random Walk, and offer protocol design guidelines which ensure that the deviation is limited...|$|R
50|$|Spoke nipples are {{typically}} T-shaped in cross section, with an internal thread running {{part of the}} way through the hole that runs along <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> nipple's principal axis. A spoke nipple rests in a hole drilled radially through the wheel's rim, and the nipple is threaded onto the external thread of a <b>spoke.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spoke</b> itself is fixed, at its other end, through a hole in <b>the</b> hub. <b>The</b> <b>spoke</b> and nipple are functionally equivalent to a bolt and a nut. However, unlike a typical nut-and-bolt pair, a spoke and nipple do not join two parts (the rim and the hub) so much as bridge them, under tension.|$|R

25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back {{pedalling}} and got off {{and walked down}} steep hills, but most also used a brake. Having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars, although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills. Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in <b>the</b> <b>spokes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{system to}} {{synthesise}} the solar anomaly {{is very similar}} to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the sun spindle, the second fixed on one of <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean sun wheel turns.|$|E

40|$|A protocol, dubbed BeSpoken, steers data {{transmissions}} along {{a straight}} path called a spoke through a {{wireless sensor network}} with many location-unaware nodes. BeSpoken implements a simple, spatially recursive communication process, where a set of control packets and a data packet are exchanged among daisy-chained re-lays that constitute <b>the</b> <b>spoke.</b> It directs data transmissions by ran-domly selecting relays from crescent-shaped areas along <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> axis created by intersecting transmission ranges of control and data packets. To specify design rules for protocol parameters that min-imize energy consumption while ensuring that spokes propagate far enough and have a limited wobble with respect to <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> axis, our model of <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> propagation matches <b>the</b> protocol pa-rameters to the density of network nodes, assuming that nodes are spatially distributed as a Poisson point process of known uniform intensity. To avoid this requirement, we propose and characterize an adaptive mechanism that ensures desired spoke propagation in a network of arbitrary density. This necessitates a qualitatively new protocol model used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> propagation under both the basic and the adaptive protocol. The introduced adaptive mech-anism repairs <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> when <b>the</b> crescent-shaped area is empty which may occur {{in the case of}} network thinning {{and as a result of}} random or arbitrary sensor death. Our analytical and simula-tion results demonstrate that the adaptive BeSpoken creates longer spokes both in networks with uniform distribution of nodes and in networks with holes. In addition, the adaptive protocol is signifi-cantly less sensitive to changes in the distribution of network nodes and their density...|$|R
