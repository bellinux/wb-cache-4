5|$|Smith {{left the}} Ravens' hotel on Sunday at 2 a.m. ET, {{accompanied}} {{by a member of}} the Ravens' security staff, to be with his family. Smith told Ravens coach John Harbaugh that he wanted to play in that night's game against the New England Patriots. Harbaugh <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Smith's call to make. Smith chose to play, and finished the game with 6 receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-30 win over the New England Patriots.|$|E
5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Invited to the Canucks {{training}} camp, Bourdon {{almost made}} {{the team as}} an 18-year-old, but instead was returned to the QMJHL for further development. He began the 2005–06 season with the Foreurs, registering 20 points in 20 games, before being traded to the Moncton Wildcats, who were hosting the 2006 Memorial Cup. In exchange for Bourdon, the Wildcats sent Ian Mathieu-Girard, Jean-Sébastien Adam, a fourth-round pick, and a first-round selection in 2008 to Val-d'Or. Shortly after the trade, Bourdon injured his ankle, suffering a fractured fibula, high and low sprains, and a second-degree ligament tear. Although he returned to join Moncton in the playoffs, doctors <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would take two years to fully recover. He managed a full recovery after one year, but his turning ability and backwards skating sometimes lagged. Competing in the Memorial Cup, he reached the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) final with the Wildcats, who lost 6–2 to the Quebec Remparts.|$|E
50|$|Brian finds Stewie in a toilet, {{where he}} {{says one of the}} Teds <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> where a piece of crap has to live. Brian coaxes him to stop them and they reconcile. Stewie tries to short them out with lemonade. But when he is unsure about outsmarting them, Brian steps in and shorts them out with a hose.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Snapper and Greg tried {{desperately to}} get Mr. Foster on an early plane to Arizona as his {{condition}} was worsening. He agreed, but changed his mind when he finally learned of Jill's arrangement with Katherine. He hastened to the hospital where he confronted Katherine and Jill. Jill <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> too late. She's signed the papers and accepted the million dollar check. He begged her {{to get out of}} the deal. Whatever time he has left to live, he wants to spend with his grandson and nothing is more important to the baby than its mother's love.|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I thought <b>it</b> {{would be}} right to do so--that I was {{thoroughly}} convinced it would be, since he felt it to be right.|$|R
25|$|In August 1972, Clough {{refused to}} go on an {{arranged}} pre-season tour of the Netherlands and West Germany unless he could take his family with him. Derby chairman Sam Longson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a working trip and not a holiday, so Clough put Taylor {{in charge of the}} tour instead and {{refused to go}}. The club did not contest the FA Charity Shield that year.|$|E
25|$|Providence founder Roger Williams {{was brought}} to the top of Sugarloaf Hill in nearby Wakefield when {{treating}} with the Narragansett tribe. They pointed toward this large settlement and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was called Nanihigonset. This site is now believed {{to be the center of}} the Narragansett geography, where they coalesced as a tribe and began to extend their dominion over the neighboring tribes at different points in history.|$|E
25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, when she thought the cameras were off, she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was, in fact, self-defense, but she could not stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E
60|$|When he {{broached}} the subject again, two days later, Theodosia <b>told</b> <b>him</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was no use. She would never consent to leave Heatherton {{and all her}} friends and {{go out to the}} prairies. The idea was just rank foolishness, and he would soon see that himself.|$|R

"Indeed, sir," [...] said Fanny, [...] "I am {{very sorry}} that Mr. Crawford should {{continue}} to know <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is paying me a very great compliment, and I feel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> never will be in my power--" ...|$|R
25|$|Menéndez feared Ribault would return, attack his fleet {{while he}} was unloading, and perhaps capture the San Pelayo, which carried the major part of his {{supplies}} and ammunition; he was also anxious to send two of his sloops back to Havana for reinforcements. For these reasons the unloading was pushed rapidly forward. In the meantime he strengthened his position, and sought what information he could obtain of {{the situation of the}} French fort from the Indians. They <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be reached from the head of the harbor of St. Augustine, without going by sea, probably indicating a way by North River and Pablo Creek.|$|E
25|$|Pang De {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in chapter 58 as a trusted general under Ma Teng. At that time, Ma Teng had left Liang Province and travelled to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while Ma Chao remained in the province. One night, Ma Chao had a dream about being attacked by a pack of tigers in a snowy land so he consulted his subordinates about it. Pang De <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was not a good}} omen. Later, Ma Chao received news that his father Ma Teng was lured into a trap in Xu and had been killed by Cao Cao's men. This led to the Battle of Tong Pass, but in the novel, the order of events related to the battle had been reversed and some fictional stories were included.|$|E
25|$|Every party {{except the}} gunshop attacking group {{gathered}} at the Matsue broadcasting station. They requested the station to broadcast their message of uprising but the station master rejected the request. The station was surrounded by 50 armed policemen and 20 soldiers. Okazaki declared {{that he and his}} group were patriots, that the Japanese forces had betrayed them, and that their enemies were traitors. A top Civil Secret Policeman whom Okazaki knew urged negotiations for fear of a gun battle. Okazaki finally surrendered on condition that their party be acquitted, except for himself. Okazaki proposed that all should bow in the direction of Tokyo and all of them present then shouted, Tennō Heika Banzai (Hail to the Emperor). The armed party members went to the Matsue Police Station without any restriction, and then entered the Japanese fencing gym of the police station while Okazaki and the special police chief negotiated. The police chief withdrew his offer made during the previous negotiation since the prosecutor now <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to release the members. Okazaki protested, but had to accept the situation. Issuing his last message to the members, he attempted seppuku on the abdomen and neck. He was sent unconscious to Matsue Red Cross hospital and survived. All members were investigated at the police station on suspicion of wartime rioting, invasion without permission, postal and gas service obstruction, and violation of rules on explosives. The female members were released the next day and the other members, except for the leaders of each team, were released two days later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} itself is an attraction, an open cylinder elevated on four massive [...] "legs," [...] {{with a large}} fountain occupying the central courtyard. Before architect Gordon Bunshaft designed the building, the Smithsonian staff reportedly <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>it</b> did not provide a striking contrast to {{everything else in the}} city, then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection.|$|R
60|$|So, when to-morrow came, I {{went to my}} {{guardian}} after breakfast, in {{the room}} that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I had <b>it</b> in trust to tell him something.|$|R
5000|$|The people taunted Shuʿayb and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> were <b>it</b> not for {{the prestigious}} family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuʿayb replied, [...] "Is my family of more {{consideration}} with you than God?" [...] When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur'an, however, mentions that Shuʿayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.|$|R
500|$|Columbus {{repeatedly}} {{checked with}} Rowling {{to make sure}} he was getting minor details correct. Kloves described the film as being [...] "really faithful" [...] to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth Harry Potter novel Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.|$|E
500|$|Lee Byung-hun as Thomas Arashikage / Storm Shadow [...] Snake Eyes' rival; {{both were}} close {{members of the}} Arashikage ninja clan. Lee was {{unfamiliar}} with G.I. Joe because the franchise is unknown in South Korea, but Sommers and di Bonaventura <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not necessary to watch the cartoons {{to prepare for the}} role. Lee was attracted to Storm Shadow's [...] "dual personality," [...] which he stated has [...] "huge pride and honor." ...|$|E
500|$|Wire {{described}} [...] "Revol" [...] {{as being}} about Edwards' idea that [...] "relationships in politics, and relationships in general, are failures". [...] "P.C.P.", he said, was about how [...] "PC followers {{take up the}} idea of being liberal but end up being quite the opposite". He said that he was [...] "completely confused" [...] by [...] "Faster" [...] (most of which he had written), although Edwards had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was about self-abuse.|$|E

500|$|Loudspeakers {{broadcast}} the performance {{throughout the city}} {{as well as to}} the German forces in a move of psychological warfare, a [...] "tactical strike against German morale". One German soldier recalled how his squadron [...] "listened to the symphony of heroes". Eliasberg later met with some of the Germans who camped outside Leningrad during the performance, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had made them believe they would never capture the city: [...] "Who are we bombing? We will never be able to take Leningrad because the people here are selfless".|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{inspected}} the PT boat squadron on 1 March. With air cover provided by his four remaining Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, MacArthur {{and his wife}} Jean took a half-hour ride on PT-41. Although the sea was tranquil, Jean still felt queasy. Ostensibly, the purpose of MacArthur's visit was presenting Bulkeley with the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking an [...] "unidentified 5,000-ton enemy ship with torpedoes without serious damage to his ship or casualty to his crew", but afterwards MacArthur took Bulkeley aside {{and asked him if}} {{it would be possible to}} make the [...] journey through uncharted waters at night in PT boats. Bulkeley <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be [...] "a piece of cake." ...|$|E
500|$|Salah then lobbied the Jordanian {{government}} to extend these regions into {{other parts of}} Jordan. Government officials were lukewarm to the idea and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be [...] "naive to assume" [...] that the United States would give Jordan this status. Unfazed by this response, Salah traveled to the United States and lobbied hard with the US State Department, the White House, and the US Trade Representative {{that it was in}} US interests to extend the QIZ into Jordan's interiors. Lawyers in the United States then told Salah that even if a small portion of Israeli territory was associated with a QIZ, the proposal might materialize. Soon, USTR officials began to travel to Jordan to work on the deal.|$|E

500|$|John Diefenbaker {{had been}} {{interested}} in politics from an early age, and told his mother {{at the age of}} eight or nine that he would some day be Prime Minister. She <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John's first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, [...] "I can't waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work." [...] The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.|$|E
500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would probably be the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Griffin family {{watching}} television. A commercial for local auditions of the syndicated game show Family Feud is shown, prompting {{them to try}} out the next day. The Griffins are chosen for the show and reach the final round. During a fight with Richard Dawson about welching on the prize money, Peter hits his head. This causes him to forget everything about his life, including his family and friends. Lois tries to jog his memory by reintroducing him to his old self, including his children and his sex life. Unfortunately, this causes Peter to believe that he's free to {{have sexual relations with}} others in his newfound [...] "bachelorhood." [...] Lois had earlier <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is inappropriate to have sex with his children - in response, Meg attempts an incest joke ("Well, I wish you would've told him that BEFORE he lost his memory!"). Most of the family lambaste her for this and Chris kicks her out of the room. Deeply angered, Lois decides to move out, taking the kids. When Quagmire finds out, he jumps on the opportunity to pursue a relationship with Lois.|$|E

60|$|He {{went home}} {{for a short time}} after leaving the University, but his stay there was {{productive}} of pleasure to neither his father nor himself. They had not a single taste in common, and though Cuthbert made an effort to take an interest in field sports and farming, it was not long before his father himself <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> as <b>it</b> was evident the life was altogether distasteful to him, and his tastes lay in another direction, he was perfectly ready to make <b>him</b> an allowance <b>that</b> would enable <b>him</b> either to travel or to live in chambers in London.|$|R
50|$|In October 1953, I {{was up in}} the Canadian Rockies, {{supervising the}} {{drilling}} of an oil well. Although my family were in good health and good spirits and I was making good money, I was deeply depressed and worried.
