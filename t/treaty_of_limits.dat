50|$|The border, {{at least}} in its {{terrestrial}} part, was essentially demarcated by two treaties: the Spanish Award of Queen Maria Cristina of 1891 and the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits</b> and River Navigation of 1941. But the conflict still exists by the definition of border in the Gulf of Venezuela, and it still causes diplomatic clashes between both countries.|$|E

50|$|In 1919 the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles <b>limited</b> Germany's army to 100,000 {{troops and}} so the breed's focus was again turned to {{producing}} horses suitable to farm duties. For this purpose, sires of heavier conformation (build) were used, the most successful being Ararad, Dampfross, Hyperion, Pythagoras and Tempelhüter. These stallions, while refined, possessed much substance and bone. Their influence is still seen on the modern Trakehner.|$|R
50|$|The treaty {{remained}} in full effect for only 183 days: from 22 February 1821 to 24 August 1821 when Spain signed the Treaty of Córdoba acknowledging {{the independence of}} Mexico.

50|$|However, {{when the}} U.S. {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the Republic of Texas in 1836, Mexico regarded it as a violation of the Treaty of Limits; this sentiment was made worse by the 1846 annexation of Texas, which led to the Mexican-American War. After the war, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established a new boundary between the two countries and thereby replaced the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles <b>limited</b> the Reichswehr to only 84 light field howitzers, with 800 {{rounds of}} {{ammunition}} per gun. The leFH 16 remained the standard German howitzer until 1937, when the 10.5 cm leFH 18 began to replace them in the artillery battalions. Guns turned over to Belgium as reparations after World War I were taken into German Army service after the conquest of Belgium as the 10.5 cm leFH 327 (b).|$|R
500|$|All three {{ships were}} reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> 1922 <b>limited</b> the {{signatory}} nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped.

50|$|The {{treaty was}} {{ratified}} by Spain in 1820, {{and by the}} United States in 1821 (during the time that Spain and Mexico were engaged in the prolonged Mexican War of Independence). Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the Treaty of Córdoba signed on August 24, 1821.

50|$|After {{a dispute}} over the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty and the related 1828 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits,</b> the governments of both the United States {{and the state of}} Texas claimed {{ownership}} of some 1.5 million acres (6,000 km²) in what was then operated as Greer County, Texas.

25|$|The Washington Naval <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> 1922 <b>limited</b> all <b>of</b> the number, displacement, and {{armament}} of warships built {{following its}} ratification, {{and this was}} extended by the First London Naval Treaty but these treaties were due to expire in 1936. With increased tension between Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Italy, it was supposed by the designers of these battleships that the treaty might not be renewed and the ships of the King George V class were designed with this possibility in mind.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{elements}} in the United States were displeased with the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits</b> of the Adams-Onís Treaty, and Poinsett was sent to negotiate the acquisition of new territories for the United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Upper California, as well as parts of Lower California, Sonora, Coahuila, and Nuevo León; but Poinsett's offer to purchase these areas {{was rejected by the}} Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs headed by Juan Francisco de Azcárate.

5000|$|The {{southern}} border with Brazil {{is described in}} the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits</b> of 1906 as [...] "formed from the French border French Guiana to the British border British Guiana, {{the line of the}} drainage divide (watershed) between the Amazon basin to the south, and the basins of the rivers flowing into north to the Atlantic Ocean." [...] The border described in the treaty was the result of an arbitration process that was headed by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. The treaty was signed in Rio de Janeiro on May 5, 1906. Brazil and the Netherlands both ratified the treaty in 1908.|$|E
5000|$|Costa Rica has {{sovereignty}} over the disputed territory. By excavating three caños {{and establishing a}} military presence on Costa Rican territory, Nicaragua violated the territorial sovereignty of Costa Rica. By excavating two caños in 2013 and establishing a {{military presence in the}} disputed territory, Nicaragua breached the provisional ruling issued by the Court on 8 March 2011. Furthermore, Nicaragua breached Costa Rica’s rights of navigation on the San Juan River pursuant to the 1858 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits.</b> Nicaragua has the obligation to compensate Costa Rica for material damages caused by Nicaragua’s unlawful activities on Costa Rican territory. Said compensation will be agreed upon by the parties before December 16, 2016, or, failing agreement, shall be determined by the court.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles <b>limited</b> {{the size}} and {{armament}} of the Reichsmarine and prevented it from introducing new technologies. The restrictions were intended to prevent the German Navy from becoming {{a threat to the}} Allied powers. On the other hand, the Allies had made certain that the Reichsmarine would be in the foreseeable future the strongest power in the Baltic Sea, in order to serve as a counterweight against the new Soviet Union, which was viewed with distrust by the Allies.|$|R

50|$|The Brazil-Venezuela {{border is}} the limit that {{separates}} the territories of Brazil and Venezuela. It was delimited by the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limits</b> and River Navigation of May 5, 1859 and ratified by the Protocol of 1929. The geographical boundary begins at the triple point between Brazil-Colombia-Venezuela at Cucuy Rock and continues up the Maturacá channel to the Huá waterfall; it then follows a straight line {{to the top of}} a mountain called Cerro Cupi. It then follows the crest of the drainage divide between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins up to the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela border tripoint on top of Mount Roraima, thus covering a total of 2,199 kilometres (of which 90 km are conventional boundaries and the other 2,109 km correspond to the watershed between the basins of the Amazon (Brazil) and Orinoco (Venezuela)) through the Imeri, Tapirapecó, Curupira and Urucuzeiro mountain ranges (Brazilian state of Amazonas), and the Parima, Auari, Urutanim and Pacaraima ranges (State of Roraima), in the Guiana Shield.|$|E
5000|$|Product of {{a series}} of {{geographical}} expeditions to Patagonia, the Strait of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego made by the Argentine explorer Francisco Pascasio Moreno and Chilean expert Diego Barros Arana between 1873 and 1879, Argentina in 1881 signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits</b> with Chile. In 1896, problems with the demarcation, the decision had to undergo an arbitration award in Britain. At that time, Moreno was appointed expert on behalf of the Argentine government. In a gesture of brotherhood, 15 February 1899 was found in the Strait of Magellan, Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and Chilean President Federico Errazuriz Echaurren, in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Embrace of the Straits". Finally, the British award was ratified by the General Treaty of Arbitration of 1902 signed in Santiago by Acting Foreign Minister Jose A. Terry, who was criticized on the home front because of the concessions that the country did to Chile and because subjected to perpetual conflict resolution between the two countries to the British crown.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits</b> between Brazil and Bolivia {{was signed}} in 1867, without {{properly}} knowing the geographical location of rivers in the Amazon Basin; {{so much so that}} one of his articles established the boundary line out of the Madeira River, a parallel west to the headwaters of the Javari River - setting even if those sources were north of the parallel (what actually happened), the line should follow [...] "from the same latitude" [...] to that source. In 1898, it was found that according to the 1867 Treaty, the Acre region originally belonged to Peru, but that region had a sizeable population of Brazilian origin. This caused many clashes, since the population did not want to submit to the Bolivian government, which by the way even tried to lease the land to the Anglo-Americans. Several riots emerged, and the situation of noncompliance lasted until 1903, when Brazil militarily occupied the territory until it finally decided the issues. Then Acre was pacified, and a fine was paid to the Anglo-American tenants, who declared the withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|The Kriegsmarine grew rapidly during German naval {{rearmament}} in the 1930s (the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles had <b>limited</b> {{the size}} <b>of</b> the German navy previously, and prohibited building of submarines). Kriegsmarine ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War, {{under the guise}} of enforcing non-intervention, but in reality supporting the Franco side of the war.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles <b>limited</b> the Army to 100,000 men, only 4,000 {{of which}} could be officers. As the {{commander}} in chief of the German Army, Seeckt wanted to ensure that the best officers were retained. The Reichswehr was designed as a cadre force that could be expanded if need be. Officers and NCOs were trained to be able to command at least at the next higher unit level. Almost all of the leaders of the Wehrmacht in World War II were men that Seeckt retained in 1919-20.|$|R
50|$|The {{companies}} origins can {{be traced}} back {{at least as far as}} 1918. With the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles <b>limiting</b> arms production in Germany, the defence based industries in Kiel sought other markets. Kiel Deutsche Werke AG (DWK) was founded; producing diesel locomotives as well as shipbuilding and firearms manufacture. During the second world war Deutsche work produced U-boats, as well as locomotives for the Wehrmacht. The end of the second world war brought not only destruction of many of the facilities in Kiel, but also the end of the company.|$|R
