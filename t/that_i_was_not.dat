5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader David Cameron congratulated Davidson on her win, {{saying that}} he looks 'forward to working with her to {{strengthen}} the Union and build a better future for Scotland'. Outgoing Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie also offered congratulations, pledging 'not be a back seat driver' and was 'confident that she is more than equal to taking on Alex Salmond'. Murdo Fraser conceded defeat, saying he was 'disappointed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> able to persuade more of our members that my {{vision for the future}} is the correct one', but pledged to support Davidson as leader.|$|E

25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
500|$|I have {{to inform}} you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{satisfied}} with the first proof of the Lincoln cent. [...] I found that you had not dropped the Lincoln portrait down so that the head would come nearer {{the center of the}} coin... Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded {{that it would be better}} to put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust". [...] This change has made a marked improvement in the appearance of the coin.|$|E
500|$|Vargas Llosa {{also built}} {{an image of}} the regime with the troubled {{historical}} events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> going to invent anything that couldn't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things {{in order to make the}} story more persuasiveand I have not exaggerated." ...|$|E

500|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} imprisoned {{for the years}} that he prostituted her, and trafficked her across Canada to Edmonton, Vancouver, and Kelowna. Falle later said of herself and the other women in {{prostitution}} she knew, [...] "I couldn't admit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> there by choice. We couldn't live in our own skin if we admitted that. We needed {{to believe that it}} was our choice." [...] Falle's pimp told her he would marry her if she made enough money for him through prostitution. When she had made the amount of money her pimp required, she was 17 years old. The two got married that year.|$|E
500|$|Gillard {{was brought}} up in the Baptist tradition, but is non-religious. In a 2010 interview, when asked if she {{believed}} in God, she stated: [...] "No, I don't... I'm not a religious person... I'm a great respecter of religious beliefs but they're not my beliefs." [...] Comparing Australia to the United States in a 2013 interview with The Washington Post, she stated: [...] "I think it would be inconceivable for me if I were an American to have turned up at the highest echelon of American politics being an atheist, single and childless." [...] In her 2014 autobiography, My Story, Gillard stated, [...] "Kevin had to be the leader in our alliance because I understood <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> what Labor needed at that point: a woman, not married, an atheist." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

500|$|Fuller {{began her}} formal {{education}} at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she {{was sent to the}} School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, [...] "I have felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> born to the common womanly lot." [...] Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of The Young Lady's Friend (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E
500|$|In 1947, the Stalinist {{political}} climate {{led to the}} adoption and imposition by the ruling Polish United Workers' Party of the tenets of Socialist realism, and the authorities' condemnation of modern music which was deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from Stalin personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole Eastern bloc, and was reinforced by the 1948 Zhdanov decree. By 1948, the ZKP {{was taken over by}} musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutosławski resigned from the committee. He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism. His First Symphony was proscribed as [...] "formalist", and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to defect to the United Kingdom. Against this background, he was happy to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned Lutosławski—much to the composer's chagrin—the Prime Minister's Prize for a set of children's songs. He commented: [...] "t was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me .... I realised <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity {{in the eyes of the}} outside world." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand some of what was happening to me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined interracial relationships, self-loathing in matters of sexuality and race, alcoholism, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details {{of what it was like}} to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, a {{teenager}} {{who went to}} the protests in front of the Queen Victoria Street Church of Scientology in London was issued a court summons after being asked to take down a sign that read [...] "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". Posting anonymously on a forum, the teenager stated [...] "Within five minutes of arriving ... I was told {{by a member of the}} police <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> allowed to use 'that word'". He said that the police told him he had 15 minutes to take down the sign. The teenager did not, citing a 1984 high Court ruling by Mr Justice Latey in which he described the Church of Scientology as a [...] "cult" [...] that was [...] "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". The sign was then confiscated. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human rights group, said that, [...] "They will be banning words like 'war' and 'tax' from placards and demonstrations next. This is just barmy". On May 23, 2008, the legal action against the boy was dropped. A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said: [...] "In consultation with the City of London Police, we were asked whether the sign was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness (as opposed to criticism), neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression." [...] Anonymous also held a protest in Budapest, Hungary, in the same time and location as a program of the local Scientology church.|$|E
2500|$|Campese later confessed that, [...] "The chief talking-point was {{the fact}} that I was awarded a try which I never touched down properly. It was not a score.

He {{was a big}} hitter, too, and {{it was difficult to}} bowl a ball from which he could not score. He made me glad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a bowler. Gilbert Jessop certainly drew the crowds, too, even more than Bradman, I should say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{inflammatory}} {{nature of}} portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him, but concluded {{that he would}} hold his own press conference after Dwyer's.

2500|$|Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo's {{incredible}} courage under torture {{that included}} having his nails and teeth pulled out, became legendary. Another was General Simone Simoni , {{a war hero}} aged 64, who had endured torture with a blowtorch.
