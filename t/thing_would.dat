5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be {{tantamount to a}} magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|Like the Storm II, the Mark III was {{initially}} {{available only to}} the military with versions set to be delivered to the Israel Police in 2009. A civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified {{to allow it to}} compete with foreign imports of the same class. AIL states that if such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> happen, a petrol engine version could be offered. Regarding Export markets, the Storm 3 has already seen use in several countries, especially in its armored version.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E

25|$|In the post-fight interview, Rampage {{expressed}} that the fairest <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be to offer Machida an immediate rematch, {{as he felt}} he had lost the fight. Five of 7 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. However, since UFC President Dana White personally felt that Rampage won the fight, he denied the possibility of an immediate rematch. This generated some controversy, as White had previously awarded an immediate rematch to Rua in spite of a unanimous judgment decision awarded to Machida in that fight.|$|E

Despite intervening publications in peer-reviewed journals of articles written by an international team reporting IGE from 178m2Hf, around 2003 IDA took testimony, again from relevant scientists on matters of the credibility of reported results. Professor Carl Collins, the lead U.S. member of the team publishing the successes, did not testify.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the human}} soul, his {{epistemological}} theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, {{the soul is}} definitely not corporeal—if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> come to be within it. Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process. The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.|$|E
25|$|The polite <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be to say 'No comment'. But {{the truth}} is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|The Sex Pistols {{were defined}} by ambitions that went {{well beyond the}} musical—indeed, McLaren was at times openly contemptuous of the band's music and punk rock generally. [...] "Christ, if people bought the records for the music, this <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> have died a death long ago," [...] he said in 1977. The {{degree to which the}} Pistols' anti-establishment stance {{resulted}} from the members' spontaneous attitudes as opposed to being cultivated by McLaren and his associates is a matter of debate—as is the very nature of that stance itself. Deprecating the music, McLaren elevated the concept, for which he later took full credit.|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict, Harper defended Israel's [...] "right to defend itself" [...] and {{described}} its military campaign in Lebanon as a [...] "measured" [...] response, arguing that Hezbollah's release of kidnapped Israel Defense Force (IDF) soldiers would be the key to ending the conflict. Speaking of the situation in both Lebanon and Gaza on July 18, Harper said he wanted [...] "not just a ceasefire, but a resolution" [...] but such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> not happen until Hezbollah and Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist. Harper blamed Hezbollah for all the civilian deaths. He asserted that Hezbollah's objective is to destroy Israel through violence.|$|E
500|$|... "Bounce" [...] {{was written}} by Iggy Azalea, Speedy Jay, Talay Riley, Oladayo Olatunji, Natalie Sims, and its {{producers}} Reeva & Black for Azalea's debut album, The New Classic. With the song, Azalea wanted to showcase a fun side to herself and her artistry, and to offset the seriousness of her previous single, [...] "Work". [...] "Bounce" [...] was written as [...] "something light and fun for the summer" [...] and a [...] "festival anthem" [...] about celebration. Azalea also wanted [...] "to see how the pop-rap <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> go". She recorded the track in early 2013, {{when she was on}} tour with Nas in London. Olatunji recorded background vocals for the track with Azalea at Grove Studios in London. The song was mixed by Anthony Kilhoffer at The Mix Spot in Los Angeles, with assistance from Kyle Ross.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, drinks' {{industry}} {{body the}} Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about {{a scene in}} Holby City episode [...] "Trial and Retribution", which depicted the characters Maddy and Sam Strachan each taking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show {{the negative consequences of}} this action, the series was presenting a [...] "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". The Daily Telegraph noted that the complaint came shortly after Home Secretary Jacqui Smith expressed concern about televisual glorification of drunkenness, having told the Labour Party conference such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be branded unacceptable as part of a [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] approach to anti-social behaviour. In response to the Portman Group's accusation that [...] "We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes", the BBC released a statement explaining that: [...] "Holby City takes the issue of the negative effects of alcohol abuse very seriously. On occasions when our continuing drama series deal with alcohol within a storyline we always seek to handle the issue sensitively".|$|E

500|$|Gordimer's {{response}} to the novel's unbanning was, [...] "I was indifferent to {{the opinions of the}} original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts who made this discovery, since both are part of the censorship system." [...] She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the [...] "serious attention" [...] the book had received abroad. A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including Iris Murdoch, Heinrich Böll, Paul Theroux, John Fowles, Frank Kermode, The Association of American Publishers and International PEN. Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with [...] "special treatment", and said that the same <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> not have happened had she been black. But she did describe the action as [...] "something of a precedent for other writers" [...] because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the authorities had banned. She said that similar [...] "transgressions" [...] in the future would be difficult for the censors to clamp down on.|$|E
500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning {{the pockets of his}} jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kulikovsky {{was sent to the}} front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, [...] "...finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such a small <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> be lost in all the greater things". The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of Kiev, where she was stationed at a hospital. In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law Grand Duke Alexander, two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended. Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys. After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in Kharkov, Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.|$|E

500|$|Robinson chose The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1965 {{because they}} {{offered him a}} full scholarship. Robinson {{intended}} to study towards a medical degree but decided to major in American Studies. During his college days, Robinson began to seriously consider the ordained ministry and said it almost immediately felt right. During high school and then college, Robinson had been exploring philosophical and theological questions and has said, [...] "The Episcopal Church got a hold on me." [...] He graduated from Sewanee cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies in 1969 and attended seminary that fall. Robinson studied for a Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal General Theological Seminary in New York City. While doing an intern year as a chaplain at the University of Vermont, he began dating his future wife, Isabella [...] "Boo" [...] Martin. Robinson says that about [...] "a month into their relationship, [...] explained his background and his fears about his sexuality." [...] They continued dating and, as Robinson puts it, [...] "about {{a month before the}} marriage, [...] became frightened that ... this <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> raise its ugly head some day, and cause her and me great pain." [...] Robinson and Martin discussed it and decided {{to go ahead with the}} marriage in 1972.|$|E
500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film, saying, [...] "It sounds kooky on paper {{but on the}} screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful, fun music together." [...] Honeycutt felt {{that the success of}} the film's blend of aliens and western themes was due to [...] "the {{determination}} by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight. Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, and the whole <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs you shoot at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best." [...] Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were [...] "lovingly" [...] handled but called felt the science aspects a [...] "gimmick" [...] and [...] "much more standard fare" [...] in comparison. He added that [...] "Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself {{in front of a camera}} for the first time in decades".|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
