5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

40|$|Oxaliplatin (OHP) is an anticancer {{agent that}} acts by {{formation}} of Platinum-DNA (Pt-DNA) adducts resulting in DNA-strand breaks {{and is used}} for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The pyrimidine analog <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT) forms together with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) the anticancer drug formulation TAS- 102, in which TPI enhances the bioavailability of TFT in vivo. In this in vitro study the combined cytotoxic effects of OHP with TFT were investigated in human colorectal cancer cells as a model for TAS- 102 combinations. In a panel of five colon cancer cell lines (WiDr, H 630, Colo 320, SNU-C 4 and SW 1116) we evaluated the OHP-TFT drug combinations using the multiple drug-effect analysis with CalcuSyn software, in which the combination index (CI) indicates synergism (CI 1. 1). Drug target analysis was used for WiDr, H 630 and SW 1116 to investigate whether there was an increase in Pt-DNA adduct formation, DNA damage induction, cell cycle delay and apoptosis. <b>Trifluorothymidine</b> combined with OHP resulted in synergism for all cell lines (all CI 20 %) compared with OHP alone. Exposure to the drugs induced a clear cell-cycle S-phase arrest, but was dose schedule and cell line dependent. <b>Trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT) and OHP both induced apoptosis, which increased significantly for WiDr and SW 1116 after TFT-OHP exposure (18. 8 and 20. 6 % respectively; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Herein, {{we report}} a novel {{strategy}} to engineer an acid-sensitive anticancer theranostic agent using a vector− drug ensemble. The ensemble was synthesized by directly conjugating the linoleic acid (LA) -modified branched polyethyleneimine with a chemotherapeutic drug <b>trifluorothymidine.</b> Linoleic acid residues were grafted onto 25 kDa polyethyleneimine (PEI) by treating PEI with linoleic acid chloroanhydride. 5 -Trifluoromethyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (<b>trifluorothymidine,</b> TFT) was introduced into LA-PEI conjugate by phosphorylating the conjugate with amidophosphate of <b>trifluorothymidine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate (pTFT), {{which had been}} activated by its conversion into the N,N-dimethylaminopyridine derivative. The extent of mononucleotide analog incorporation in the polymer was regulated by the ratio of pTFT to the polymer during the synthesis. Samples containing 20 − 70 TFT residues per PEI molecule were obtained. The cytotoxicity of PEI-LA-pTFT conjugates decreased with increasing nucleotide content, as examined using the MTT method. Due {{to the presence of}} fluorine atoms, TFT-based conjugates could be detected directly in the animals by 19 F magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, the presence of the amidophosphate group in PEI-LA-pTFT conjugates allowed their detection by in vivo 31 P NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, the 31 P NMR signal of a phosphoramide (δ ∼ 12 ppm) was observed in the mouse muscle tissue treated with PEI-LA-pTFT conjugate along with the signals from endogenous phosphorus-containing compounds. At the same time, the use of PEI-LA-pTFT conjugate for chemotherapeutic drug delivery is limited due to the low release of pTFT from the carrier. To enhance the release of the drug from the conjugate in the endosomes, PEI-LA polymer was coupled with urocanic acid (UA), which bears imidazole ring and thus can form an acid-labile P−N bond with pTFT. The PEI-LA-UA-pTFT conjugate containing 30 residues of UA and 40 residues of pTFT was tested against the murine Krebs-II ascites carcinoma, grown as an ascetic tumor. The intraperitoneal injection of the conjugates resulted in prolongation of the animals’ life and to the complete disappearance of the tumor after three injections...|$|E

Our data indicate that ISIS 1082 {{had no effect on}} HeLa cell viability as measured by cellular proliferation and clonogenic assays at concentrations as high as 100 microM. Additionally, DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis were only inhibited by 25 % in cells treated with 100 microM ISIS 1082.

40|$|Mammalian {{cell culture}} {{systems can be}} used to detect {{mutations}} induced by chemical substances. One of the most commonly used mammalian cell mutagenesis system; the L 5178 Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma-TK assay detects the mutations at the thymidine kinase locus caused by base pair changes, frameshift and small deletions. Mutant cells, deficient in TK due to the forward mutation in the TK locus (from TK + to TK-), are resistant to the cytotoxic effect of pyrimidine analogues such as <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT). The mutagenicity of the test agents is indicated by {{the increase in the number}} of mutants after treatment. 2. Background Thymidine monophosphate (TMP) occupies a unique position in DNA replication. Of the four principle desoxyribonucleotide monophosphates, TMP alone does not undergo significant conversion to other nucleotides. This conservation makes the TMP pool size quite small and constant under normal growth condition, which serves as a regulator for DNA synthesis. If the TME is replaced by other lethal TMP analogues, the cell will be killed. The phosphorylation of these analogues is mediated by the &quot;salvage &quot; enzyme thymidine kinase (TK), which normally phosphorylates thymidine to TMP in most mammalian cells. TK-deficient cells lack this enzyme activity and therefore are resistant to the cytotoxic effect of the lethal analogues. In the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, the TK-conpetent L 5178 Y (TK+/+ or TK+/-) cells are treated with the test agents. After certain period of expression, the cells are shifted to a selective medium containing the lethal analogues such as <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT).

In contrast, estro gen-independent human breast cancer cells do not activate this pro grammed cell death pathway following estrogen ablation. This could be due either to the absence of the cellular machinery required for pro grammed cell death or simply to the inability of estrogen ablation to activate this machinery. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the MDA-MB- 468 estrogen-independent human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line was used as a model system to study the mechanism of cell death following cytotoxic drug treatment.

The results obtained from inhibition by cytosinearabinoside, aphidicolin, <b>trifluorothymidine,</b> and fluorodeoxyuridine agreed well with the common knowledge about these drugs. Short-term (but not long-term) treatments with methotrexate were compensated by injections of thymidine-nucleotides. The effect of hydroxyurea was in part, but not fully, reversed by injection of all four deoxytriphosphates; this implies a second mechanism besides inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT) -induced DNA damage, we developed an enzymatic method for the synthesis of single-strand oligonucleotides containing TFTmonophosphate residues. Sixteen-mer oligonucleotides and 14 -mer 5 ′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were annealed to the template of 25 -mer, so as to empty one nucleotide site. TFT-triphosphate was incorporated into the site by DNA polymerase and then ligated to 5 ′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides by DNA ligase. The synthesized 31 -mer oligonucleotides containing TFT residues were isolated from the 25 -mer complementary template by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Using these single-strand oligonucleotides containing TFT residues, the cleavage of TFT residues from DNA, using mismatch uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) of E. coli origin, was {{compared with that of}} 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).

In Lovo cells TFT plus TPI only increased thymidine phosphorylase-protein expression 1. 7 -fold; 5 'DFUR and TFT treatment increased thymidine phosphorylase mRNA levels 5 - and 1. 4 -fold, respectively. In WiDR cells, 5 'DFUR plus TPI significantly decreased thymidine phosphorylase-protein. TFT and TFT plus TPI increased thymidine phosphorylase-protein 2 - and 3 -fold, respectively. TPI and 5 'DFUR decreased thymidine phosphorylase-mRNA levels significantly. In HT 29 cells, 5 'DFUR and 5 'DFUR plus TPI decreased both thymidine phosphorylase-protein and thymidine phosphorylase-mRNA. In all cell lines 5 'DFUR and TFT did not affect thymidine phosphorylase activity, but treatment with TPI (alone or in combination) eliminated thymidine phosphorylase activity. This demonstrated that regulation is drug and cell line dependent...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} in vivo {{system was}} studied {{for use in}} evaluating relatively small quantities of antiviral compounds. Swiss mice were injected intracerebrally with 10 LD 50 of type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV) or vaccinia virus. Test compounds were injected intracerebrally into mice at a standard time interval after virus inoculation. Significant increases {{in the number of}} survivors in drug-treated, infected animals as compared to saline-treated virus controls was the criterion for evaluation of antiviral activity. 9 -β-d-Arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara-A) was used to determine an optimal time of therapy for this system. Significant survival increases occurred when the drug was injected 3, 6, 12, and 48 hr after HSV inoculation, with maximal effect occurring after the 6 -hr treatment interval. Determination of brain virus titer of 6 -hr Ara-A- and saline-treated mice at various intervals indicated that treatment with the drug delayed development of detectable levels of HSV by 1 day. 1 -β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT), and 5 -iodo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (IDU) were also evaluated {{with the use of the}} 6 -hr treatment time against HSV and vaccinia virus. Ara-A and TFT increased the number of survivors among mice infected with either virus, whereas Ara-C increased the survivors among HSV-infected, but not vaccinia virus-infected, mice. IDU was inactive against both viruses...|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium spp. cause acute {{gastrointestinal}} {{disease that}} can be fatal for immunocompromised individuals. These protozoan parasites are resistant to conventional antiparasitic chemotherapies and the currently available drugs to treat these infections are largely ineffective. Genomic studies suggest that, unlike other protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidium is incapable of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Curiously, these parasites possess redundant pathways to produce dTMP, one involving thymidine kinase (TK) and the second via thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase. Here we report the expression and characterization of TK from C. parvum. Unlike other TKs, CpTK is a stable trimer in the presence and absence of substrates and the activator dCTP. Whereas the values of kcat = 0. 28 s− 1 and Km,ATP = 140 μm {{are similar to those}} of human TK 1, the value of Km(thymidine) = 48 μm is 100 -fold greater, reflecting the abundance of thymidine in the gastrointestinal tract. Surprisingly, the antiparasitic nucleosides AraT, AraC, and IDC are not substrates for CpTK, indicating that Cryptosporidium possesses another deoxynucleoside kinase. Trifluoromethyl thymidine and 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine are good substrates for CpTK, and both compounds inhibit parasite growth in an in vitro model of C. parvum infection. <b>Trifluorothymidine</b> is also effective in a mouse model of acute disease. These observations suggest that CpTK-activated pro-drugs may be an effective strategy for treating cryptosporidiosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{assaying}} human interchromosomal recombination in vitro was developed, using a cell line containing two different mutant thymidine kinase genes (TK) on chromosomes 17. Heteroalleles were {{generated in the}} TK+/+ parent B-lymphoblast cell line WIL- 2 by repeated exposure to the alkylating nitrogen mustard ICR- 191, which preferentially causes + 1 or - 1 frameshifts. Resulting TK-/- mutants were selected in medium containing the toxic thymidine analog <b>trifluorothymidine.</b> Mutations were characterized by exon-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. In two lines, heterozygous frameshifts were located in exons 4 and 7 of the TK gene separated by approximately 8 kilobases. These lines undergo spontaneous reversion to TK+ at a frequency of less than 10 (- 7), and revertants can be selected in cytidine/hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium. The nature and location of these heteroallelic mutations make large deletions, rearrangements, nondisjunction, and reduplication unlikely mechanisms for reversion to TK+. The mode of reversion to TK+ was specifically assessed by DNA sequencing, use of single-strand conformation polymorphisms, and analysis of various restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) linked to the TK gene on chromosome 17. Our data suggest that a proportion of revertants has undergone recombination and gene conversion at the TK locus, with concomitant loss of frameshifts and allele loss at linked RFLPs. Models are presented for the origin of two recombinants...|$|E
40|$|Famciclovir (FCV) is efficacious in the {{treatment}} of acute herpes zoster and recurrent genital infections but has not been used to treat ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. We evaluated the efficacy of orally administered FCV in treating HSV- 1 epithelial keratitis and determined its effects on the establishment of latency and subsequent reactivation. Rabbits were inoculated with HSV- 1 strain 17 syn+ and treated twice daily with increasing concentrations of FCV (60 to 500 mg/kg of body weight). This resulted in a significant, dose-dependent improvement in keratitis scores, as well as prolonged survival. Regardless of the dose of drug used, all groups exhibited the high rates of spontaneous and induced reactivation characteristic of 17 syn+. The efficacy of 250 mg of FCV per kg was also compared to topical treatment with 1 % <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT). Although TFT treatment was more effective at reducing eye disease, FCV-treated rabbits had a better survival rate. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of rabbit trigeminal ganglia (TG) demonstrated that FCV significantly reduced the HSV- 1 copy number compared to that after treatment with TFT or the placebo but not in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, oral FCV treatment significantly reduces the severity of corneal lesions, reduces the number of HSV- 1 genomes in the TG, improves survival, and therefore may be beneficial in reducing the morbidity of HSV keratitis in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{activity of}} <b>trifluorothymidine</b> (TFT) singly and {{in combination with}} other antiviral agents against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was evaluated by using an infectious center plaque reduction assay. The 50 % inhibitory dose of TFT against six different patient HCMV strains was 0. 57 (+/- 0. 24, standard deviation) microM and ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 97 microM. The 50 % inhibitory dose for the laboratory-adapted HCMV strain, AD- 169, was 2. 1 microM. When TFT (0. 17 microM) was combined with human fibroblast interferon (25 U/ml), the combination was additive against all four HCMV isolates evaluated. Synergism was observed when TFT (0. 17 microM) was combined with phosphonoformic acid (25 microM) for all strains studied or with acyclovir (20 microM) for three of the four clinical HCMV strains tested. Each of the three antiviral agents, when combined with TFT, exhibited additive effects against strain AD- 169. TFT at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 7, and 3. 5 microM had an increasing inhibitory effect on uninfected human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL) cell growth over 72 h, with 16 % growth inhibition at 3. 5 microM after 3 days. There was no increased toxicity to growing HEL cells when the paired antiviral agent combinations were evaluated. These findings suggest that TFT may be useful singly or {{in combination with other}} antiviral agents in treating HCMV infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of thymidine kinase in fungi, which normally lack this enzyme, will greatly aid {{the study of}} DNA metabolism and provide useful drug-sensitive phenotypes. The herpes simplex virus type- 1 thymidine kinase gene (tk) was expressed in Neurospora crassa. tk was expressed as a fusion to N. crassa arg- 2 regulatory sequences and as a hygromycin phosphotransferase-thymidine kinase fusion gene {{under the control of}} cytomegalovirus and SV 40 sequences. Only strains containing tk showed thymidine kinase enzyme activity. In strains containing the arg- 2 - tk gene, both the level of enzyme activity and the level of mRNA were reduced by growth in arginine medium, consistent with control through arg- 2 regulatory sequences. Expression of thymidine kinase in N. crassa facilitated radioactive labeling of replicating DNA following addition of [3 H]thymidine or [14 C]thymidine to the growth medium. Thymidine labeling of DNA enabled demonstration that hydroxyurea can be used to block replication and synchronize the N. crassa mitotic cycle. Strains expressing thymidine kinase were also more sensitive than strains lacking thymidine kinase to anticancer and antiviral nucleoside drugs that are activated by thymidine kinase, including 5 -fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridine, 1 -(2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -iodouridine and <b>trifluorothymidine.</b> Finally, {{expression of}} thymidine kinase in N. crassa enabled incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA at levels sufficient to separate newly replicated DNA from old DNA using equilibrium centrifugation...|$|E
