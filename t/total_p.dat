The P. rebeli caterpillars have two strategies for living and growing underground: to exist as fast-developing larvae (FDL) or slow-developing larvae (SDL). After the ant brood adopts the FDL, which comprise approximately 25% of the <b>total</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae, the FDL complete growth the following spring and eclose (emerge as an adult from the pupa) in early summer to complete their life cycle.

While both larva types ultimately form similar-sized pupae, their polymorphic growth rates could indicate alternative fitness strategies and different ways to exploit the M. schencki food resources.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the scarlet tiger moth Callimorpha (Panaxia) dominula (family Arctiidae), which is a diurnal moth occurs in {{continental}} Europe, western Asia and southern England, three forms occur in England: the typical homozygote; the rare homozygote (bimacula) and the heterozygote (medionigra). It was studied there by E. B. Ford, and later by P. M. Sheppard and their co-workers over many years. Data is available from 1939 to the present day, got by the usual field method of capture-mark-release-recapture and by genetic analysis from breeding in captivity. The records cover gene frequency and population size for much of the twentieth century. In this instance the genetics appears to be simple: two alleles at a single locus, producing the three phenotypes. Total captures over 26 years 1939-1964 came to 15,784 homozygous dominula (i.e. typica), 1,221 heterozygous medionigra and 28 homozygous bimacula. Now, assuming equal viability of the genotypes 1,209 heterozygotes would be expected, so the field results do not suggest any heterozygous advantage. It was Sheppard who found that the polymorphism is maintained by selective mating: each genotype preferentially mates with other morphs. This is sufficient to maintain the system despite the fact that in this case the heterozygote has slightly lower viability. Another example is the genetic polyrmorphism of larval developmental rates seen in the Phengaris rebeli, in which there exist slow-developing larvae (SDL) (75% of the <b>total</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larval population) and fast-developing larvae (FDL) (25% of the <b>total</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli larvae population). The slow-developing larvae do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of the}} second summer and remain a second winter within the ant colonies. On the other hand, the FDL complete their growth the following spring after they are taken into the ant nest.|$|E

He joined the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) during the Indian independence movement. In 1927, {{he was involved in}} the protests against the Simon Commission. Like many other members of the CSP in South India he then joined the Communist Party of India, {{and was one of the}} founding members of the party in Tamil Nadu. He became the Secretary of CSP in Tamil Nadu and was a member of the All India Congress Committee. In 1936 he began organising trade unions. Ramamurti was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952 from the Madurai North Constituency. At the time he was in jail. In <b>total</b> <b>P.</b> Ramamurti spent eight years in jail and five years underground. Ramamurti was affectionately referred to as PR within the party and the larger Indian Left. He was the first Leader of the Opposition of the Madras State in 1952 in a House of 375. This was before the First States Re-organisation in 1956, which led to the creation of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This election returned a fractured mandate, without any party gaining a simple majority. The Communist-led coalition formed the largest block and staked claim to form the government. But C. Rajagopalachari, India's first Governor General after Independence who was also from Madras, came out of retirement and convinced the then Madras Governor Sri Prakasa to invite him to form a Congress government in the state. The decision was highly criticized and was viewed as the Indian National Congress' machinations to defeat a popular government led by Communists. Rajagopalachari was not an elected member of the assembly as he had not participated in the polls.6789 Rajagopalachari requested Prakasa to nominate him to the assembly thereby foregoing the usual process of election by the members of the assembly. Ramamurti opposed this by way of a petition in the Madras High Court seeking to annul Rajagoplachari's nomination. Ramamurti's daughter R. Vaigai writes about this during the end of a year-long celebration of his birth centenary in 2008 in The Hindu. [...] In 1953, at the 3rd CPI party congress, he was elected to the Central Committee and the politburo of the party. In 1964, Ramamurti and Bhupesh Gupta, another towering communist who remained in the CPI till he died, led 32 leaders out of the parent party to form the CPI(M). In 1967 he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Madurai constituency. In 1970 he became the first general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.|$|E

40|$|Abandonment of {{agricultural}} soils {{is a common}} practice in Western Europe to increase the area of nature and to counteract agricultural overproduction. However, {{it has been suggested}} that abrupt changes in management of land, such as abandonment of heavily fertilized agricultural fields, could trigger leaching of phosphorus into deeper soil layers and groundwater. In a previous study we observed that total phosphorus (P) in the upper 10 cm of ex-arable soils in the Netherlands was negatively related to the time of abandonment. In a subsequent study in the region reported here, we measured <b>total</b> <b>P</b> concentrations at different soil depths in four ex-agricultural fields that differed in time since abandonment to examine if the decrease in <b>total</b> <b>P</b> with increasing time of abandonment could be due to leaching of P into deeper soil layers. At each site <b>total</b> <b>P</b> concentration decreased with increasing depth, and for each soil profile depth, <b>total</b> <b>P</b> also decreased with increasing years since abandonment. We calculated, based on estimated P fertilizer gifts over the last decades and the regression coefficient of the relation between <b>total</b> <b>P</b> in a core of 95 cm and time of abandonment, the amount of net <b>total</b> <b>P</b> that should have accumulated in the oldest ex-arable field to reach the P level of the most recently abandoned field. The continuation of accumulation of P for a longer period of time in recently abandoned fields appeared to be the most reasonable explanation for the decrease of P with years of abandonment. Therefore, abandonment {{of agricultural}} land does not seem to trigger a ‘chemical time bomb’ to explode as no large amounts of P seem to leach into deeper soil layers. ...|$|E

In agricultural ecosystems, phosphorus constraints are much more critical because phosphorus {{is removed from the}} system in the harvested crops with only limited quantities being returned in crop residues and animal manures (Brady and Weil 2002). Phosphorus does not occur as abundantly in soils as N and K. <b>Total</b> <b>P</b> in surface soils varies between 0.005 and 0.15  % and unfortunately the quantity of <b>total</b> <b>P</b> in soils has little or no relationship to the availability of P to plants (Havlin et al. 1999). Because part of the <b>total</b> <b>P</b> can be in fixed form in acidic soils and is not readily available to plant uptake.

Among the different fractions of P, HC 1 extractable P fraction dominates the soils P pool for soils of Dinsho district, whereas soils’ P pool of Cheha district was dominated by res-P. The sum of the labile P fractions (NH 4 Cl-Pi, NaHCO 3 -Pi, and NaHCO 3 -Po) constitutes less than 4 % of <b>total</b> <b>P</b> in soils from both districts reflecting very low reserves of crystalline Fe and Al-P.

A major source of nutrient enrichment in urban areas is stormwater runoff, which is transferred from impervious surfaces in urban catchments and discharged at outlets on the residential/bushland interface. We measured the spatial extent of soil total phosphorus (P) enhancement below stormwater outlets on Hawkesbury Sandstone-derived soils in northern Sydney and examined whether <b>total</b> <b>P</b> concentration has increased with time since urban development and extended laterally beyond the stormwater flow path. The average area of soil P enhancement below outlets was 0. 24 ± 0. 05 ha and was widest 30 - 50 m downslope from the outlet, where it extended an average 40 m across slope. Catchment area was not significantly related to average soil <b>total</b> <b>P</b> concentration. There was a significant decline in <b>total</b> <b>P</b> across slope from the centre of the flow path and a significant positive relationship between soil <b>total</b> <b>P</b> and proportion of exotic plant cover, with soil P accounting for 77. 5 % of variation. We found evidence for a buildup in soil <b>total</b> <b>P</b> concentration over time within the run-on zone below outlets, with the rate of enhancement being ~ 68 mg/kg per decade over a 40 -year period. Evidence for lateral transfer of soil P out of the run-on area was more equivocal. There was a significant decline in soil <b>total</b> <b>P</b> across slope from the boundary of the run-on zone, with higher concentrations at distances 0. 5 m and 1 m from the boundary compared with > 1. 5 m.

There was no significant relationship between soil P in the non run-on zone and age of development, which would be expected if P was being transferred by biological activity beyond the run-on zone over time. It is clear that the primary areas of concern for management must be the run-on areas below outlets. 6 page(s...|$|E

More significantly, however, in the present study, Bray 1 extractable P increased from a low 80  mg P kg− 1 where no RP was added to 207  mg P kg− 1 where RP was added at a rate of 4 % P (Table  5). This contributed to the increase in the extractable P and, thus, implies significant increases in the effectiveness of vermicompost in providing available P.|$|E
