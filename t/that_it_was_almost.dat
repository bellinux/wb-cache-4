5|$|The {{building}} {{was in such}} a state of disrepair by the 1980s <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used as a real estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its current name, La Stazione. The {{building was}} expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.|$|E
5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being {{for the most part}} learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E
25|$|During further stormy weather, {{the ship}} was pushed onto the beach so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> {{parallel}} to the beach, and both bow and stern were stuck on the sand. The whole ship was then completely trapped between the beach and a rocky reef. In the first week the salvage crew loaded the ship with ballast water, which sunk it lower, so that its hull was firmly on the seabed.|$|E

Although they are unmarked, each 3×3 subsquare does indeed comprise the numbers 1–9 and the additional constraint on the broken diagonals leads to only one solution.|$|E

25|$|The Nazi {{fascination with}} Wagner was largely {{inspired}} by Hitler, sometimes {{to the dismay}} of other high-ranking Nazi officials, including Joseph Goebbels. In 1933, for instance, Hitler ordered that each Nuremberg Rally open with a performance of the overture from Rienzi. He also issued one thousand free tickets for an annual Bayreuth performance of Meistersinger to Nazi functionaries. When Hitler entered the theater, however, he discovered <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> empty. The following year, those functionaries were ordered to attend, but they could be seen dozing off during the performance, so that in 1935, Hitler conceded and released the tickets to the public.|$|E
25|$|Cistern 16/17 (located at {{the centre}} of the far {{northern}} end of the Temple Mount). Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large vaulted chamber, which Warren described as looking like the inside of the cathedral at Cordoba (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> certainly built for some other purpose, and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.|$|E
25|$|In {{the forties}} {{of the twentieth}} century, Steven Corbet was deputy-keeper of the insect {{collection}} of the Natural History Museum. He {{was at that time}} also the foremost authority on the Linnean butterflies, and had access tot the collection of the Linnean Society. During research, Corbet found the specimen labelled Ajax in Linnaeus's own handwriting. From the way it was pinned, Corbet concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> certainly a specimen collected by Pehr Osbeck in Canton in 1751, so not of North-American origin. Corbet at once identified the type as a specimen of the Oriental species named Papilio xuthus by Linnaeus in 1767, a name by which it has ever since been known.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Dukes {{were loaded}} into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January, {{they left the}} prison. They drove towards the river by the Field of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and {{was shot in the}} back as he fled. The truck {{eventually}} began running again, and they drove to the Peter and Paul Fortress. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> 20 degrees below zero. By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the Grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at {{the centre of the}} rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|Plumer {{arranged}} for the medium and heavy artillery reinforcements reaching Flanders {{to be added to}} the creeping bombardment, which had been impossible with the amount of artillery available to the Fifth Army. The revised tactics were to ensure that more infantry attacked on narrower fronts, to a shallower depth than on of 31 July, like the Fifth Army attacks in August. The shorter and quicker advances were intended to be consolidated on tactically advantageous ground, especially reverse slopes, with the infantry still in contact with the artillery and aircraft, ready to repulse counter-attacks. The faster tempo of the operations was intended to add to German difficulties in replacing tired divisions through the railway bottlenecks behind the German front. The pause in British attacks misled the Germans and Thaer at , wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> boring. Kuhl doubted that the offensive had ended but by 13 September changed his mind; two divisions, thirteen heavy batteries and twelve field batteries of artillery, three fighter squadrons and four other air force units were transferred from the 4th Army.|$|E

Batch equilibrium tests showed that at pH 8. 5 the maxima of mercury absorption rate (80 %) obtained. By increasing initial concentration, absorption rate increases (increases up to 7. 5 mg L - 1 after <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> constant). Time contact has a direct effect on biosorption up to 60 min after <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> constant or desorption occurred.

25|$|In July 2014, Microsoft {{announced}} plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft has laid off 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with US financial crisis. In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle-Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brings the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts. In October 2014, Microsoft revealed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> done with the elimination of 18,000 employees which was its largest ever layoff sweep. In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts {{in the next several}} months. In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in (Nokia) mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.|$|E
