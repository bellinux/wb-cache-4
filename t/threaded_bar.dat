40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to link the slab and girders together in slab-on-girder structures. Assessment of the integrity of shear connectors {{is an important issue}} in the maintenance and health monitoring of such structures. In this study, a 1 : 3 scaled bridge model was constructed with removable anchors linking the slab and girders as shear connectors. Each anchor consisted of a <b>threaded</b> <b>bar</b> penetrating through the soffit of a girder and anchored in the slab by an embedded nut cap with welded steel bar. Different damage scenarios were simulated by removing some of these connectors. A signal-based damage detection method in which the damage feature is characterized by the wavelet packet energy changes was applied to the damage identification of the shear connectors. Using measurements of hammer impact responses, the locations of the loosening of the shear connectors were effectively detected. This paper demonstrates that the wavelet packet-based energy index is a sensitive local damage indicator. The results also show that comparison of the relative vibration between the slab and the girders is a more effective technique for evaluating the shear connector damage than comparison of the vibration of the slab before and after shear connector damage. This finding is particularly interesting because data from the intact (undamaged) bridge is not required. The suitability and efficiency of the approach is expected to be applied in situ to assess the integrity of shear connectors in existing structures.

40|$|Corrosion place a {{high cost}} on {{the society and}} {{selecting}} the wrong materials in certain environments may have catastrophic consequences. When selecting materials {{there is also the}} different manufacturing methods to consider and there might be a difference in corrosion resistance depending on the way the material is manufactured. Also even high grade stainless steels like super duplex may suffer from corrosion in a specific environment. The scope of the thesis compares the manufacturing methods solution annealing and cold straining on a super duplex stainless steel, and the potential effect on stress corrosion cracking and pitting resistance. Earlier research indicates that there might be some uncertainties regarding this, and the amount of research in this field was lacking compared to studies on austenitic stainless steels. The objective of this thesis was to develop a test setup using modified versions of the ASTM G 36 and G 44 standards testing on as received super duplex stainless steel bolts (UNS S 32760) of both solution annealed and cold strained quality. Tensile testing was performed to determine the elongation at yield, and hence being able to determine the percentage of yield for the experiments. The results of the testing were surprising, as the Young’s modulus was around 50 % less than what was expected, due to testing with a <b>threaded</b> <b>bar</b> instead of a smooth. All of the experiments were performed with the bolts stressed to 100 % of offset yield. For the alternate immersion testing, a test jig was designed and used during the whole experiment which was executed over a time period of 936 hours. This setup used magnesium chloride instead of sodium chloride which was specified in the standard to examine if this would accelerate stress corrosion cracking or pitting corrosion. The results from this experiment showed that the solution annealed bolts seemed to exhibit a higher pitting resistance than the cold strained bolts. Also this experiment indicates that this type of experiment may take too long time to be effective. Four 316 L bolts were also tested in the alternate immersion testing and exhibited obvious pitting as expected. The results however must be considered with caution as only two solution annealed bolts and two cold strained bolts were tested. It is therefore not possible to conclude on this matter. In regards to stress corrosion cracking, no cracks were discovered at 10 X magnification, but further metallographic testing should be performed to verify that no cracks are present. The heated immersion testing in magnesium chloride was performed at 90 ℃ instead of 155 ℃ as specified in the standard. An initial test performed for 316 hours produced fracture in the two solution annealed and two cold strained bolts that were tested. No pitting was observed at 10 X magnification. A second heated immersion test was performed for 156 hours and this test may indicate that there is higher stress corrosion cracking resistance in the solution annealed bolts compared to the cold strained. There was however only two bolts of each type tested in this experiment as well, so {{it is not possible to}} conclude without further experiments. No pitting was observed with 10 X magnification on any of the bolts. The final results indicate that solution annealed bolts exhibits a higher resistance in regards to both stress corrosion cracking and pitting corrosion. Further testing needs to be performed however to verify this as there a low number of specimens tested...|$|E

Abstract : Bamboo is {{a building}} material that can renew it self in a unbeatable rate, and has important mechanic properties for been used on structural projects. Is ass well, a very versatile element {{on the building}} industry and a very economic material. However, its natural rounded shape restricts constructing formal possibilities and favor the appearance of pathologies associated with the building technique. The {{aim of the research}} was to develop a structural construction joint with Guadua Bamboo taking into account parameters of low cost, pre-assembly possibilities, easy implementation and formal versatility. The joint pieces were designed and developed and a formal analysis was made to determine the architectural possibilities of the element. Afterwards, there were conducted a series of tensile and compressive tests on eight sample bodies constructed whit Bamboo Guadua and the designed joint, on the Universidad Nacional de Colombia?s structures laboratory. The strength tests were applied on two joints with different sizes arranged on to configurations: linear and crossed. The joint reached tensile strength values over 13 kN for the linear configuration, and over 32 kN for the crossed one. Those values represent 157, 3 % and 187, 5 % of the Colombian NSR- 10 regulation admissible strength values for Bamboo Guadua. It was observed that those values could be easily improved, because the structure failure was on the <b>threaded</b> <b>bar</b> grabbed to the press. For the compressive tests the results came above 16 kN for the linear configuration and above 19 kN for the crossed one. This represent 240, 9 % and 121, 2 % of the Colombian NSR- 10 regulation admissible strength values for Bamboo Guadua. Finally a structural portion of the design prototype was build with the developed joint, by which was concluded that the element has good structural performance, especially with tensile axial forces, making it suitable for building projects...|$|E
