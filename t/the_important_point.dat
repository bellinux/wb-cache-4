25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality.

25|$|Garuda Vyuha is worshiped in Tantra for Abhichara and {{to protect}} against Abhichara. However, the {{interesting}} thing is that Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during creation primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). <b>The</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> is that Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of Monier's {{idea was}} that it {{combined}} steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or crushing strength, but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in tensile or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. But it is difficult and expensive to work up into customized forms. Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of tensile strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the tensile stresses occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. <b>The</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer {{must be prepared to}} establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

But the zero-point field re-emerges as the homogeneous solution for the field equation. A charged particle in the vacuum will therefore always see a zero-point field of infinite density. This is the origin of one of the infinities of quantum electrodynamics, and it cannot be eliminated by the trivial expedient dropping of the term [...] in the field Hamiltonian.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{time series}} often exhibit high degrees of {{fluctuation}} which are considered as noise in time series analysis. To remove noise, several lower bounding the Euclidean distance based dimensionality reduction methods are applied. But, however, these methods {{do not meet}} the constraint of financial time series analysis that wants to retain <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>points</b> and remove others. Therefore, although a number of methods can retain <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> financial time series reduction, but, however, they loss the nature of financial time series which consist of several uptrends, downtrends and sideway trends in different resolutions and in the zigzag directions.

2500|$|Stuart now {{sought to}} take a useful role in the {{campaign}} and perhaps, according to some historians, to redeem his reputation and to secure the glory of another ride around the Union Army. On June 22, Lee gave Stuart discretionary orders for his movement to Pennsylvania with <b>the</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> being: [...] "If you find that he [...] is moving northward, and that two brigades can guard the Blue Ridge {{and take care of}} your rear, you can move with the other three into Maryland, and take position on General Ewell's right." [...] Lee wrote to Stuart again on June 23 in an apparent effort to clarify his orders as follows: [...] "You will, however, be able to judge whether you can pass around their Army without hindrance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell's troops." [...] Lee's orders did not give Stuart a specific route to follow. Confederate Colonel Edward Porter Alexander, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, stated [...] "Stuart made to Lee a very unwise proposition, which Lee more unwisely entertained." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. <b>The</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
