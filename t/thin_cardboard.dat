500|$|The album's art {{design was}} {{credited}} to Capitol's in-house designer, Roy Kohara. Harrison supplied sketches {{for each item}} of the artwork, which adopted a humorous, [...] "wacky" [...] theme throughout the packaging. The vivid-orange front cover featured a die-cut design around the words [...] "EXTRA TEXTURE", through which an inner-sleeve, blue-tinted picture of Harrison was visible. Some vinyl editions presented the words as simple blue text on an orange background, however, doing away with the expensive cut-out detail. In keeping with the album title, the <b>thin</b> <b>cardboard</b> used for the LP cover was similar in texture to the [...] "animal skin used on a football", according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer. The front cover included an Om symbol, positioned below the angled title text and also coloured blue. On {{the back of the}} inner sleeve, there was a second Henry Grossman tour photo of Harrison, clearly enjoying himself on stage.|$|E

2500|$|The company {{took the}} first steps towards {{developing}} the View-Master stereoscope after a chance meeting, at the Oregon Caves in 1938, between Graves and William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte & Sons and an avid photographer, living in Portland. The View-Master used disk-shaped [...] "reels" [...] which are <b>thin</b> <b>cardboard</b> disks containing seven stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small color photographs on film, and its individual eyepieces immersed the viewer into the scene more fully than previous stereoscopes. [...] Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had developed the idea of mounting tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock, for viewing in a stereo slide viewer designed for the reels. [...] Gruber partnered with the owners of Sawyer's to develop the invention.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoroscopy's {{origins and}} radiography's origins can both {{be traced back}} to 8 November 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen, or in English script Roentgen, noticed a barium {{platinocyanide}} screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call X-rays (algebraic x variable signifying [...] "unknown"). [...] Within months of this discovery, the first crude fluoroscopes were created. [...] These experimental fluoroscopes were simply <b>thin</b> <b>cardboard</b> screens that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent metal salt, attached to a funnel-shaped cardboard eyeshade which excluded room light with a viewing eyepiece which the user held up to his eye. The fluoroscopic image obtained in this way was quite faint. Even when finally improved and commercially introduced for diagnostic imaging, the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens of the earliest commercial scopes necessitated that a radiologist sit for a period in the darkened room where the imaging procedure was to be performed, to first accustom his eyes to increase their sensitivity to perceive the faint image. [...] The placement of the radiologist behind the screen also resulted in significant dosing of the radiologist.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Caswall's {{experiments}} with the kite went on successfully. Each day {{he tried the}} lifting of greater weight, and it seemed {{almost as if the}} machine had a sentience of its own, which was increasing with the obstacles placed before it. All this time the kite hung in the sky at an enormous height. The wind was steadily from the north, so the trend of the kite was to the south. All day long, runners of increasing magnitude were sent up. These were only of paper or <b>thin</b> <b>cardboard,</b> or leather, or other flexible materials. The great height at which the kite hung made a great concave curve in the string, so that as the runners went up they made a flapping sound. If one laid a finger on the string, the sound answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent murmur. Edgar Caswall, who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all belonging to it, found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the pigeons flying through the dry reeds.|$|E

50|$|The album {{topped the}} U.S. Billboard Pop Albums in both February and May 1971 and ranked {{number one in}} the year-end chart ahead of Carole King's massive hit Tapestry. It also served as a {{launching}} pad for numerous stage productions on Broadway and in the West End. The original 1970 boxed-set issue of this 2-record set was packaged in the U.S. with a special <b>thin</b> brown <b>cardboard</b> outer box which contained the 2 vinyl records and a 28-page libretto. The album was listed as the top-selling LP on the U.S. Billboard Pop chart of 1971. It is also the sixth most successful album of all time in Norway, peaking at No. 3 and staying on the charts for 87 weeks.|$|R

50|$|The {{plastic resin}} is {{commonly}} used as an oxygen barrier in food packaging. It is better than other plastics at keeping air out and flavors in, is highly transparent, weather resistant, oil and solvent resistant, flexible, moldable, recyclable, and printable. Its drawback {{is that it is}} difficult to make and therefore more expensive than other food packaging. Instead of making an entire package out of EVOH, manufacturers keep costs down by coextruding or laminating it as a <b>thin</b> layer between <b>cardboard,</b> foil, or other plastics.|$|R
5000|$|A doughnut, or donut, is a <b>thin</b> {{metal or}} <b>cardboard</b> panel, similar {{in shape and}} {{appearance}} to a colour frame, but with a small diameter hole intended to reduce off-axis rays of light being projected from a fixture. [...] This increases sharpness of the light by reducing the effect of imperfect lenses. Doughnuts are designed {{to fit into the}} colour frame holder directly outside the fixture, immediately in front of lens assembly. Because they are typically thin, doughnuts can often be placed in the same slot as a gel frame. Doughnuts are typically used in fixtures in order to sharpen the beam when a template is in place.|$|R
50|$|Spree is a candy {{manufactured}} by The Willy Wonka Candy Company, a brand owned by Nestlé. Spree {{was created by}} the Sunline Candy Company, later renamed Sunmark Corporation, of St. Louis, MO in the mid-1960s. Spree was an idea of an employee named John Scout. In the 1970s the brand was bought by Nestle' who markets the candy under the Willy Wonka brand. Spree is classified as a compressed dextrose candy, covered in a colored fruit-flavored shell. Depending on the market it is available in rolls or <b>thin</b> food type <b>cardboard</b> boxes. A variation called Chewy Spree is also available in two distinct types: Chewy Spree Original and Chewy Spree Mixed Berry. Chewy Spree boasts a similar size and shape as classic Spree, but with a chewy center. Chewy Spree is available in pouches, rather than rolls.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, the British Army were equipped with simple rectangular fuel containers: a 2 imp gal container made of pressed steel and a 4 imp gal container made from tin plate. While the 2-gallon containers were relatively strong, they were expensive to produce. The 4-gallon containers, which were mainly manufactured in Egypt, were cheap and plentiful but they were not very robust. Consequently, they were colloquially known as flimsies. The first 4-gallon containers were protected by a wooden case, packed in pairs of tins to a case, and were reasonably robust. As the war progressed, this case was replaced by <b>thin</b> plywood or <b>cardboard</b> and gave little protection. These flimsies were considered as only usable for one trip and were usually discarded at their destination, rather than returned for re-use. One informal military use was as the 'Benghazi burner' cooking stove.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} records {{were made of}} a simple sheet of fairly <b>thin</b> printed <b>cardboard</b> with a very thin plastic coating and their audio quality was substandard. Some were more sturdy and well-made and they equaled or {{actually}} surpassed the audio quality of ordinary records, which were still made of a gritty shellac compound that introduced a lot of background noise. In 1933, RCA Victor in the U.S. issued a few typical cardboard-based picture records but was unhappy with their quality and soon began making an improved type. A rigid blank shellac core disc was sandwiched between two illustrated sheets and each side was then topped with a substantial layer of high-quality clear plastic into which the recording was pressed. Like nearly all records being made for the general public, they were recorded at 78 rpm, but one issue was recorded at 33⅓ rpm, a speed already in use for special purposes which Victor was then unsuccessfully attempting to introduce into home use. It was the first 33⅓ rpm picture disc {{and the only one}} made until many years later. These were deluxe picture discs, priced much higher than ordinary records, and they sold in very small numbers. In the early 1930s the entire record industry was being devastated by a worldwide economic depression and the proliferation of the new medium of radio, which made a wide variety of music available free of charge. Picture discs of all kinds were among the casualties.|$|R
50|$|On the {{right-hand}} edge is a long, curved steel blade, {{often referred to}} as a knife, attached to the base at one corner. Larger versions have a strong compression coil spring as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper. The other end of the knife unit is a handle. The stationary right edge of the base is also steel, with an exposed, finely-ground edge. When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two knives moving against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting <b>thin</b> sheet metal, <b>cardboard,</b> and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which makes it almost impossible to break.|$|R

50|$|To {{create the}} Autochrome color filter mosaic, a thin glass plate was first {{coated with a}} {{transparent}} adhesive layer. The dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye. They were then spread onto the adhesive, creating a layer with approximately 4,000,000 grains per square inch but only one grain thick. The exact means by which significant gaps and overlapping grains were avoided still remains unclear. It {{was found that the}} application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion, because the grains would be flattened slightly, making them more transparent, and pressed into more intimate contact with each other, reducing wasted space between them. As it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once, a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time. Lampblack was used to block up the slight spaces that remained. The plate was then coated with shellac to protect the moisture-vulnerable grains and dyes from the water-based gelatin emulsion, which was coated onto the plate after the shellac had dried. The resulting finished plate was cut up into smaller plates of the desired size, which were packaged in boxes of four. Each plate was accompanied by a <b>thin</b> piece of <b>cardboard</b> colored black on the side facing the emulsion. This was to be retained when loading and exposing the plate and served both to protect the delicate emulsion and to inhibit halation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} {{reusable}} practice device that could help golfers analyze their shots. A Magic Pad, consisting of a translucent, plastic top layer and a statically charged <b>thin</b> layer of <b>cardboard,</b> was modified and placed on the clubface. When the clubface strikes the ball, the top plastic layer attaches itself to the bottom layer creating a noticeable impression. By peeling the top layer, the device could be reset and used again several times. A series of tests was conducted to prove the viability of this device. The device was effective in analyzing several aspects of a golf shot. The marks made on the device from impact with the ball were clear and dark. This device is most effective in determining the placement of the ball on the clubface, but it is also successful in identifying inaccurate shots. Slices occur when the club head does not hit the ball squarely, and this is translated unto the device. A few characteristic marks signal a slice. The most obvious is a mark with amorphous shape, favoring one side of the ball, instead of a circular indentation. Shear streaks, straight diagonal lines at the angle of impact, are also apparent and allow the golfer to adjust their swing to compensate. (cont.) The third aspect of the shot that the device could have measured was the power. A bigger indentation did not necessarily produce the greatest yardage, however. The most impressive indentations were produced by a combination of accuracy and power. In this way, the golfer can clearly identify a quality shot. This fact, coupled with the inexpensive materials, makes the device a viable product. by Severiano R. Canales. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|To {{prevent the}} {{infestation}} of foodstuffs by pests of stored products, or “pantry pests”, a thorough inspection must be conducted {{of the food}} item intended for purchase at the supermarket or the place of purchase. The expiration date of grains and flour must also be noted, as products that sit undisturbed on the shelf {{for an extended period}} of time are more likely to become infested. This does not, however, exclude even the freshest of products from being contaminated. Packaging should be inspected for tiny holes that indicate there might be an infestation. If there is evidence of an insect infestation, the product should not be purchased. The store should be notified immediately, as further infestation must be prevented. Most stores have a plan of action for insect infestations. Bringing an infested product into a pantry or a home leads to a greater degree of infestation.In the home, putting cereal or grain-type items in protective containers will also help to prevent an infestation or the spread of insects from one product to another. Insects can chew through <b>thin</b> plastic, foil, <b>cardboard</b> and other packaging used for product for resale; transferring purchased products into heavy glass containers that can be tightly sealed or heavy plastic containers can improve sanitation and prevent infestation. Using the oldest products first and buying grains and cereals in smaller quantities which can be used quickly, depending on the size or intake of the family, decreases the chances of infestation. Fruit flies, however, present an entirely different approach to prevention. The primary method to controlling and eliminating fruit flies is to eradicate sources of attraction. Ripened produce should be either eaten, discarded, or refrigerated. Any damaged or cracked fruit or vegetable needs to be trimmed, and the damaged piece discarded in case larvae or eggs are present in the area in question. Careful attention must be paid to potential breeding sites that, when forgotten, could cause a massive infestation- all recycling and compost bins must be cleaned, and areas must be checked for forgotten, rotting fruit. Because of their small size, fruit flies are capable of breeding on the inside of the lid of a container. Therefore, when personally canning fruits or vegetables, beer, cider, or wine, the container must be well-sealed. Adults moths can lay eggs under the lid of a jar, allowing the larvae to crawl into the food source when hatched. Homeowners should also outfit their doors and windows with tight mesh screens to prevent the adult fruit flies from flying in from outdoors. Preventive methods and sanitation are the keys to avoiding an infestation or contamination of foodstuffs.|$|R
