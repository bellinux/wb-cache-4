The diesel looked the same, inside and out, as did the regular Minitre. At the time of introduction (April 1984), this engine {{was not only the}} smallest passenger car diesel in the world, but also had the highest specific output of any naturally aspirated diesel engine in series production - it thus made for a surprisingly spirited performer. Introduced {{as part of an effort}} to bring Innocenti production above the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability,</b> around 20,000 cars annually, the Minidiesel sold very well. The diesel took thirty percent of the overall production with nearly no negative effect on sales of the petrol versions, a considerably bigger share than the expected twenty percent. It was helped by a lack of real competitors - by 1988 it still only had to compete with the 1.3 litre Fiat Uno and Panda diesels, as well as the Volkswagen Polo diesel, all of which were in a higher tax bracket and had higher fuel consumption.|$|E

40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{and processing}} of microalgal biomass is resource- and energy-intensive, negatively affecting the sustainability and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> producing bulk commodities, limiting this platform to {{the manufacture of}} relatively small quantities of high-value compounds. A biorefinery approach where all fractions of the biomass are valorized might improve the case for producing lower-value products. However, these systems are still likely to operate very close to <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> and energy balance, with wide-ranging environmental and societal impacts. It thus remains critically important to reduce the use of costly and impactful inputs and energy-intensive processes involved in these scenarios. Integration with industrial infrastructure can provide a number of residual streams that can be readily used during microalgal cultivation and downstream processing. This review critically considers {{some of the main}} inputs required for microalgal biorefineries - such as nutrients, water, carbon dioxide, and heat - and appraises the benefits and possibilities for industrial integration on a more quantitative basis. Recent literature and demonstration studies will also be considered to best illustrate these benefits to both producers and industrial operators. Additionally, this review will highlight some inconsistencies in the data used in assessments of microalgal production scenarios, allowing more accurate evaluation of potential future biorefineries...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} banking relationships on firm performance for a sample of Indian manufacturing firms. The two variables used to portray banking relationships are: the extent of bank borrowing {{and the number of}} banking relationships maintained by a firm. Analysis suggests that while the extent of bank borrowing has a negative impact on firm performance, the multiple banking relationships maintained by a firm positively enhances firm performance. In addition, firm performance {{plays an important role in}} influencing bank borrowing and the number banking relationships a firm maintains. While banking relationships are positively impacted by firm performance, results suggest nonlinearity between bank financing and firm performance, suggesting the possibility of a potential debt overhang concern. This implies that firms with low growth opportunities tend to borrow more from banks due to lack of other opportunities to finance their investments. However, firms beyond a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> tend to employ lesser debt to finance their investments in order to prevent the wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors. ...|$|E
