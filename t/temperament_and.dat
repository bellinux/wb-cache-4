5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. There is some evidence that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, Limousin breeders {{have worked}} {{extensively}} on improving disposition issues in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.

5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E

5|$|Several years later, Radha's two {{surviving}} children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), {{are young}} men. Birju, embittered since childhood by {{the demands of}} Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens {{the gate of the}} canal and its reddish water flows into the fields.|$|E
5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Albany, New York, Hand majored in {{philosophy}} at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City, he was appointed {{at the age of}} 37 as a Federal District Judge in Manhattan in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded <b>temperament,</b> <b>and</b> his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly's social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party's candidate for Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the Senior Circuit Judge (later retitled Chief Judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country's history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand's promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.|$|E

5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> a {{reputation}} for intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E
