5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of {{the manor}} in the mid-14thcentury and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Seringapatam, the Christian captives {{were made to}} forcibly embrace Islam, were tortured, or sentenced to death.. The young men who refused to embrace Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. They were seated on asses, paraded through the city, and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Historian Praxy Fernandes, author of Storm over Seringapatam: The Incredible Story of Hyder Ali & Tippu Sultan, states that contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, 40,000 Christians were not kept manacled in the dungeons of Seringapatam.|$|E

40|$|Catchwords refer <b>to</b> those <b>popular</b> {{words or}} phrases {{in a time}} period. In this paper, we propose a novel {{approach}} for automatic extraction of Chinese catchwords. By analyzing features of catchwords, we define three aspects <b>to</b> describe <b>Popular</b> Degree of catchwords. Then we use curve fitting in Time Series Analysis <b>to</b> build <b>Popular</b> Degree Curves of the extracted terms. Finally we give a formula that can calculate Popular Degree values of catchwords and get a ranking list of catchword candidates. Experiments show that the method is effective. ...|$|R

5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at {{the feet}} of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> tradition, Kanhopatra merged with the image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E

5|$|Considered {{by many to}} be {{the most}} {{important}} Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.|$|E

5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, Ima did {{not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, {{great white}} sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, it is {{not only}} males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
40|$|An {{embedded}} wavelet coder {{is proposed}} for arbitrarily shaped image objects. Contrary <b>to</b> the <b>popular</b> approach of considering transparent regions surrounding image objects as permanently insignificant, the proposed coder imposes no assumptions on the significance state of unknown transparent regions. Instead, the proposed shape-adaptive tarp coder employs a simple algorithm called tarp filtering {{to produce a}} probability estimate of coefficient significance which propagates unchanged across transparent regions. Experimental {{results show that the}} shape-adaptive tarp coder offers coding performance superior <b>to</b> a <b>popular</b> zerotreebased technique and equivalent <b>to</b> a <b>popular</b> method based on context conditioning. 1...|$|R

5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, {{only a few}} {{sharks are}} {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin {{conceived}} the initial {{idea for the}} episode, Steve O'Donnell was the lead writer, and Steven Dean Moore directed.

5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>popular</b> belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
