5|$|The natural cycle, {{in which}} the hits come in order from least total bases to most (single, double, triple, and home run), has been {{accomplished}} 14 times in MLB history. Bill Collins {{was the first to}} collect the hits in order on October 6, 1910. The natural cycle happened most commonly in the 1960s, occurring <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-year span (Jim Hickman in 1963, Ken Boyer in 1964, and Billy Williams in 1966).

5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years. The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year. The champion also receives a gold medal, which they are allowed to keep permanently. Until 1870 the champion received the Challenge Belt, however when Tom Morris Jr. (more commonly known as Young Tom Morris) won the Open Championship <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row he won the belt outright, necessitating the need for a new trophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{return to}} Allsvenskan {{was the start}} of the {{successful}} early 2000s, under the management of Tom Prahl, when the club finished in the top three <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row. In 2004, it won Allsvenskan, the club's fifteenth Swedish Championship. In 2005, the club reached the last qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League but were defeated by FC Thun. Successful sponsor work and player sales also made Malmö FF the richest club in Sweden, a position they still hold as of 2013. The club moved from Malmö Stadion to Swedbank Stadion in 2009, a stadium built entirely for football and located next to the old one.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E

5|$|Australia batted {{much more}} productively {{in the second}} innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings {{at the home of}} cricket. Yardley {{surrounded}} the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads. The Australian captain decided to negate the danger of being caught glancing at short fine leg by padding the ball away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of Bradman's bat <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion.

Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.|$|E
5|$|Battle Mountain {{changed hands}} so often during August {{that there is}} no {{agreement}} on the exact number of times. The intelligence sergeant of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry estimated the peak changed hands 19 times. From August 18 {{to the end of the}} month, North Korean troops attacked the mountain every night. The peak often changed hands two or <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 24-hour period. The usual pattern was for the North Koreans to take it at night and the US 24th Infantry to recapture it the next day. This type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment. During the period of August 15–31, seven forward observers and eight other members of the Observer and Liaison Section of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion were casualties, and they lost eight radios, 11 telephones, and two vehicles in the process.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E
5|$|FC Bayern {{was founded}} in 1900 by 11 {{football}} players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success {{in the middle of}} the 1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, it won the European Cup <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern has reached ten European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals, most recently winning their fifth title in 2013 as part of a continental treble. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally and the only German club to have won both international titles. Since the formation of the Bundesliga, Bayern has been the dominant club in German football with 27 titles and has won 9 of the last 13 titles. They have traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg, as well as with Borussia Dortmund since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|In May, del Potro had {{to retire}} again, {{this time in}} a first-round match against Andy Murray at the Rome Masters.

Del Potro's serve was subsequently broken <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, and he suffered a back injury, which caused his retirement. In his second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open, he was eliminated in the second round by Simone Bolelli in four sets. In June, he reached the semifinals of the Ordina Open, losing to eventual winner and top seed David Ferrer in straight sets.

5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas {{that would otherwise be}} too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity set a MLB record {{during the}} 1904 season {{recording}} his tenth win in 21 team games on May 21, the fewest team games to for a pitcher {{to reach the}} mark. In 1904, McGinnity had a 35–8 record, leading the NL in games (51) innings pitched (408), shutouts (9), saves (5), and his career-best 1.61 ERA. With the Giants competing for the pennant, McGinnity again won both games in a doubleheader <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matter of weeks. Aided by McGinnity, the Giants again won the NL pennant. However, they did not compete in the 1904 World Series as Brush and McGraw refused to face the AL champion Boston Pilgrims, following their altercations with Johnson. After the 1904 season, McGinnity attempted to hold out from the Giants when Brush refused to allow McGinnity to play winter baseball with a team in the Southern United States.|$|E
