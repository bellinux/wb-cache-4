50|$|An early {{version of}} a car alarm {{for use as a}} <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent</b> was invented by an unknown {{prisoner}} from Denver in 1913. This version was manually armed, and triggered when someone tried to crank the engine. A later alarm inspired by an {{early version of}} a remote starter was published in 1916. This version had the car owner carry a receiver, which would buzz if the car ignition system was tampered with.|$|R
40|$|Stall {{deterrent}} concepts {{for general}} aviation aircraft {{have been investigated}} using simulation studies and flight test experiments. It {{was found that the}} simulator was suitable for the development of <b>deterrent</b> <b>system</b> concepts, but the simulator was unacceptable for pilot evaluation of system effectiveness under typical stall/spin accident conditions. A Cessna 319 was outfitted with sensors, servoactuators, and analog control logic necessary to investigate a wide range of stall <b>deterrent</b> <b>systems.</b> It was found that an acoustic stall sensor and an error control law were sufficient for stall deterrence. The pitch intervention control system prevented aircraft stall for all aircraft configurations and pilot inputs. The variable up elevator stop concept was found to be effective for slow decelerations to aircraft stall. The stall <b>deterrent</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated by four professional pilots and three low time pilots...|$|R

50|$|The {{commercials}} {{focus on}} the Trunk Monkey, a fictional dealer-installed option on cars. The optional feature consists of a live chimpanzee inside the trunk and a special button in the passenger compartment. The button is pressed in situations {{not found in the}} user's manual such as handling irate drivers in traffic, dealing with unruly children throwing eggs at the car, negotiating with highway patrol officers after being pulled over, helping deliver a child when a nearby hospital is not accessible, or dispatching a gang in the parking lot. The Trunk Monkey is also portrayed as an effective <b>theft</b> <b>deterrent,</b> as seen in one commercial where the chimpanzee knocks out a would-be car thief and throws him off a bridge. The chimpanzee also administers first aid to the driver after an accident. In addition, its security abilities are effective during a driver's daughter's first date or an alien invasion.|$|R
50|$|Within the Great Pyramid of Giza (completed around 2560 BC), an Egyptian <b>deterrent</b> <b>system</b> {{was built}} to guard the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu.

40|$|From April 22 through July 20, 1993, we {{conducted}} a follow-up study to confirm that high-frequency broadband sound (122 - 128 kHz) at a source level (in decibels dB in reference to 1 mu Pa) of 190 dB reduced the impingement of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) at the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF), located on Lake Ontario near Oswego, New York. During the first full-scale test in 1991, the sound field covered only {{the front of the}} JAF intake. In this second full-scale test, the sound field included the top, sides, and rear of the JAF intake to prevent fish from approaching the intake from those directions when the JAF reactor was shutdown and the hot water discharge, located 57 m offshore from the intake, disappeared. Our study also provided the opportunity {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>deterrent</b> <b>system</b> during a mass die-off of alewives that occurred in Lake Ontario during late spring and early summer in 1993. We used a before-after-control-impact pairs (BACIP) design to test and quantify the effectiveness of the <b>deterrent</b> <b>system.</b> The new sound field reduced the impingement of alewives by 81 - 84 % during a year following an unusually cold winter and should reduce impingement by 87 % during most years...|$|R

The city suffers from these worries {{as well as}} high taxes, poor transportation options and few jobs for many workers, all detrimental {{the quality of life}} of Philadelphia citizens. Severe congestion, high costs of car ownership as the mounting price of public have severely impeded personal mobility in the city. One answer to this detrimental problem can be found in Europe, through public-use bicycles (PUBs). In over 60 European cities, PUBs have made an enormous impact on personal mobility, allowing citizens to access the city through bicycles, used as a part of public transportation. Through user accountability and <b>theft</b> <b>deterrents,</b> PUB programs provide citizens with a highly efficient and reliable transportation option. Philadelphia could benefit greatly from such a program. Through a study of successful PUB programs throughout the world, Philadelphia can garner information regarding implementation, funding, operation, and infrastructure. All this information will be put forth in order to deliberate on the best practices of other models and see them replicated in Philadelphia. It is hoped that, in the future, Philadelphia will have a very successful large-scale public-use bicycle program, the first of its kind in North America...|$|R
