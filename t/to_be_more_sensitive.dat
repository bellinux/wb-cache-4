5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, {{making them more}} liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested}} that bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E

40|$|The amylase {{creatinine}} clearance ratio (ACCR) <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> index of acute pancreatitis than the serum amylase level. Serial ACCR estimations were undertaken in 25 patients undergoing an elective cholecystectomy. Using accepted criteria, 28 % {{of these patients}} developed, in the postoperative period, biochemical evidence of pancreatic gland damage, although the serum amylase level remained normal. This raised ACCR was particularly noted in patients who had undergone {{an exploration of the}} common bile duct. The ACCR would appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> index of pancreatic gland disruption secondary to biliary surgery than the serum amylase level...|$|R

25|$|The {{shift of}} {{benzodiazepine}} receptors to an inverse agonist state after chronic treatment leads the brain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to excitatory drugs or stimuli. Excessive glutamate activity {{can result in}} excitotoxicity, which may result in neurodegeneration. The glutamate receptor subtype NMDA {{is well known for}} its role in causing excito-neurotoxicity. The glutamate receptor subtype AMPA is believed {{to play an important role}} in neuronal kindling as well as excitotoxicity during withdrawal from alcohol as well as benzodiazepines. It is highly possible that NMDA receptors are involved in the tolerance to some effects of benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies have observed {{a correlation between}} high levels of dioxins and PCBs in humans and {{a wide variety of}} adverse health effects e.g. chloracne, lowering of IQ, dysfunction of the thyroid gland and reduction of thyroid hormone levels, elevated rates of endometriosis in women, higher levels of diabetes in women, precocious puberty in females and subtle developmental delay in children, as evidenced by altered play activity. Males appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to poisoning by high levels of dioxins & dioxin-like PCBs {{and are more likely to}} develop severe symptoms e.g. young men poisoned by TCDD (the most toxic dioxin) are less likely to father boys. See Geusau et al. (2001) who describe the clinical manifestations of two extremely severe (and probably criminal) dioxin poisoning cases.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{there are}} three types of rods used today graphite, fiberglass, and bamboo rods. Bamboo rods are the {{heaviest}} of the three, but people still use it for its feel. Fiberglass rods are the heaviest of the new chemically-made material rods. They are mostly popular with the new and young anglers, as well as anglers who cannot afford the generally more expensive graphite rods. They are more commonly found among those anglers that fish in rugged areas such as on rocks or piers where potentially knocking the rod on hard objects is a greater possibility. This may potentially cause breakage, making a fiberglass rod more preferable for some anglers due to its higher durability and affordability compared to graphite rods. Today's most popular rod tends to be graphite for its light weight characteristics {{and its ability to}} allow for further and more accurate cast. Graphite rods tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive,</b> allowing the user to feel bites from fish easier.|$|E

2500|$|The rise in {{testosterone}} levels during competition predicted aggression in males {{but not in}} females. Subjects who interacted with hand guns and an experimental game showed rise in testosterone and aggression. Natural selection might have evolved males <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to competitive and status challenge situations and that the interacting roles of testosterone are the essential ingredient for aggressive behaviour in these situations. Testosterone produces aggression by activating subcortical areas in the brain, which may also be inhibited or suppressed by social norms or familial situations while still manifesting in diverse intensities and ways through thoughts, anger, verbal aggression, competition, dominance and to physical violence. [...] Testosterone mediates attraction to cruel and violent cues in men by promoting extended viewing of violent stimuli. Testosterone specific structural brain characteristic can predict aggressive behaviour in individuals.|$|E
2500|$|These early {{headphones}} used moving iron drivers, {{with either}} single-ended or balanced armatures. [...] The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm. [...] The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves. [...] The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor sound quality. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75ohms. Those used with early wireless radio had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> and were made with more turns of finer wire. Impedance of 1000 to 2000ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers. [...] Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{costs of}} youth {{exclusion}} {{can be measured}} in terms of its multi-dimensional nature. This includes how the intersection of race, gender, class and social location affect youth's ability to access employment, education or other social networks that are imperative to their transition to adulthood. Exclusion can preserve negative prejudices or stereotypes within a culture. Urban youth in America face greater prejudice in environments in which ethnic minorities face minimal intergroup contact in peer settings like school. Gendered differences continue to be problematic in this situation as well. Girls prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to recognizing racial exclusion among their peers since they also face gender discrimination in school settings. Cultural norms associated with gender play a pivotal role in the perpetuation of the division between excluders and the excluded, creating unequal opportunities among youth. Barriers to social organizations and opportunities can result in unwanted consequences including crime and violence. There are many examples in which youth have formed groups that oppose oppressive and exclusionary governments through violent demonstrations, especially among African nations. These violent reactions also lead to concerns about youth politics, youth identity and the future well-being of nations facing this type of conflict with their youth populations. Indian youth experiencing [...] "timepass" [...] also show signs of increased aggression. Specifically this aggression has been directed towards women, since young men feel powerless in their current state of unemployment.|$|E
