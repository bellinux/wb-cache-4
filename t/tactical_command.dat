5|$|In the engagement, U.S. Marines {{from the}} 7th Marine Regiment and U.S. Army {{soldiers}} from the 164th Infantry Regiment under the <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> of William H. Rupertus and Edmund B. Sebree, attacked a concentration of Japanese Army troops, most of whom belonged to the 230th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Toshinari Shōji. Shōji's troops had marched to the Koli Point area after the failed Japanese assaults on U.S. defenses during the Battle for Henderson Field in late October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{promoted}} to temporary wing commander on 1August 1943, Rawlinson handed over command of No.79 Squadron on 7November and was appointed wing leader of No.73 Wing, headquartered at Kiriwina. The wing leader was responsible for <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> of the formation in the air. Minimal offensive air activity by the Japanese meant that No.79 Squadron's Spitfires saw relatively little action; the wing's Kittyhawks, with their ground-attack capability, were heavily engaged. On 15December, {{the day of the}} Allied landings at Arawe, No.76 Squadron Kittyhawks patrolled above the beaches while the Spitfires remained at Kiriwina in case of strikes by Japanese raiders, though none came.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the corps}} {{was rushed to}} the Villers-Cotterêts area in {{preparation}} for the Third Battle of the Aisne, the first major Allied counteroffensive of the year. There, it was put under the French Tenth Army and given administrative command of the 1st Division and the 2nd Division which were previously under command of the French XX Corps. However, the command group arrived in the area too late to exercise <b>tactical</b> <b>command,</b> and it was instead attached to the French XX Corps. On 18 July, the attack was launched, with the force spearheading the French Tenth Army's assault on the high ground south of Soissons. During this attack, the Corps also cut rail lines supplying the German Army.|$|E

5|$|In the engagement, seven battalions of U.S. Marine and Army troops {{under the}} overall command of Alexander Vandegrift and <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> of Merritt A. Edson, {{following}} up on the U.S. victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, crossed the Matanikau River and attacked Japanese Army units between the river and Point Cruz, on the northern Guadalcanal coast. The area was defended by the Japanese Army's 4th Infantry Regiment under Nomasu Nakaguma along with various other support troops, under the overall command of Harukichi Hyakutake. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese defenders, U.S. forces halted the offensive and temporarily withdrew because of a perceived threat from Japanese forces elsewhere in the Guadalcanal area.|$|E
5|$|The main Japanese {{force in}} the {{campaign}} {{was provided by the}} XVIII Army under the command of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi and was headquartered at Madang. This force consisted of three divisions– the 20th, the 41st and the 51st– and a number of smaller forces which included naval infantry and garrison units. Around the Finschhafen area in mid-September 1943, the main forces were drawn from the 20th Division's 80th Infantry and 26th Field Artillery Regiments, the 41st Division's 238th Infantry Regiment, the naval 85th Garrison Unit and a company from the 51st Division's 102nd Infantry Regiment. These forces were under the command of Major General Eizo Yamada, commander of the 1st Shipping Group, although <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> was devolved at local level due to the geographical spread of the Japanese units. These units were situated across a broad area between the Mongi River, east of Lae to Arndt Point, Sattelberg, Joangeng, Logaweng, Finschhafen, Sisi and on Tami Island. The largest concentrations were around Sattelberg and Finschhafen, where the main forces came under the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, commander of the 20th Division. The strength and efficiency of the Japanese units had been reduced by disease, and their employment in road construction tasks between Madang and Bogadjim.|$|E

25|$|The American victory bred {{controversy}} {{in the ranks of}} the naval officer corps over the question of which commanding officer deserved credit for the victory.

They also discussed launching a disinformation propaganda campaign on public and private television and having government loyalists fill the highways with their vehicles and then present the images on TV as if people were busy working like any other day. In another plan to end the strike, Gastón Parra, the president of PDVSA, suggested to give bonuses to PDVSA employees who chose not to participate in the strike.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{estimated}} US {{strength in}} the area to be between 5,000 and 10,000 troops; in reality over 14,000 troops had been landed around Cape Torokina on the first day. These were followed by another 3,500 on 6 November. These troops were drawn from Major General Allen H. Turnage's 3rd Marine Division, which had landed as part of Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's Third Fleet Amphibious Forces. Following the initial landing operations, Turnage, assisted by Brigadier General Oscar R. Cauldwell, had been in <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> of the US troops ashore while Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift returned to Guadalcanal with Wilkinson. As Japanese resistance to the landing petered out, Turnage began reorganizing his forces around the perimeter, establishing patrols and unloading supplies, and commencing important base development work.|$|E

Warren reported to his immediate superior, Major General George G. Meade, who remained in direct <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> of the Army of the Potomac, that Dinwiddie Court House was undefended. By 8:45a.m., Meade sent an order to Warren which arrived at 10:20a.m., and told Warren to advance in strength on the Quaker Road across Gravelly Run and contact the II Corps to his right. Warren misunderstood or ignored the order and sent only Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's brigade up the Quaker Road until noon.

25|$|The complex {{plan was}} mismanaged from the start. Johnston chose to issue his orders to Longstreet orally {{in a long}} and {{rambling}} meeting on May 30. The other generals received written orders that were vague and contradictory. He also failed to notify all of the division commanders that Longstreet was in <b>tactical</b> <b>command</b> south of the river. (This missing detail was a serious oversight because both Huger and Smith technically outranked Longstreet.) On Longstreet's part, he either misunderstood his orders or chose to modify them without informing Johnston. Rather than taking his assigned avenue of advance on the Nine Mile Road, his column joined Hill's on the Williamsburg Road, which not only delayed the advance, but limited the attack to a narrow front with {{only a fraction of}} its total force. Exacerbating the problems on both sides was a severe thunderstorm on the night of May 30, which flooded the river, destroyed most of the Union bridges, and turned the roads into morasses of mud.|$|E
