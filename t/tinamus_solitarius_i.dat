5000|$|Several {{theories}} have been advanced {{to explain the}} origin of the blue egg characteristic.

40|$|The walking {{parameters}} of the tinamous (<b>Tinamus</b> <b>solitarius,</b> Crypturellus obsoletus and Rhynchotus rusfescens) and cariamids (Cariama cristata and Chunga burmeisteri) were studied {{with the aim of}} verifying whether the duration of the swing phase is a discriminant parameter for paleognathous and neognathous birds. Tinamous are paleognathous birds as are the ratites, whereas the cariamids are neognathous birds sharing a cursorial adaptation with the large ratites. Osteological measurements of the long bones of the hind limbs, and frame by frame analysis of high speed video records of the birds walking under usual conditions, allowed for comparing duration of the swing phase in two functional categories: birds with long stretched-hind limbs versus those with short flexed-limbs. In addition were compared birds of two distinct phylogenetic groups: Neognathae vs Palaeognathae. Results indicate that there is a correlation between the duration of the swing phase and two studied clades, the paleognathous birds having a longer swing phase duration than neognathous birds belonging to the same functional categories. However, this parameter alone does not allow for discriminating between groups. The functional categories are also correlated to the duration of the swing phase as flexed-limb birds have a shorter swing phase than the stretched-limb ones. These data are congruent with several recent phylogenetic analysis results, placing the Tinamidae as a sister group of ratites within the Palaeognathae taxon...|$|R

Uma dessas espé cies estudadas para fins cientí ficos, a perdiz (Rhynchotus rufescens), apresenta potencialidades para a produ ção {{comercial}} em cativeiro. Com o objetivo de determinar polimorfismos gené ticos nessa espé cie e em outras espé cies de tinam ídeos, foram desenvolvidos 16 pares de primers de microssaté lite para a perdiz a partir de biblioteca gen ômica enriquecida com microssat élites. A fim de se verificar a amplificação cruzada em perdiz e em outros tinam ídeos foram utilizados 10 pares de primers desenvolvidos para avestruzes (Struthio camelus) e outros 10 pares desenvolvidos para o inhamb ú-da-cabe ça-vermelha (Tinamus major). Dos 16 locos desenvolvidos para perdiz, 8 apresentaram sucesso na amplificação nessa esp écie e apenas cinco amplificaram em outros tinamídeos. Foi realizada a genotipagem em 26 amostras de perdizes e obtidas estimativas relacionadas ao percentual de locos polimó rficos (50 %), nú mero m édio de alelos por loco (5, 75), conte údo polim órfico informativo m édio (0, 62) e diversidade gené tica esperada (0, 69).

The São Paulo State University UNESP, Jaboticabal campus has {{for several}} years research with wild animals, contributing for the preservation and production of the species threatened by extinction. One of these species is the red-winged-tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens), that has potential for production in captivity. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine genetic microsatellite polymorphisms in this species and other tinamous species. Sixteen microsatellite primer pairs were developed for the red-winged-tinamou from a genomic library enriched with microsatellites. In order to verify the cross amplification for the tinamous species we used 10 pairs of primers designed for ostriches (Struthio camelus) and 10 pairs developed for Tinamus major. From the 16 loci developed for red-winged-tinamou, 8 amplified in this species and only five amplified in other Tinamous. Genotyping was performed on 26 samples and estimates related to the percentage of polymorphic loci (50 %), average number of alleles per locus (5. 75), polymorphic information content (average 0. 62) and expected genetic diversity (0. 69). In order to test the transferability of the primer pairs developed for T. major, only one had a specific amplification in partridges, with observed rates of crossamplification of 100 and 70 % for macuco (<b>Tinamus</b> <b>solitarius)</b> and the azulona (Tinamus tao), respectively. The amplifications in other tinamous were restricted to five microsatellite loci. With the use of computer programs and statistical analysis, we estimated genetic and phenotypic parameters of morphometric characteristics in red-winged-tinamou, in order to [...] .

40|$|The fat-derived peptide leptin regulates {{cellular}} {{activity in}} areas of the CNS related to feeding, and application of leptin to the fourth ventricle or the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) inhibits food intake and weight gain. The hypothesis that leptin modulates cellular activity in the NTS was tested using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brainstem slices. Leptin caused a rapid membrane hyperpolarization in 58 % of rat NTS neurones, including neurones receiving tractus <b>solitarius</b> input (<b>i.</b> e. viscerosensory) and those involved in regulating output to the stomach, identified after gastric inoculation with a transneuronal retrograde viral label. The hyperpolarization was accompanied by a decrease in input resistance and cellular responsiveness, reversed near the K+ equilibrium potential, and was prevented by intracellular Cs+. Perfusion of tolbutamide (200 μm) or wortmannin (100 – 200 nm) prevented the hyperpolarization, indicating activation of an ATP-sensitive K+ channel via a PI 3 kinase-dependent mechanism. Constant latency tractus solitarius-evoked EPSCs were decreased in amplitude by leptin, and the paired-pulse ratio was increased, suggesting effects on evoked EPSCs involved activation of receptors on vagal afferent terminals. Leptin reduced the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs, whereas IPSCs were largely unaffected. Leptin's effects were observed in neurones from lean, but not obese, Zucker rats. Neurones that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in a subpopulation of putative GABAergic neurones in transgenic mice did not respond to leptin, whereas unlabelled murine neurones responded similarly to rat neurones. Leptin therefore directly and rapidly suppresses activity of excitatory NTS neurones likely to be involved in viscerosensory integration and/or premotor control of the stomach...|$|R
