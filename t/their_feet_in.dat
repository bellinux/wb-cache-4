5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> place.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} rough cut of the film to {{determine}} what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting sequences, in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine minutes that lack action. The playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> appreciation.|$|E

I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E

5|$|Linden's long tenure {{with the}} Canucks (Linden holds second most games played in {{franchise}} history at 1,140), deep attachment {{to the city of}} Vancouver and history of charitable community service and involvement have {{made him one of the}} most beloved and respected players among fans {{in franchise history}}. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting that he was too excited to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> recognition of Linden.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed very comfortable fighting on <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E
50|$|Most limpets feed by grazing on algae which {{grows on}} the rock (or other surfaces) where they live. They scrape up films of algae with a radula, a ribbon-like tongue with rows of teeth. Limpets move by {{rippling}} the muscles of <b>their</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a wave-like motion.|$|R
50|$|The Austrians built {{impressive}} fortifications in the 1830s, using Carnot's ideas, at Verona in Italy. These {{consisted of}} massive ramparts with a Carnot wall at <b>their</b> <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> {{the same period}} the Russians used the walls in fortifying Warsaw. In Germany examples were built at Coblenz and Ulm.|$|R

5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly {{in front of the other}} and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|E
25|$|UFC 6 – The referee {{was given}} the {{authority}} to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled {{in a position where}} {{there was a lack of}} action, the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> their own corner. In UFC 6 they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in UFC 5.|$|E
25|$|Farhad-beg-yailaki {{lies on the}} {{southern}} Silk Road in the Kingdom of Khotan. Sir Mark Aurel Stein explored the remains of Buddhist shrines there which he dated from the fourth to sixth century AD. Stein discovered Buddha statues wearing robes with bright floral designs on which had piles of fabrics offered at <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> worship. Stein {{concluded that there was}} evidence of contact with many cultures in Farhad-beg-yailaki. Murals found there depicted two important Buddhist mythological figures, Hariti and Avalokitesvara, draped in cloth with Sassanian designs on.|$|E

25|$|Modern boxers can {{sometimes}} be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> order to move effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg {{in the direction of}} the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.|$|E
25|$|The medial is {{the part}} of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the {{opposite}} side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp. Most shoes have shoelaces on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with Velcro straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Some bands mark time by {{bringing}} their feet {{all the way}} up to their knee—known as high-mark time. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a greater sense of marching while actually standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching. Traditionally, the drumline would put <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> a V-shape and lift their feet fully off the ground a few inches. This is to avoid hitting the drums.|$|E
50|$|The basic step is for {{the leader}} to touch <b>their</b> left <b>foot</b> behind them, but not to shift their weight, on counts 1 and 2, while the {{follower}} mirrors the motion by touching <b>their</b> right <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> front of them without shifting weight. On counts 3 and 4, both partners bring <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> back to a standing position, but shift their weight onto the foot they have just moved. On counts 5 and 6, the leader touches <b>their</b> right <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> front of themselves while the follower touches <b>their</b> left <b>foot</b> back. On 7 and 8, both feet are {{brought back to the}} standing position where the necessary weight shift occurs to allow the basic step to repeat.|$|R

25|$|Services of {{that era}} were austere and lengthy, {{conducted}} in strict accordance with Calvinist beliefs. On the Sabbath day, liquor consumption, discharge of firearms and beating of drums were forbidden, with steadily escalating penalties starting at one Flemish pound. The church itself was unheated, due to fears of fire. Some congregants brought small stoves to warm <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> winter. They sat in seats {{on either side of}} the sanctuary. A Vorleser (reader) and Vorsanger (music leader) assisted the minister. There were no books for the audience since many were illiterate.

25|$|Because of the {{controversy}} surrounding the close decision, on May 8, 2010, at UFC 113 in Montreal, Canada, Machida and Rua rematched, seven months after their original fight. In the much anticipated rematch, both fighters started aggressively and scored significant points in striking exchanges, with Machida scoring two takedowns during the round. Rua showed strong defense on the ground, spinning to attempt a kneebar before both fighters returned to <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> a striking exchange, Rua swerved to avoid a left straight from Machida and landed a powerful counter overhand right to the temple, which knocked Machida down. Rua then took the full mount and proceeded to knock Machida out with ground-and-pound, making him the new Light Heavyweight Champion at 3:35 of round 1, with Machida suffering his first MMA career loss.|$|E
