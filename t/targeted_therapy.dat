40|$|Abstract Background <b>Targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> {{have become}} {{important}} treatment options for cancer care in many countries. This study aimed to examine recent trends in utilization of antineoplastic drugs, particularly {{the use of}} <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> for treatment of cancer, by geographic region in Taiwan (northern, midwestern, southern, and eastern regions and the outer islands). Methods This was a retrospective observational study of antineoplastic agents using 2009 - 2012 quarterly claims data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Yearly market shares by prescription volume and costs for <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> among total antineoplastic agents by region were estimated. We used multivariate regression model and ANOVA to examine variations in utilization of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> between geographic regions and used ARIMA models to estimate longitudinal trends. Results Population-adjusted use and costs of antineoplastic drugs (including <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies)</b> were highest in the southern region of Taiwan and lowest in the outer islands. We found a 4 -fold difference in use of antineoplastic drugs and a 49 -fold difference in use of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> between regions if the outer islands were included. There were minimal differences in use of antineoplastic drugs between other regions with about a 2 -fold difference in use of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies.</b> Without considering the outer islands, the market share by prescription volume and costs of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> increased almost 2 -fold (1. 84 - 1. 90) and 1. 5 -fold (1. 26 - 1. 61) respectively between 2009 and 2012. Furthermore, region was not significantly associated with use of antineoplastic agents or use of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> after adjusting for confounders. Region was associated with costs of antineoplastic agents {{but it was not}} associated with costs of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> after confounding adjustments. Conclusions Use of antineoplastic drugs overall and use of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies</b> for treatment of cancer varied somewhat between regions in Taiwan; use was notably low in the outer islands. Strategies might be needed to ensure access to cancer care in each region as economic burden of cancer care increase due to growing use of <b>targeted</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the <b>targeted</b> <b>therapy</b> drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for <b>targeted</b> <b>therapy</b> is the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome, a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|E
25|$|By common usage, {{the term}} {{chemotherapy}} {{has come to}} connote the use of rather non-specific intracellular poisons, especially related to inhibiting the process of cell division known as mitosis, and generally excludes agents that more selectively block extracellular growth signals (i.e. blockers of signal transduction). To avoid these connotations, recently developed therapies (against specific molecular or genetic targets) which inhibit growth-promoting signals coming from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer) are called hormonal therapies, while the inhibition of other growth-promoting influences (especially those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases) is known as <b>targeted</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
