5|$|According to C.H.O'D. Alexander: This {{game was}} notable for two things. First, Fischer played the Queen's Gambit {{for the first}} time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it <b>to</b> <b>perfection,</b> the game indeed casting doubt on Black's whole opening system.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near <b>to</b> <b>perfection</b> as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

25|$|The {{influential}} folklorist Cecil Sharp {{felt that}} these competing variants {{of a traditional}} song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological natural selection: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would {{be picked up by}} others and transmitted onward in time.

Patti, however, turned into a conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited her aging voice <b>to</b> <b>perfection</b> and she stuck to it.

Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas à Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while fighting a war in Moldavia. Helped by a private tutor, Udriște used that same book to learn Latin, which he could speak <b>to</b> <b>perfection.</b> In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udriște was fluent in Russian.
