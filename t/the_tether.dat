5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June the {{aircraft}} was demonstrated to Air Service officials. The le Rhone engines were not reliable and Žurovec had misgivings about the demonstration.

25|$|In hunting, Salticidae {{also use}} their silk for a tether {{to enable them}} to reach prey that {{otherwise}} would be inaccessible. For example, by advancing towards the prey to less than the jumping distance, then retreating and leaping in an arc at the end of <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> line, many species can leap onto prey on vertical or even on inverted surfaces, which of course in a gravitational field would not be possible without such a tether.|$|E

Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt resigns. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning.|$|E
25|$|LaMountain and Lowe {{had long}} argued over free flight and captive flight.

As a civilian he wore no uniform nor insignias. With each descent came the threat of being fired on, and to make each descent Lowe needed to release gas. In one instance Lowe was forced to land behind enemy lines and await being rescued overnight. After this incident he remained tethered to the ground by which he could be reeled in at a moment's notice. Besides, {{his use of the}} telegraph from the balloon car required a wire be run along <b>the</b> <b>tether.</b>|$|E

25|$|Project Wing is {{a project}} that aims to rapidly deliver {{products}} across a city by using flying vehicles, similar to the Amazon Prime Air concept.

At the end of <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> is a small bundle of electronics which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle.

25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, {{and the primary}} cell wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E

500|$|On {{their way}} to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach, they see that the ISS's crew has {{evacuated}} into one of its two Soyuz TMA capsules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz TMA-14M has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, [...] away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away to certain death. He continues to support her until he is out of communications range.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} over six levels called {{attraction}}s. Each attraction {{is divided into}} five acts; the fifth act ends in a boss fight with Robotnik. Like earlier Sonic games, the players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, as well as perform a spin dash {{on the ground to}} gain speed. Power-ups are placed throughout the attractions providing players with rings, shields, and speed shows, among other boons. The partner mechanic offers new actions not seen in earlier Sonic games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character, but this costs the player 10 rings. In addition, players can throw their partner, which can aid in getting to hard-to-reach platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player is given the ability to stop and anchor the computer partner to perform special moves. Using this, the player can [...] "snap up" [...] to a partner on a higher ledge if they are hanging below. They can also anchor the partner and build tension in <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> by moving away from them, then release them to gain a powerful speed boost. The game also employs a [...] "time of day" [...] mechanic; each level changes to a specific time of day (morning, noon, evening, and night), which affects enemy placement and boss difficulty.|$|E

40|$|A {{single-chain}} tethered dimer {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus protease (HIV-PR) was produced by expression of a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli. <b>The</b> <b>tethered</b> dimer, which consists of two 99 -amino acid HIV-PR subunits linked together by a pentapeptide, was isolated from inclusion bodies and refolded as an active protease with enzymatic properties {{very similar to those}} of the natural dimer at pH 5. 5. In addition to demonstrating that <b>the</b> <b>tethered</b> dimer is active, we have shown that <b>the</b> <b>tethered</b> dimer is more stable than the natural HIV-PR dimer at pH 7. 0. This is attributed to dissociation of the natural HIV-PR dimer, for which a surprisingly high dissociation constant, 5 X 10 (- 8) M was measured. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>tethered</b> dimer offers an opportunity to produce asymmetric dimer mutants and thereby determine the effect of changes in one of the two subunits on protease activity. In one such mutant, a single active-site aspartic residue was changed to a glycine residue. This protein was inactive, consistent with a requirement for an aspartic residue from each subunit to constitute an active site of HIV-PR...|$|R

The rigid and bulky nature of the cube induces interfacial curvature in <b>the</b> <b>tethered</b> NBB phases compared to their linear ABCABC triblock copolymer counterparts. We compare our results with those structures obtained from ABCABC diblock copolymer tethered nanospheres to further elucidate the role of cubic nanoparticle geometry on self-assembly...|$|R

2500|$|Once the vesicles {{pinch off}} from the ER they are transported passively (by diffusion) or {{actively}} (by intracellular motors that run on cytoskeletal tracks).

The program was said to be [...] "hanging by a thread" [...] after the incident.
