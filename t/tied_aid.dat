5000|$|<b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> {{increases}} {{the cost of}} assistance and has the tendency of making donors {{focus more on the}} commercial advancement of their countries than what developing countries need. When recipient nations are required to spend aid on products from the donor nation, project costs can be raised by up to 30 percent. [...] <b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> can create distortions in the market and impede the recipient country's ability to spend the aid they receive. There are growing concerns about the use of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> and efforts to analyze the quality of aid given, rather than simply the quantity. The Commitment to Development Index, which measures the [...] "development friendliness" [...] of rich countries, actually penalizes donor governments for <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> in the calculation of the index.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also much}} debate about {{evaluating}} {{the quality of}} development aid, rather than simply the quantity. For instance, <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. <b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.|$|E

40|$|This study tests two {{opposing}} hypotheses {{about the impact}} of aid fragmentation on the practice of <b>aid</b> <b>tying.</b> In one, when a small number of donors dominate the aid market in a country, they may exploit their monopoly power by <b>tying</b> more <b>aid</b> to purchases from contractors based in their own countries. Alternatively, when donors have a larger share of the aid market, they may have stronger incentives to maximize the development impact of their <b>aid</b> by <b>tying</b> less of it. Empirical tests strongly and consistently support the latter hypothesis. The key finding [...] that higher donor aid shares are associated with less <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> [...] is robust to recipient controls, donor fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation. When recipient countries are grouped by their scores on corruption perception indexes, higher shares of aid are significantly related to lower <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> only in the less-corrupt sub-sample. This finding is consistent with the argument that <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> can be an efficient response by donors when losses from corruption may rival or exceed losses from <b>tying</b> <b>aid.</b> When <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> is more costly, as proxied by donor country size and income, it is less prevalent. <b>Aid</b> <b>tying</b> is lower in the Least Developed Countries, consistent with the OECD Development Assistance Committee's recommendation to its members.

40|$|There {{exists in}} the {{literature}} a presumption that <b>tied</b> foreign <b>aid</b> can be used effectively to reduce cross-border pollution. Focusing, {{in contrast to the}} received literature, on the interaction between the public and private provisions of pollution abatement in the recipient country, we question the effectiveness of <b>tied</b> foreign <b>aid</b> in reducing pollution. In this context, we obtain many novel and policy relevant insights. Allowing for changes in labour employment and distinguishing between short and long run effects, <b>tied</b> foreign <b>aid</b> is shown to crowd out the private provision for pollution abatement in the short run. In the long run, <b>tied</b> foreign <b>aid</b> raises employment and therefore may be desirable for the recipient but undesirable for the donor country because it also raises pollution. The results change drastically if only the government provides pollution abatement. ...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in favour of untied aid is that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> can create important distortions in the market by {{limiting the number of}} countries where the recipient can make purchases. These limitations impede the recipient country’s ability to find the most cost-effective way to spend the aid they receive. It is estimated that goods and services purchased with <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with untied aid. Furthermore, <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> often favours capital-intensive goods and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise. That may lead recipient countries to make purchases which are inappropriate for realising their development goals.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> {{is defined}} as project aid {{contracted}} by source to private firms in the donor country. It refers to aid tied to goods and services supplied exclusively by donor country businesses or agencies. <b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> increases the cost of assistance and has the tendency of making donors {{to focus more on}} the commercial advancement of their countries than what developing countries need. There are many ways aid can be designed to pursue the commercial objectives of donors. One of such pervasive means is by insisting on donor country products.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a correct estimate on the related costs to the recipient for various reasons.

40|$|In {{line with}} their {{commitment}} to reduce public spending, the Conservative government under Thatcher cut the aid budget by some six per cent in real terms in their first five years in power, with {{the brunt of the}} cuts falling on bilateral aid. Business groups deplored this trend and argued that it be reversed because <b>tied</b> bilateral <b>aid</b> generated greater commercial benefits for the economy than multilateral aid, an argument which government ministers appeared to accept. We estimate and compare the impact of multilateral and <b>tied</b> bilateral <b>aid</b> on the UK economy in 1980 and 1985 using Input-Output impact analysis. The results suggest, quite strongly, that multilateral aid generates greater benefits both in volume terms and per equivalent amount of aid expenditure. We conclude that the case for the increased use of <b>tied</b> bilateral <b>aid</b> is weaker than commonly supposed. ...|$|R

5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesDirect haptic (force or tactile) {{feedback}} {{is not yet}} available in commercial robotic surgical systems. Previous work by our group and others suggests that haptic feedback might significantly enhance the execution of surgical tasks requiring fine suture manipulation, specifically those encountered in cardiothoracic surgery. We studied the effects of substituting direct haptic feedback with visual and auditory cues to provide the operating surgeon with {{a representation of the}} forces he or she is applying with robotic telemanipulators. MethodsUsing the robotic da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), we compared applied forces during a standardized surgical knot-tying task under 4 different sensory-substitution scenarios: no feedback, auditory feedback, visual feedback, and combined auditory-visual feedback. ResultsThe forces applied with these sensory-substitution modes more closely approximate suture tensions achieved under ideal haptic conditions (ie, hand ties) than forces applied without such sensory feedback. The consistency of applied forces during robot-assisted suture <b>tying</b> <b>aided</b> by visual feedback or combined auditory-visual feedback sensory substitution is superior to that achieved with hand <b>ties.</b> Robot-assisted <b>ties</b> <b>aided</b> with auditory feedback revealed levels of consistency that were generally equivalent or superior to those attained with hand ties. Visual feedback and auditory feedback improve the consistency of robotically applied forces. ConclusionsSensory substitution, in the form of visual feedback, auditory feedback, or both, confers quantifiable advantages in applied force accuracy and consistency during the performance of a simple surgical task...|$|R

The United Nations Human Development Report in 2005 estimated that only about 8 per cent of bilateral aid is 'tied', down from 27 per cent in 1990. This however varies from country to country with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway giving 100 per cent of their aid untied, and Canada, Austria and Spain giving less than 60 per cent. http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2005/pdf/HDR05_HDI.pdf ...|$|R

50|$|Others {{have argued}} that tying aid to donor-country {{products}} is common sense; it is a strategic use of aid to promote donor country’s business or exports. It is further argued that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> - if well designed and effectively managed - would not necessarily compromise the quality {{as well as the}} effectiveness of aid. However, this argument would hold particularly for programme aid, where aid is tied to a specific projects or policies and where {{there is little or no}} commercial interest. It must be emphasized, however, that commercial interest and aid effectiveness are two different things, and it would be difficult to pursue commercial interest without compromising aid effectiveness. Thus, the idea of maximizing development should be separated from the notion of pursuing commercial interest. <b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> improves donors export performance, creates business for local companies and jobs. It also helps to expose firms, which have not had any international experience on the global market to do so.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tied</b> <b>aid</b> {{is foreign}} aid {{that must be}} spent in the country {{providing}} the aid (the donor country) or {{in a group of}} selected countries. A developed country will provide a bilateral loan or grant to a developing country, but mandate that the money be spent on goods or services produced in the selected country. From this it follows that untied aid has no geographical limitations.|$|E
50|$|A common {{criticism}} {{in recent years}} is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of <b>tied</b> <b>aid,</b> donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Eritrea {{discovered}} {{that it would be}} cheaper to build its network of railways with local expertise and resources rather than to spend aid money on foreign consultants and engineers. US law, backed by strong farm interests, requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport. As a result, <b>tying</b> <b>aid</b> is estimated to increase the cost of aid by 15–30%. Oxfam America and American Jewish World Service report that reforming US food aid programs could extend food aid to an additional 17.1 million people around the world.|$|R

5000|$|In the OECD report The Tying of Aid it {{was found}} that the motivations for tying aid were both {{economical}} and political. From the economic point of view, the donor country aims to raise its own exports. However, the study found that the exports related to <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> were minimal. It referred to an earlier study that looked at the relation between exports from nine representative European donors and 32 representative developing countries. That study found that exports connected to <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> constituted about 4 percent of the total. The Tying of Aid thus concluded that the more important reason for the practice was political. Historical relations, trade relationships, geopolitical interests and cultural ties are all examples of the political motivations behind the tying of aid, but according to Jepma, they all boiled down to the same thing: Although most donors give aid to quite a wide variety of recipients, the importance they attach to individual recipients clearly differs: donors support countries with which they have, or hope to have, strong ties.|$|E
