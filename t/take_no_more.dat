25|$|What {{he did not}} {{describe}} in the book {{was that he had}} offered, if released, to <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> part in the campaign, nor give any information which might hurt the Boer cause. Just to hedge his bets, he also attempted to get himself re-classified as a military prisoner, as he had heard of a possible exchange of military prisoners. The Boers regarded him as a significant prisoner, because of his initiative in attempting to get the train moving and allowing the engine to escape, because of his reputation as a war correspondent, and because he was a minor member of the aristocracy whose father {{had been a member of}} the British government. Nonetheless, it transpired that the authorities were seriously considering the possibility of accepting his offer to withdraw from the war, which later gave rise to accusations he had broken his agreement when he resumed reporting after his escape.|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Vibbard {{suffered}} a rare mechanical breakdown on Monday, August 5, 1878, {{on a trip}} from Albany. Approaching the Poughkeepsie landing, her starboard paddleshaft broke. Her 400 passengers and their baggage were disembarked at Poughkeepsie, and a special train commissioned {{to enable them to}} complete their journey. Temporary repairs were meanwhile made to Chauncey Vibbard, allowing her to complete the passage to New York at a slow speed, where she arrived about 10 pm. Damage was estimated at between $2,000 and $2,500, and Chauncey Vibbard was laid up at the foot of 22nd Street New York for the installation of a new shaft, which was expected to <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a few days. To replace her during the repairs, the reserve steamer Armenia was quickly readied for service, a task which included the transfer of Chauncey Vibbards bar fixtures and furniture. This breakdown {{was the first time in}} 13 years of service that Chauncey Vibbard had missed a scheduled trip.|$|E

25|$|The taboos (Tanacross injih, Upper Tanana Ä¯hjih) are animistic forbidden. In {{addition}} to adhering to {{a code of}} behavior, people observed a variety of taboos designed to prevent misfortune or bad luck. Many of these taboos were associated with hunting or some other aspect of the food gathering process, thus underscoring {{the importance of these}} activities for survival of the group. Ravens, cranes, wolverines, foxes, otters, and dogs must never be eaten. The heads of caribou, moose, and Dall sheep may not be fed to the dogs; to do so would bring the hunter poor luck. Neither the bones nor the carcasses of fur-bearing animals may be fed to dogs, but must be cached in a safe place. Should the dogs get them tha hunter will <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> fur. Women of child-bearing age did not eat bear (Grizzly or Alaskan brown bear and black bear). Young boys could not eat fat from around an animal's eye until adulthood. No animals except dogs could be brought up as pets.|$|E
500|$|Bockscar {{took off}} from Tinian's North Field at 03:49. The mission profile {{directed}} the B-29s to fly individually to the rendezvous point, changed because of bad weather from Iwo Jima to Yakushima Island, and at [...] cruising altitude instead of the customary , increasing fuel consumption. Bockscar began its climb to the [...] bombing altitude a half hour before rendezvous. Before the mission, Tibbets had warned Sweeney to <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than fifteen minutes at the rendezvous before proceeding to the target. Bockscar reached the rendezvous point and assembled with The Great Artiste, but after circling for some time, The Big Stink failed to appear. As they orbited Yakushima, the weather planes Enola Gay and Laggin' Dragon reported both Kokura and Nagasaki within the accepted parameters for the required visual attack.|$|E
500|$|The VIII Corps {{continued}} its eastward advance {{well into the}} month of April, and was ordered to stop between Chemnitz and the Czechoslovakian border, where the corps would {{make contact with the}} Russians. The immediate problem was dealing with the prisoners of war. The Americans were almost overwhelmed by the number of Germans wanting to surrender to them, and despite orders to <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> prisoners, thousands of Germans filtered through VIII Corps lines at night, desperately trying to avoid capture by the Russians. [...] During the last week of April, a Russian cavalry unit made contact with Middleton. While the leaders of both the Americans and the Russians exchanged luncheon inviations, the Russians were extremely reluctant to allow any Americans across the Russian line, and their American lunch guests were taken by a very circuitous route into Russian-held territory.|$|E

500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro {{beat and}} {{elements}} of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline. Spears delivers confident and breathy vocals, in lyrics such as [...] "If {{you want this}} good shit / Sicker than the remix / Baby let me blow your mind tonight." [...] In the chorus, the song slows down while Spears sings [...] "I can't take it take it <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> / Never felt like felt like this before / Come on get me get me on the floor / DJ what you what you waiting for?". The melody's 4:3 cross-rhythm continues into a chant-like segment, in which [...] "whoa-oh-oh-oh" [...] is repeated. The bit was compared by Scott Shettler of AOL to the [...] "rapid word repetition" [...] of Kesha. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said the chorus [...] "comes on hard like it's the sexy spawn" [...] of American recording artist Usher's [...] "OMG" [...] (2010) and Italian band Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|Although Harrison had {{estimated}} in a New York radio {{interview that the}} solo album would <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than eight weeks to complete, recording, overdubbing and mixing on All Things Must Pass lasted for five months, until late October. Part {{of the reason for}} this was Harrison's need to make regular visits to Liverpool to tend to his mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer. Participants at the recording sessions identify Spector's erratic behaviour as another factor affecting progress on the album. Harrison later referred to Spector needing [...] "eighteen cherry brandies" [...] before he could start work, a situation that forced much of the production duties onto Harrison alone. In July 1970, by which time sessions had resumed at Trident Studios, Spector fell over in the studio and broke his arm. Early that month, work on All Things Must Pass was temporarily brought to a halt as Harrison headed north to see his dying mother for the last time. EMI's growing concerns regarding studio costs added to the pressure on Harrison, and a further complication, John Harris notes, was that Clapton had become infatuated with Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, and adopted a heroin habit as a means of coping with his guilt.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity {{and use of the}} three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the base metal five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government if presented in $100 lots pursuant to a provision in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as [...] "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a surplus of base metal coins often sold them at a discount.|$|E

500|$|... "Since Germans are the {{perennial}} disturbers of the world's peace ... {{they must be}} dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them. [...] The army groups, as organized units, would be the easiest and quickest to deal with. ... The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed territories, is about 70,000,000, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve the purpose of German extinction it would be necessary to only sterilize some 48,000,000 -- a figure which excludes, because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of age, and females over 45. ... Taking 20,000 surgeons as an arbitrary number and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations daily, it would <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one month, at the maximum, to complete their sterilization. ... The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly. Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance." ...|$|E
