5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming of}} Q4 {{presented}} a headache for Smallpeice, realising {{that he could}} not seek permission to call the ship the Queen Elizabeth II, as only Royal Navy battleships had been named after a reigning monarch. Smallpeice discussed the issue with the Queen's Private Secretary Sir Michael Adeane and it was agreed that they would recommend to Her Majesty that the ship be named Queen Elizabeth. This was in keeping with normal Cunard practice of reusing previous ships names and didn't present any issues as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new ships would not be in Cunard service at the same time. Elizabeth II launched the ship on 20 September 1967 but surprised and delighted Smallpeice and the invited guests when she named the ship Queen Elizabeth the Second. Smallpeice believed using the style Queen Elizabeth II wasn't entirely appropriate, it being the designation of the sovereign, and sought permission to use an Arabic 2 in place of Roman numerals.|$|E

5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{synthesised}} and transmitted {{the learning}} from his predecessors, {{as well as}} made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating {{the age of the}} earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome's Vulgate, which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by Basil, Cassian, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville, Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, Pope Gregory I, Ambrose of Milan, Cassiodorus, and Cyprian. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works. He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius's Life of Antony, and a copy of Sulpicius Severus' Life of St. Martin. He also used lesser known writers, such as Fulgentius, Julian of Eclanum, Tyconius, and Prosper of Aquitaine. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church. It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.|$|E
