5|$|Bart {{awakening}} {{and finding}} the head of Jebediah Springfield in bed next to him is {{a reference to the}} scene in The Godfather where Jack Woltz finds <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prize racehorse next to him one morning.|$|E
5|$|On the island, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) watches Eko whittling scripture into <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> club, and {{mentions}} that Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) carries a Virgin Mary statue. Eko immediately demands {{to see the}} statue, which he breaks open and shows Claire the heroin inside. Eko then goes to Charlie, demanding him {{to take him to}} the plane.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope so too, sir; {{but this}} chap, out here at north-west has a suspicious, lugger-like look. It {{may be that}} I see only <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> top-sails, but they are amazingly like luggs!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first sight}} that met my eyes, {{at the other}} end of the room, was the irrepressible Gooseberry, perched on a chair, and looking with breathless interest, over <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> elders, at <b>the</b> Sergeant's proceedings.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, Simeon I marched from Preslav {{through the}} Balkan Mountains and {{the valley of}} the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the Bulgarian forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a Bulgarian protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily gained control of the country and placed in power another Bulgarian candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the Bulgarian military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's stepmother, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure the {{succession}} of Antioch to her son, William. Leo, Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions. With her assistance, he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194. Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him, but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town. The commune proclaimed Bohemond III's elder son, Raymond, regent. Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army to help his brother, compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia. Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced his claim to suzerainty over Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Dominik died on 16 November 1910. That same year, Atangana {{returned}} to Jaunde and received an administrative post, perhaps {{as head of}} the Ewondo-Bane court, which presided over civil disputes and small claims and was the conduit through which the Germans transmitted communiqués (and gauged the response to them). However, he resigned the post when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sublineage died; Atangana took over as headman of the sublineage and Mvolyé village.|$|E

5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see {{a repeat of the}} event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E

5|$|Raymond, Prince of Antioch, and {{thousands}} of his soldiers fell in the Battle of Inab on 28June 1148, leaving the principality almost undefended. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem (who was the cousin of Raymond's widow, Constance, the ruling Princess of Antioch) came to Antioch at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army {{at least three times}} during the following years. To secure the defence of the principality, Baldwin tried to persuade her to remarry, but she did not accept his candidates. She also refused John Roger, whom the Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, proposed for her husband.|$|E
5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to exploit this victory or pursue the {{remnants}} of the Rus' army, since Bardas Phokas rose in revolt in Asia Minor. Bardas Skleros and his men were consequently withdrawn to Asia Minor, whilst Sviatoslav restricted his forces {{to the north of the}} Balkan Mountains. In the spring of the next year, however, with Phokas' rebellion subdued, Tzimiskes himself, at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, advanced north into Bulgaria. The Byzantines took the Bulgarian capital Preslav, capturing the Bulgarian tsar Boris II, and confined the Rus' in the fortress of Dorostolon (modern Silistra). After a three-month siege and a series of pitched battles before the city walls, Sviatoslav conceded defeat and abandoned Bulgaria.|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} {{response of}} the Old English community was to appeal directly to the King of Ireland in England, over <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> representatives in Dublin, effectively meaning {{that they had to}} appeal to their sovereign in his role as King of England, a necessity which further disgruntled them.|$|R
50|$|Sudarshana Chakra: The magical Chakra, a {{spinning}} disc with sharp outer spears. The Sudarshan flies at {{the command of}} Krishna, spinning away to tear off <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by His Avatar Krishna in the Mahabharata.|$|R
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a {{force of}} 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans. The Argives, assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies, launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them {{into a state of}} panic. Due to the labyrinthine layout {{of the city and the}} darkness, both Pyrrhus' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos. The result was that Pyrrhus, entering the city at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cavalry to assist the Gauls, was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers. Realising the difficulty of his situation, Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke.|$|E

5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> film department, to sack Brauer and bring in Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged {{that at the time}} when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.|$|E
