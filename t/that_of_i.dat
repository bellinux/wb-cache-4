60|$|I have {{examined}} one specimen of the hermaphrodite I. quadrivalvis, preserved in spirits from Kangaroo Island, and one dry from Adelaide, both places in South Australia, and four from an unknown locality, purchased from Mr. Sowerby; and within {{five out of}} these six specimens, males were attached. In one of them, two males of different ages were included, one adhering to the peduncle of the other: in I. Cumingii, also, it may be remembered, there {{was a case of}} two males parasitic on one female. I may add that I opened another quite young specimen, from Adelaide, not counted with the above, and it was without a male. The males in the five specimens were attached low down, at the rostral end, almost in a horizontal position, stretching across the bottom of the sack; one of them, however, was placed considerably on one side. One individual which I measured, was 16/100ths of an inch in length, and 5/100ths in width in the widest part, namely, about half down the peduncle. I may state, for the sake of comparison, that the hermaphrodite to which this individual was attached, was, including the peduncle and capitulum, one inch in length, that is, six times as long as the male, and one fifth of an inch in width, that is, four times as wide. The above measurements show that the male of this species is rather more than twice as large as <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>I.</b> Cumingii. In consequence of this greater size, I dissected, with the utmost care, the one specimen which was excellently preserved in spirits, and found every part, with a few exceptions, so exactly the same as in the male of I. Cumingii, only larger and more conspicuous, that it will be sufficient to indicate the few points of difference.|$|E

It has a similar distribution to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>I.</b> tuckermanii. It bears 9 to 35 mostly recurved leaves, each 5-21 cm long. The leaves are usually dark green, though can occasionally be tinged with red. The sporangium can be up to five millimeters long and 3 millimeters in length, covered one sixth to one third by the velum. The spherical megaspores are 400-570 micrometers in diameter, and bear smooth ridges. The kidney shaped microspores are 25 to 30 micrometers long. It was originally believed to be a member of Isoetes hieroglyphica because of their similar megaspore structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} hemicastration {{performed}} at various ages of bull calves, on testicular growth was studied in 27 animals. Hemicastration (HC) was performed from 10 to 190 days of age at monthly interval and the contralateral testis removed 60 days later. The bulls being hemicastrated served as controls (I) {{for the animals}} being castrated at that age. Body weight (BW), testicular weight (TW), epididymal weight (EW) and the relative weight (organ weight/body weight) of testis (RTW) and epididymis (REW) was determined every 60 days between 70 - 250 days. Body weight did not differ with treatment (P less than 0. 05), but increased with age from 40 to 250 days (P less than 0. 05). TW, EW and REW were not influenced by treatment at any age (P less than 0. 05). RTW of HC animals based on single testis, differed from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>I</b> (P=. 02) when hemicastration was performed at 70 days.
