5|$|The {{specific}} epithet oregonense {{derives from}} the name Oregon and the Latin suffix -ense (relating to), in reference to western Oregon being its central region of abundance.

5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> factors {{influence the}} prognosis in SAH.

The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E

5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed Darwinian evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued {{that there was a}} blueprint for existence and <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> memory was a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Hershey and Chase, {{along with}} others who had done related experiments, {{confirmed}} that DNA was the biomolecule <b>that</b> carried <b>genetic</b> information.

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over {{the relative importance of}} natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{concentrated}} on characterizing {{the structures of}} the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally of the antibody light chain, and their realization that this protein {{is the same as}} the Bence-Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones. Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulfide bond-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter. Together, these scientists deduced the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David Givol. While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (IgA); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka discovered IgE and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions. In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, Susumu Tonegawa showed <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E

5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show <b>that</b> <b>genetic</b> systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E
