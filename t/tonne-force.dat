50|$|The <b>tonne-force,</b> metric ton-force, megagram-force, and megapond (Mp) {{are each}} 1000 kilograms-force.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tonne-force</b> (tf or tf) {{is equal}} to the weight of one tonne.|$|E
5000|$|Like the gram and the kilogram, the tonne {{gave rise}} to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the <b>tonne-force,</b> {{equivalent}} to about 9.8 kilonewtons: a unit also often called simply [...] "tonne" [...] or [...] "metric ton" [...] without identifying it as a unit of force. In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the <b>tonne-force</b> or metric ton-force is not acceptable for use with SI, partly because it is not an exact multiple of the SI unit of force, the newton.|$|E
