50|$|Today {{anthropometry}} can {{be performed}} with <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners.</b> A global collaborative study to examine the uses of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners</b> for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners</b> to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether the Body Volume Index {{has the potential to}} be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65 kg.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>three-dimensional</b> foot <b>scanner</b> which can form images or three-dimensional data records of feet of human bodies {{and is used}} for the manufacturing shoe trees. The <b>three-dimensional</b> foot <b>scanner</b> comprises a foot scanning device and a foot image analysis system, wherein the foot scanning device is used for shooting a medial border image, a lateral border image and a sole image of a foot; and the foot image analysis system is used for analyzing the medial border image, the lateral border image and the sole image of the foot so as to acquire three-dimensional foot data. In the <b>three-dimensional</b> foot <b>scanner,</b> the medial border image, the lateral border image and the sole image of the foot are shot by a plurality of cameras, the images are corrected and spliced, integrated outlines of the medial border, the lateral border and the sole of the foot are extracted, and standard three-dimensional foot data is combined so as to generate a foot three-dimensional model. By using the <b>three-dimensional</b> foot <b>scanner,</b> the scanning time and production cost are greatly reduced on the premise of ensuring certain precision. 本发明涉及一种三维足部扫描仪，该三维足部扫描仪能形成人体足部的图像或三维数据记录，用于鞋楦的制作。该三维足部扫描仪包括：足部扫描装置，用于拍摄足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像；以及足部图像分析系统，用于对所述足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像进行分析以获取三维足部数据。本发明首先利用多个摄像头拍摄足部内侧、外侧和底部的图像，再对图像进行校正和拼接，并提取完整的足部内侧、外侧和底部轮廓，结合标准三维足部数据生成足部三维模型。本发明在保证一定精度的前提下，减少扫描所需时间，并且大大降低生产成本。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 张一帆Inventor name used in this publication: 马啸Title in Traditional Chinese: 三維足部掃描儀Chin...|$|R

50|$|A {{completely}} separate {{technology has}} been developed by physicist Carl Haber. Installed in the Library of Congress late in 2006, the IRENE System uses a two-dimensional camera rotating around the record and taking detailed photographs of the grooves. Software then uses the digital images to reconstruct the sound. IRENE often produces {{a large amount of}} hiss with the recording, but it is very capable of removing pops and clicks produced by scratches on the record surface. IRENE will only read lateral information (monophonic), but a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanner</b> project is underway that will handle stereophonic and quadraphonic records, in addition to historical hill-and-dale recordings. Detailed descriptive posters can be downloaded from the IRENE web site. These are not being developed for sale.|$|E
30|$|<b>Three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners</b> can be {{classified}} into two categories according to the light source they emit. One is a laser scanner, {{and the other is}} a raster scanner. The idea of a laser scanner started upon learning about the characteristics of lasers. Because of its low divergence, it can basically bring back the coordinates of the scanned objects in three-dimensional space. Compared with the raster scanner, it has faster transmission speed and more precise resolution, and it can continue to break points. But the laser also has a nondiffusion property, and a certain amount will bring about the qualitative radiation effects.|$|R

Commonly used methods include branch laser triangulation methods. The objectives {{of this study is to}} provide a method for laser triangulation. It was described in the measurement system.

The dental cast was scanned by a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanner</b> (D 100, Imetric 3 D, Courgenay, Switzerland) and analysed by the VAM software (Vectra 3 D, Canfield Scientific, Fairfield, NJ). The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanner</b> projects a pattern of structured light on the object {{and looks at the}} deformation of the pattern on the object. A camera looks at the shape of the pattern and calculates the distance of every point in the field of view. Data are collected in relation to an internal coordinate system; thus, the scanner creates a three-dimensional image.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{scanning}} {{is used in}} many fields: medicine, architecture, industry, reverse engineering.

30|$|Through {{the mapping}} {{experiment}} of the hand-held laser <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanner,</b> different materials were selected as experimental {{objects in the}} experiment, and <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanner</b> measurement technology was used to transform the scanned image into one data point after another and obtain it in a short time. Three-dimensional data were obtained by scanning {{the surface of a}} complex furniture, and then the scan data were converted into a common data format to simulate the model of the scanned object. Through analysis of the preparation part of the experiment, the different problems caused by different factors in the part were analyzed, and the solution office was finally found. Laser scanners have a great influence on the depth. For this experiment scanner, the best method is to disassemble the furniture into parts and scan to expose more surfaces. In scanning, the selection of objects should be carefully selected, and the undetectable surface should have as few patterns or different shapes as possible to facilitate later repair. The later data processing should not be focused on the overall repair.|$|E
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{efficiently}} estimating a three-dimensional curve and its derivatives, starting from a discrete and noisy observation of the curve. This problem is now arising in many applicative contexts, thanks to the advent of devices that provide three-dimensional images and measures, such as <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners</b> in medical diagnostics. Our research, in particular, stems from the need for accurate estimation of the curvature of an artery, from image reconstructions of three-dimensional angiographies. This need has emerged within the AneuRisk project, a scientific endeavour which aims to investigate the role of vessel morphology, blood fluid dynamics and biomechanical properties of the vascular wall, on the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms. We develop a regression technique that exploits free-knot splines in a novel setting, to estimate three-dimensional curves and their derivatives. We thoroughly compare this technique with a classical regression method, local polynomial smoothing, showing that three-dimensional free-knot regression splines yield more accurate and efficient estimates.

The study we have carried out clears up the advantages and problems generally encountered in the use of laser scanning techniques in architectural applications. In order to evaluate the potential of this new laser technology we used three different <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanners</b> in a survey of the façade of the Sanuti-Bevilacqua Palace, an historical landmark building found in Bologna (Italy). The instruments make use of different methods and are usually used in distinct sector; in particular, we wanted to test both instrumentations that make use of the “time of flight” system and triangulation system. In the following processing of the data, we gave particular importance to three-dimensional modelling working with the point cloud, but studying then the way to extract from this the two-dimensional graphic necessary for architecture.

With the turntable a 360 ° field of view can be reached even when using completely stationary, static sensors. Our software uses RGBD sensors for data acquisition, however it can be combined with other image sensors.
