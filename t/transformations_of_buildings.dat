With this visit, they sought to appreciate the architecture and art, with emphasis on the tombs of Pedro and Inês, whose history was written. Travellers of a higher status beneﬁted from the monastic hostel facilities, their table and their nectars. The travel literature they produced is of particular importance to evaluate the architectural <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> feel the life of the Abbey, their habits, customs and rituals, understand the organization of the productive landscape.

Therefore, it is essential to protect buildings and their characteristic features. In some respects, the theoretical expectations set out in restoration documents have been disregarded in practice, both nationally and internationally. With specific reference to Sardinian historic centers, the situation is particularly problematic. Indeed, here, more and more often, we are witnessing the mortification of traditional architecture with indiscriminate replacements in and <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> Paradoxically, if the depopulation of some centers on the one hand has favored their natural deterioration, on the other, it has assured the survival of their historical-cultural importance. Under these conditions, a study of the historic center of Villamassargia (a small village in the province of Cagliari) has been carried out. On-site analysis has led to the recognition of the historical significance of many buildings, buildings which till now had remained unidentified, with obvious negative consequences for their conservation...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and visco-elastic properties of K 2 Te 4 O 9 {{have been examined}} {{as a function of}} temperature, using neutron scattering and Brillouin light scattering, respectively. The neutron scattering data indicate that the coordination of tellurium by oxygen changes notably once the material is heated above the glass transition temperature. This and the associated decrease in elastic modulus are consistent with converting network building blocks from trigonal bipyramids to trigonal pyramids. The latter form chain-like structures that constitute a liquid characterized by a single relaxation mechanism. Structural relaxation in the liquid results in further decrease of its elastic storage capacity and in a maximum of dissipative losses due to viscous processes. The break-up of the glassy network, which is attributed to a frictionless <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> blocks, is distinct from the viscous relaxation of the liquid; their visco-elastic signatures can be observed in separate temperature intervals...|$|R
