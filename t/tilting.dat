5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, <b>tilting</b> multiple units. This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line. To supplement this, the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven <b>tilting</b> diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. The choice fell on Class 93, with fifteen units eventually delivered. This allowed all passenger trains on diselized lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4.

We show that an iterated <b>tilted</b> algebra induces an m-cluster <b>tilted</b> algebra. This m-cluster <b>tilted</b> algebra {{can be seen as}} a trivial extension of another iterated <b>tilted</b> algebra which is derived equivalent to the original one.

30|$|From the {{accelerogram}} on the surface, {{we could}} estimate the surface <b>tilt</b> {{by measuring the}} static offset appearing in the surface accelerogram, which was 2.2 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 radians down to the east (Figure  3 b, Table  1). We call this <b>tilt</b> SUF <b>tilt</b> to avoid potential confusion with DIF <b>tilt.</b> The SUF <b>tilt</b> change was larger than the DIF <b>tilt</b> change, but the <b>tilt</b> direction was again consistent with the DIF <b>tilt.</b> In the borehole accelerogram, the static offsets were not consistent among the three components, suggesting that these offsets were not caused only by <b>tilt</b> motion. Accordingly, we {{did not use the}} offset of the borehole accelerogram for the <b>tilt</b> estimation.|$|R

In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired within five years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer Siemens, further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for <b>tilting</b> of the tongue during use as <b>tilting</b> of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for <b>tilting</b> of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background One {{problem in}} the {{mobilization}} of patients with neurological diseases, such as spinal cord injury, is the circulatory collapse that occurs while changing from supine to vertical position because of the missing venous pump due to paralyzed leg muscles. Therefore, a <b>tilt</b> table with integrated stepping device (<b>tilt</b> stepper) was developed, which allows passive stepping movements for performing locomotion training in an early state of rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} if passive stepping and cycling movements of the legs during <b>tilt</b> table training could stabilize blood circulation and prevent neurally-mediated syncope in healthy young adults. Methods In the first experiment, healthy subjects were tested on a traditional <b>tilt</b> table. Subjects who had a syncope or near-syncope in this condition underwent a second trial on the <b>tilt</b> stepper. In the second experiment, a group of healthy subjects was investigated on a traditional <b>tilt</b> table, the second group on the <b>tilt</b> ergometer, a device that allows cycling movements during <b>tilt</b> table training. We used the chi-square test to compare the occurrence of near-syncope/syncope in both groups (<b>tilt</b> table/tilt stepper and <b>tilt</b> table/tilt ergometer) and ANOVA to compare the blood pressure and heart rate between the groups at the four time intervals (supine, at 2 minutes, at 6 minutes and end of head-up <b>tilt).</b> Results Separate chi-square tests performed for each experiment showed significant differences in the occurrence of near syncope or syncope based on the device used. Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> stepper/ <b>tilt</b> table) in experiment one (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher at the end of head-up <b>tilt</b> on the <b>tilt</b> stepper and on the <b>tilt</b> table there was a greater increase in heart rate (2 minutes after head-up <b>tilt).</b> Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> ergometer/tilt table) in experiment 2 (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher on the <b>tilt</b> ergometer at the end of head-up <b>tilt</b> and on the <b>tilt</b> table the increase in heart rate was significantly larger (at 6 min and end of head-up <b>tilt).</b> Conclusions Stabilization of blood circulation and prevention of benign syncope can be achieved by passive leg movement during a <b>tilt</b> table test in healthy adults. </p...|$|R
50|$|Published {{literature}} on ocular torsion in physiologic ocular counter-roll {{are usually not}} very clear {{on the type of}} head <b>tilt</b> inducing the torsion, i.e., initial head <b>tilt</b> causing a <b>tilt</b> in the SVV or the compensatory head <b>tilt</b> to realign SVV with the true vertical. It has been stated that the ocular torsion in physiologic ocular counter-roll appears in the opposite direction as that of the head <b>tilt</b> in contrast to the same direction of ocular torsion as the head <b>tilt</b> in pathologic ocular <b>tilt</b> reaction.|$|R
50|$|If in- stead of {{the actual}} head <b>tilt</b> (as {{compared}} to true vertical), {{the direction of the}} head <b>tilt</b> as interpreted by the brain (subjective head <b>tilt)</b> is given importance, then it is seen that the head <b>tilt</b> and ocular torsion are actually in the same direction in both the physiologic ocular counter-roll and the pathologic ocular <b>tilt</b> reaction. The subjective head <b>tilt</b> as interpreted by the brain in the presence of asymmetric signals from the inner ear neural afferents is the principal factor in determining the direction of ocular torsion in ocular <b>tilt</b> reaction.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to tests in Sweden, the X2 was tried {{out on the}} Randsfjord Line on 12 March 1993. The order for the units was placed on 23 February 1995, after NSB had received bids from ABB (that later merged with Daimler's train division to become ADtranz), AEG, Fiat Ferroviaria, Talbot, Linke-Hofmann-Busch, Siemens and Görlitz. During 1996, an X2 train was rented to test out performance on the Norwegian railway system, and {{for a short period}} put into service on the Sørland Line. The first Class 71 unit was delivered on 19 September 1997, and the last on 30 January 1998. The last unit, no. 71.16, was delivered with <b>tilting</b> mechanism to be used to test performance on the Norwegian railways, due to the similarities between Class 71 and Class 73. It could be seen during the winter on the challenging Bergen Line and Dovre Line. After a few years the <b>tilting</b> mechanism was removed.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the <b>tilting</b> mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the <b>tilting</b> mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock <b>tilting</b> towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or <b>tilting</b> the head forward.|$|E
