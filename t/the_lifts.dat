5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access to a bank of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{building}} has escalators. To get from either ticket {{hall to the}} platforms {{it is necessary to}} use <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> or spiral stairs. The southern {{building has}} lifts from street level down {{to the level of the}} southbound Northern line platform, the only step-free platform at the station.|$|E
5|$|Served {{mostly by}} a shuttle train and having low {{passenger}} numbers, {{the station and}} branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak hours from 1962 and discontinued in 1994, when the cost of replacing <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> was considered too high for the income generated.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis solves {{a design}} of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> platform for euro-pallets. The main {{content of the}} thesis is the design dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> table, design and calculation of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> drive and stress calculations of some loaded parts of the structure. The thesis includes an appendix with assembly drawing of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> platform and assembly drawing of the table frame...|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{completion}} of the parallel locks in 2001 <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> is still in use. The German Federal audit office, aware of <b>the</b> <b>lift's</b> current loss making status will probably bring about <b>the</b> <b>lift's</b> closure in <b>the</b> near future.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lift</b> {{operations}} team on Whistler's Harmony Express {{had been}} experiencing {{some problems with}} <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> during <b>the</b> day on Wednesday 18 February 2009. That night, a grooming machine operator found a chair had fallen from <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> at tower 11.|$|R
5|$|In October 1922, {{the ticket}} office was {{replaced}} by a facility in <b>the</b> <b>lifts.</b> Passenger numbers remained low: when the station was one of a number on the network considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and capable of carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E
50|$|The central {{stairwell}} weaves around <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> {{well and}} has terrazzo treads and landings and features a grooved silky oak handrail with scrolled ends. <b>The</b> original <b>lift</b> is encased within a decorative lattice metal cage and retains its original interior. <b>The</b> <b>lift</b> operator lever mechanism within <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> chamber has been dismantled.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{purchase}} of the DR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1902, the planned DR and B lines were merged with a third proposed route from the Great Northern and Strand Railway. The DR deep-level route was revised at its western end to continue to Earl's Court and surface to the east of Barons Court. The deep-level platforms were opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. A new surface building for <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP's distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, {{with income}} no longer meeting {{operational}} costs, the canal was leased to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. From 1854, the company started {{to pay a}} dividend to its shareholders of 0.2%. Just ten years later, an Act of Parliament was obtained to sell the canal to the railway company and to abandon the Somerset section of the canal. The transfer took place on 13 April 1865, and the tub-boat canal was closed in 1867. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> were dismantled, {{and most of the}} route sold back to the original landowners.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> to the Piccadilly line {{platforms}} {{were replaced by}} escalators, with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform {{are located in the}} disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of escalators, the GNP station building was taken out of use.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, Shepway District Council’s lease {{ran out and}} it {{was decided}} that <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> was too {{expensive}} to run. Campaigners subsequently protested against the closure of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> and in April 2010, it was announced that <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> was to be restored.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lift</b> was <b>the</b> {{subject of}} a general {{overhaul}} in 1980 and <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> cables were renewed in 1984/85.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>lift</b> {{coefficient}} of!a wing {{of small}} span at first shows a linear increase for the increasing angle of attack, {{but to a}} lesser degree then was to be expected according to the theory of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> line; thereafter <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient increases more rapidly than linearity, as contrasted with the the theory of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> line. <b>The</b> induced drag coefficient for a given <b>lift</b> coefficient, on <b>the</b> other hand, is obviously much smaller than it would be according to the theory. A mall change in the theory of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> line will cover these deviations...|$|R
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the {{driveway}} under {{the office building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway ran past mortuaries and storerooms to <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E
50|$|After {{the closure}} of <b>the</b> old <b>lift</b> it was decided in 1979 to develop <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> {{as part of the}} Westphalian {{industrial}} museum. <b>The</b> <b>lift</b> was restored and reconstructed without bringing it back into use. The lower dock of <b>the</b> old <b>lift</b> is used as a marina.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lift</b> {{is located}} {{in an area where}} there are {{extensive}} fields of sugar cane. The road reserve which forms the setting of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> comprises a wide strip of mown grass. There is a patch of dense bush located to the east of <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Phantoms {{could be}} ordered with <b>the</b> {{wheelchair}} <b>lift</b> in either <b>the</b> front door or rear door. Those with <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> in <b>the</b> rear door had a slightly wider rear door to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b> Most Phantoms were ordered with <b>the</b> wheelchair <b>lift</b> in <b>the</b> front door.|$|R
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing <b>the</b> <b>lifts.</b> The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which cost only 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they had to walk between the trains and <b>the</b> <b>lifts.</b> Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
25|$|Machinery {{powered by}} a water wheel and a steam engine was used to pump out the mine, operate <b>the</b> <b>lifts,</b> and operate the {{grinding}} mills where the gold was separated from the ore.|$|E
50|$|A {{ballonet}} is an air bag {{inside the}} outer envelope of an airship which, when inflated, reduces the volume available for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> gas, {{making it more}} dense. Because air is also denser than <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> gas, inflating <b>the</b> ballonet reduces <b>the</b> overall <b>lift</b> while deflating it increases lift. In this way, the ballonet {{can be used to}} adjust <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> as required.|$|R
50|$|Separating the fill {{process from}} <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> process {{is crucial in}} this system. After the void is filled with sand, <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> occurs. <b>The</b> {{concrete}} is <b>lifted</b> about ½ - ¾ inches and the filling process resumes. When the void is full the process starts again with <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> and repeating <b>the</b> iterations {{as many times as}} is necessary.|$|R

25|$|All buses in the TransLink fleet are accessible, {{with most}} being low-floor {{vehicles}} that have ramps, although some are high-floor vehicles that have specially designed lifts. However, some stops are considered inaccessible {{if there is}} insufficient room to deploy <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> or ramps.|$|E
25|$|After 8 November 2009, the Rautatientori station, {{under the}} Central Railway Station, {{was closed to}} the public because a burst water pipe flooded it. After renovations, the station reopened for public use on 15 February 2010. <b>The</b> <b>lifts</b> were still under renovation, but they also reopened for service on 21 June 2010.|$|E
25|$|The main {{passenger}} footbridge {{has many}} paintings resembling frescoes and depicting romantic versions of rail travel. A second bridge fitted with lifts provides disabled access. When <b>the</b> <b>lifts</b> {{are out of}} action a member of station staff escorts people across a foot crossing at track level towards {{the south of the}} station.|$|E
50|$|Wingtip {{vortices}} {{modify the}} airflow around a wing, reducing wing's {{ability to generate}} lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for <b>the</b> same <b>lift,</b> which tilts <b>the</b> total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the drag component of that force. The angular deflection is small and has little effect on <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b> However, there {{is an increase in}} the drag equal to the product of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> force and <b>the</b> angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of <b>the</b> <b>lift,</b> <b>the</b> additional drag is proportional to the square of <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{trials of}} {{elevator}} finished in July 2016, the first cargo ship was lifted in July 15, <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> time comprised 8 minutes.Shanghai Daily {{reported that the}} first operational use of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> was on September 18, 2016, when limited [...] "operational testing" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> began.|$|R
40|$|The {{method for}} {{determination}} of <b>the</b> spanwise <b>lift</b> distribution {{is based on}} the Fourier series for the representation of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> distribution. <b>The</b> <b>lift</b> distribution, as well as the angle of attack, is split up in four elementary distributions. The insertion of the angle-of-attack distribution in the Fourier series for <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> distribution gives a compound third series which is of particular advantage for the determination of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> distribution. <b>The</b> method is illustrated in an example and supplemented by a graphical method. Lastly, the results of several comparative calculations with other methods are reported...|$|R
