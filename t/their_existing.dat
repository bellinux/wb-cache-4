5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit.

5|$|By 2011 Snapdragon was {{embedded}} in Hewlett Packard's WebOS devices {{and had a}} 50% market share of a $7.9 billion smartphone processor market. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 (Krait core) had taken a dominant share from other Android system-on-chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips powered 41% of smartphones. By 2015, Snapdragon was used in most non-Apple smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to rush out a competing 64-bit solution, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800/801/805, since <b>their</b> <b>existing</b> Krait cores were only 32-bit. The first 64-bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved <b>their</b> <b>existing</b> programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC programming to Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift <b>their</b> <b>existing</b> MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels.
