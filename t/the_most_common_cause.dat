5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{of severe}} disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of infection in this population, as well as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism {{is a state of}} insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E

5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{in the developed}} world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually {{does not affect the}} production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{of primary}} hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In {{areas of the}} world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

In the United States and the United Kingdom paracetamol is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity.

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause),</b> the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of COPD, with {{factors such as}} air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, {{one of the common}} sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much {{with the use of a}} bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
