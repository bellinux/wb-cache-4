5000|$|The <b>TrackBack</b> {{specification}} {{was created}} by Six Apart, which first implemented it in its Movable Type blogging software in August 2002. The <b>TrackBack</b> has since been implemented in most other blogging tools. Six Apart started a working group in February 2006 to improve the <b>Trackback</b> protocol with the goal to eventually have it approved as an Internet standard by the IETF. One notable blogging service that does not support <b>trackback</b> is Blogger. Instead, Blogger provides [...] "backlinks", which allow users to employ Google's search infrastructure to show links between blog entries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trackback</b> Submitter {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular link {{building}} tools used by spammers and users of black hat SEO. It abuses the feature called <b>Trackback</b> which allow bloggers to request notification when somebody links to one of their documents. Developed by an unknown spammer from Europe in September 2006, <b>Trackback</b> Submitter became very popular because of its ability to bypass comment spam protection used on popular blogging systems like WordPress.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>Trackback</b> Submitter {{was covered}} on Search Engine Journal and other popular SEO blogs, its {{popularity}} increased dramatically and some blog owners {{were forced to}} disable <b>trackback</b> feature or moderate each comment to prevent this software from hacking their spam protection plugins like Spam Karma and others.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} of the booming {{blogosphere}} the term became important and useful to describe the emerging new content structures that were enabled by new technologies (like <b>trackbacks,</b> pings and increasingly RSS), new types of CMS-software and -interfaces (like blogs and wikis), and not least by new socio-cultural practices (people creating, bringing into circulation and re-using/re-mixing microchunks of content).|$|R

5000|$|Blogs {{are also}} highly used in social {{computing}} concepts {{in order to}} understand human behaviors amongst online communities through a concept called social network analysis. Social network analysis (SNA) is [...] "a discipline of social science that seeks to explain social phenomena through a structural interpretation of human interaction both as a theory and a methodology". There are certain links that occur in blogs, weblogs in this case, where they have different functions that portray different types of information such as Permalink, Blogrolls, Comments, and <b>Trackbacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed {{a variety of}} digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, <b>trackbacks,</b> and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.|$|R
2500|$|Blogosphere: The {{collective}} {{community of}} all blogs and blog authors, particularly notable and widely read blogs, {{is known as}} the blogosphere. Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked, through blogrolls, comments, linkbacks (refbacks, <b>trackbacks</b> or pingbacks), and backlinks. Discussions [...] "in the blogosphere" [...] are occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues. Because new, untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge {{in the space of a}} few years, Internet marketers pay close attention to [...] "trends in the blogosphere".|$|R
50|$|Some {{individuals}} or companies have abused the <b>TrackBack</b> feature to insert spam links on some blogs. This {{is similar to}} comment spam but avoids some of the safeguards designed to stop the latter practice. As a result, <b>TrackBack</b> spam filters similar to those implemented against comment spam now exist in many weblog publishing systems. Many blogs have stopped using trackbacks because dealing with spam became {{too much of a}} burden.|$|E

40|$|Social media {{systems such}} as blogs, photo and link sharing sites, wikis and on-line forums are {{estimated}} to produce up to one third of new Web content. One thing that sets these ”Web 2. 0 ” sites apart from traditional Web pages and resources {{is that they are}} intertwined with other forms of networked data. Their standard hyperlinks are enriched by social networks, comments, <b>trackbacks,</b> advertisements, tags, RDF data and metadata. We describe recent work on building systems that analyse these emerging social media systems to recognize spam blogs, find opinions on topics, identify communities of interest, derive trust relationships, and detect influential bloggers. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to specify the {{influencer}} and the influential terms in consumer package goods by using the influence diffusion model (IDM).

The model {{was applied to the}} official data from a blog hosting service. The results of the model were compared with the term frequency (TF). Then, the influencers of the IDM were examined and compared with the results of other network indices such as number of links and <b>trackbacks.</b> The results indicate that IDM performs better in finding blogs posted by bloggers with product usage experience or with an interest in the product. A propagation network which visualizes the consumer-oriented key marketing elements is also presented. An empirical analysis suggests the validity of IDM for marketing decision marking...|$|R

50|$|A linkback is {{a method}} for Web authors to obtain {{notifications}} when other authors link {{to one of their}} documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to, or referring to, their articles. The four methods (Refback, <b>Trackback,</b> Pingback and Webmention) differ in how they accomplish this task.|$|E
5000|$|Trackbacks {{are used}} {{primarily}} to facilitate communication between blogs; if a blogger writes a new entry commenting on, or referring to, an entry found at another blog, and both blogging tools support the <b>TrackBack</b> protocol, then the commenting blogger can notify the other blog with a [...] "TrackBack ping"; the receiving blog will typically display summaries of, and links to, all the commenting entries below the original entry. This allows for conversations spanning several blogs that readers can easily follow.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{paper will}} be {{sketching}} out a constructivist {{approach to learning}} with microcontent, with special regard to new web technologies emerging in the “blogosphere”, the networked space created by weblogs and widened by many new web services that help to assign metadata to objects, or to construct social networks and webs of trust {{through the use of}} personal publishing or social networking platforms. Especially new "tagging " technologies and practices, creating "soft" metadata, show a possible way to new kinds of collaborative knowledge environments. It will be shown that is not only microcontent itself, but also its contextualization through learnercentered approaches, discussion through <b>trackbacks</b> or commentaries, and “soft ” object metadata which contribute to an understanding of microlearning and provide insights for implementing personal publishing systems in (educational) institutions. Until now, most of these conceptions are emergent on the web, so future research would have to identify possible uses and integration into learning environments and didactical applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Blogging {{has become}} a useful {{way for people to}} publish data on the Internet, which {{contains}} posts, comments, <b>trackbacks</b> etc. They can also share latest news and opinions. As several blogs have risen up on the web, the users have the problem to identify which of the blogs contain useful information & data. My attempt in this paper is to present a road map in ranking blogs. In the first blush, it appears that this exercise is the same as ranking the general web ranking but actually the blogs in Blogosphere are not amenable to using these same algorithms. An approach based on social connectivity between bloggers i. e. Relationships among bloggers and different important features could help in enhancing blog quality. In our approach we are adding “Time ” Factor by analyzing these blogs relationships at different time intervals would help us to identify the impact of blogs in Blogosphere...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the Digital Typhoon project, whose {{goal is to}} establish the study of meteoinformatics and to develop emergency information systems {{in the domain of}} typhoon-related information. We first propose the models of emergency information systems and uses “flat-source model” as the model of emergency information systems, and explain the concepts of information aggregation, recombination, and delivery, and describe how we used these concepts in the implementation of our web site named Digital Typhoon [1]. The basic principle of information recombination is the relationship that data plus context equals information, and we introduce the notion of context generation with real examples. Next information aggregation deals with content management systems for aggregating information comparing Weblog and Wiki, and we hypothesize that the effective emergency information aggregation systems need to have the hub of information, following the proposal of our information aggregation system using weblog <b>trackbacks.</b> Finally information delivery describes information needs and delivery tools for Digital Typhoon, which received more than 13 million page views since July 2003...|$|R
