25|$|The TECP {{humidity}} sensor {{is a relative}} {{humidity sensor}}, {{so it must be}} coupled with a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> in order to measure absolute humidity. Both the relative humidity sensor and a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> are attached directly to the circuit board of the TECP and are, therefore, assumed to be at the same temperature.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins.

40|$|The {{existing}} methods {{only allowed}} {{to determine the}} dynamic or average characteristics of specific copies of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> as the airflow test results of {{a limited number of}} specific copies of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> were carried out on a certified airflow equipment. The actual operating conditions of aircraft gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> significantly differ from those at airflow equipment. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop methods of recalculation of a test results of a limited number of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> that were received at certified airflow equipment and to get nominal dynamic characteristics of a particular type of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> in the anticipated operating conditions. This study offers the algorithm for the identification of the nominal dynamic characteristics of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> that are used to measure the temperature of gases in aircraft gas turbine engines. The algorithm makes it possible to 1) register the transient characteristics of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> of a particular type at a predetermined rate of air flow, 2) calculate the heat transfer coefficient between the gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> and the air flow at each airflow rate, 3) measure the average transient characteristics of the gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> at each airflow rate, 4) set the parameters of the hyperbolic function of the nominal variables of the time constants of selected gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> from the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated based on the expected operating conditions of the gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> The result of the study was that the parameters of the hyperbolic function of the nominal variables of the time constants for the dynamic model of the second order gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> were found. The developed method makes it possible to predict the dynamic performance of the specific types of gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> in the expected operating conditions.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{state-of-the-art}} in IC <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> It starts by revisiting the semiconductor theory of thermodiodes and thermotransistors, continues {{with the introduction}} of IC <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> the concepts of VPTAT - voltage proportional to absolute temperature and IPTAT (current proportional to absolute temperature) and discusses the possibility of use of parasitic bipolar transistors as <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> in pure CMOS technology. The next section demonstrates the very high operating temperature of a dasiaspecialpsila thermodiode, well beyond the typical IC silicon junction temperature. This is achieved with a diode embedded in an SOI CMOS micro-hotplate. A discussion on the temperature limits of integrated <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> is also given.

25|$|On 11 May 2010, {{details from}} the cockpit voice {{recorder}} were leaked {{to the public and}} released by Spanish media.

The BBC reported that the judge investigating the crash was to question three mechanics on suspicion of manslaughter.

25|$|The bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain {{under the direction of}} William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> and to handle electrostatic discharge.|$|E
25|$|A pair of {{inertial}} sensors {{inside the}} controller, a three-axis linear accelerometer and a three-axis angular rate sensor, {{are used to}} track rotation as well as overall motion. An internal magnetometer is also used for calibrating the controller's orientation against the Earth's magnetic field to help correct against cumulative error (drift) by the inertial sensors. In addition, an internal <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> is used to adjust the inertial sensor readings against temperature effects. The inertial sensors {{can be used for}} dead reckoning in cases which the camera tracking is insufficient, such as when the controller is obscured behind the player's back.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} week of February 2012, {{temperatures}} inside reactor No. 2 became unstable. On 7 February, the amount of cooling water was increased from 10.5 tons to 13.5 tons per hour. After a slight initial decrease in <b>temperature,</b> <b>sensor</b> readings again showed the temperature rising at some locations {{in the bottom of the}} reactor. On 11 February, temperatures rose once again. On 12 February, the temperature rose to 78.3°C (172.94°F). TEPCO denied the possibility of the core going critical again, because that would produce xenon, which was still below detectable levels. To prevent any possible nuclear criticality, TEPCO planned to dump boric acid into the reactor and to increase the volume of cooling water by 3 tons per hour.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|Every wet {{chemistry}} cell has 26 chemical sensors and a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> The polymer Ion Selective Electrodes {{were able to}} determine the concentration of ions by measuring the change of electric potential within the sensor, which is separated from the {{wet chemistry}} cell by an ion selective membrane. The two gas sensing electrodes for oxygen and carbon dioxide work on the same principle and are separated from the wet chemistry cell by a gas permeable membrane. A gold micro-electrode array {{is used for the}} Cyclic voltammetry and Anodic Stripping Voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is a method to study ions by applying a waveform of varying potential and measuring the current-voltage curve. Anodic Stripping Voltammetry first deposits the metals onto the gold electrode with an applied potential. After the potential is reversed, the current is measured while the metals are stripped off the electrode.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E
25|$|Maricello {{was pushing}} hard but {{lost control of}} his car at the R Bend and {{collided}} heavily with the barriers. He retired from the race and this put pressure off Félix da Costa who made use of his situation {{to close the gap}} to Lynn. Sims was running strongly but backed off at about lap ten {{as a result of an}} engine <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> problem which he corrected by short shifting and pulling out off Derani's slipstream. Félix da Costa reduced the deficit to Lynn to just over one second with four laps left in the event. He got this gap down to 1.3 seconds under yellow flag conditions for Wolf's stranded car at Lisboa corner, but was unable to get close to affect an pass on Lynn who maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to win. Lynn became the seventh driver to have won the Macau Grand Prix for Theodore Racing. The previous year's winner Félix da Costa finished second, 1.173 seconds in arrears, while Derani completed the podium in third place. Off the podium, Sims finished in fourth position. King led Carlin teammates Jaafar and Sainz in the next three places. Blomqvist came from the back of the field to finish eighth with Latifi ninth. Ocon recovered from his race start stall to complete the top ten. Outside the top ten, Sekiguchi was eleventh and led fellow countryman Nakayama in twelfth.
