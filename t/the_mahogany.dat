5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought <b>the</b> <b>mahogany</b> dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is <b>the</b> <b>mahogany</b> dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E

A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E

25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the region}} is mostly tropical but differences in topography, soil and climatic conditions increase species diversity. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are endemic. For example, guaiac wood (Guaiacum officinale), the flower {{of which is the}} national flower of Jamaica and the Bayahibe rose (Pereskia quisqueyana) which is the national flower of the Dominican Republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both Puerto Rico and Guatemala. <b>The</b> <b>mahogany</b> is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize.
