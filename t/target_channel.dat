40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} how to determine an optimal <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> sequence with the minimum cumulative handoff delay in cognitive radio networks. When the secondary user encounters multiple spectrum handoffs during its trans-mission period, {{the effects of}} multiple interruptions from the high-priority primary users and the traffic statistics of both the primary and the secondary users should be incorporated {{in the design of}} the optimal target sequence. The optimal <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> sequence can guild the secondary user to change its operating channel when the primary user’s interruptions occur. With M candidate channels and L elements in the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> sequence for spectrum handoffs, the exhaustive search (ES) requires time complexity of O(ML). In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm with time complexity of O(LM 2) to determine an optimal <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> sequence. Furthermore, we propose a greedy algorithm with time complexity of O(M) and prove that the greedy algorithm only requires comparing six <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> sequences. Numerical results show that the low-complexity greedy algorithm can yield similar cumulative handoff delay performance as the optimal DP-based or ES-based algorithms in most cases except when the primary users ’ service time distributions at their operating channels are different.

30|$|In the {{secondary}} system, SUs can monitor the real-time {{situation of the}} shared channels by periodic spectrum sensing. Once there is no spectrum hole, {{the secondary}} system will inform a waiting signaling to the primary system through the spectrum broker. After receiving this signaling, the PU who is ready to transmit will wait {{for a period of}} time and inform the secondary system the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> that it reclaims. The SU in the specific channel will vacate the channel immediately after it finishes the ongoing transmission. If the channel can be released before the PU's waiting time is due, then the PU can access the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> and the PU's service is only deferred. Otherwise, the PU will be blocked. Once the SUs sense that there appears a spectrum hole (a SU or PU in service left), the waiting signaling is canceled for PUs in the primary system via the spectrum broker. In the situation without waiting signaling, the proposed mechanism works in the same way as the preemptive mechanism.|$|E

However, the user {{of these services}} experiences longer delays than the traditional analog TV while switching from channel to channel. The digital TV operator usually displays a black screen with the channel number during zapping.

It is found that, for longer zapping times, advertisements give better QoE than the black screen. However, when zapping times are small, users prefer a black screen over a glance of an advertisement picture. Based upon our findings we propose a system for optimal zapping experience.

40|$|Modern radar {{include more}} and more {{multiple}} functions and multiple channels; in this context sophisticated waveforms [1] and related processing (pulse compression, extraction of information) are an hot research and development topic. A simple multifunction radar concept includes the detection of air targets (<b>target</b> <b>channel)</b> and the analysis of atmospheric phenomena, mainly: precipitation (weather channel). In a weather channel {{the design of the}} waveforms to implement pulse compression techniques requires a low ISR (Integrated Sidelobe Ratio) – i. e. less than - 30 dB in some cases – while in the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> a low PSR (Peak Sidelobe Ratio) is needed. Possible novel solutions to this, and the other problems of multifunction radar, exploit the complementary properties of Golay codes to implement pulse compression: the encoded pulses have to be transmitted simultaneously and at the same carrier frequency. To separate them in reception, their sub-pulses can be further encoded by two orthogonal codes respectively (nested orthogonal codes into the complementary codes). The performances of this technique will be evaluated in term of ISR and PSR, with respect to the Doppler shift and to the compression rati...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} binary {{hypothesis}} test of detecting {{the presence or}} absence of a target in a highly cluttered environment by using time reversal. In time reversal the backscatter of a signal transmitted into a scattering environment is recorded, delayed, energy normalized, and retransmitted through the medium. We consider two versions of the test—target channel frequency response assumed known or unknown—and, for each version, contrast two approaches: conventional detection (where no time reversal occurs) and time reversal detection. This leads to 4 alternative formulations for which we derive the optimal detector and the generalized likelihood ratio test, when the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> frequency response is known or unknown, respectively. We derive analytical expressions for the error probabilities and the threshold for all detectors, with the exception of the time reversal generalized likelihood ratio test. Experiments with real world electromagnetic data for two channels (free space with a target immersed in 20 scatterers; and a duct channel) confirm the analytical results and show that time reversal detection provides significant gains over conventional detection. This gain is explained by the empirical distribution or type of the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> frequency response—richer scattering channels induce types with heavier tails and larger time reversal detection gains...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper studies {{detection}} {{of a target}} buried in a rich scattering medium by time reversal. We use a multi-static configuration with receive and transmit arrays of antennas. In time reversal, the backscattered field is recorded, time reversed, and retransmitted (mathematically or physically) into the same scattering medium. We derive two array detectors: the time-reversal channel matched filter when the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> response is known; and the time-reversal generalized-likelihood ratio test (TR-GLRT) when the <b>target</b> <b>channel</b> response is unknown. The noise added in the initial probing step to the time-reversal signal makes {{the analysis of the}} TR-GLRT detector non trivial. The paper derives closed form expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio gain provided by this detector over the corresponding conventional clutter subtraction energy detector in the two extreme conditions of weak and strong (electronic additive) noise and shows that time reversal provides, under weak noise, the optimal waveform shape to probe the environment. We analyze the impact of the array configuration on the detection performance. Finally, experiments with electromagnetic data collected in a multipath scattering laboratory environment confirm our analytical results. Under the realistic conditions tested, time reversal provides detection gains over conventional detection that range from 2 to 4. 7 dB.
