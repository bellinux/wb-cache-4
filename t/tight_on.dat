5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The secondhalf was dominated by Texas as they scored fiveunanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of tworushing touchdowns by Vince Young, tworushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21-yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> the nest, with fatal results.|$|E

5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands.

500|$|The opening chase scene, {{involving}} Gosling's character, {{was filmed}} primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he revealed {{the idea for}} this scene was to emulate {{the feeling of a}} [...] "diver in an ocean of sharks," [...] never leaving the vehicle during a car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view. <b>Tight</b> <b>on</b> money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere, which was helped by the scene being shot at low-angles with minimal light.|$|E
500|$|The Orioles {{planned to}} retire Ripken's #8 in a {{ceremony}} before the final home game of the 2001 season, in late September. Ripken's final game was originally set to be played at Yankee Stadium; however, the September 11, 2001 attacks led to the postponement of a week's worth of games. The games missed were added onto {{the end of the}} season's schedule. Since all the games the Orioles missed were at home, this changed the location of Ripken's final game to Oriole Park, much to the delight of Orioles fans. On October 6, Ripken ended his career in the on-deck circle {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning. Longtime teammate Brady Anderson, also playing in his last game for the Orioles, swung and missed on a fastball high and <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> a 3–2 count to end the game. After the game, Ripken gave a speech thanking the fans for their support over 20 seasons. Ripken was healthier in his final season than he had been over his last two, as he appeared in 128 games. He batted a career-low [...]239 with 14 home runs and 68 RBI.|$|E

500|$|Most reviewers {{praised the}} risk of {{changing}} up the gameplay of Guitar Hero with the new controller design, contrasting to Rock Band 4s reliance on its established gameplay mechanics. Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the change a reinvention of the series, and though he had to relearn {{how to play the}} controller, enjoyed the experience and [...] "the increased emphasis on chords and fancy finger-work". Griffin McElroy of Polygon also praised the new controller, finding that the higher difficulties in the game present [...] "the most challenging fake guitar-playing" [...] that he's seen, and having to relearn the new playing style through the game's difficulties levels was a [...] "delight". Matt Miller of Game Informer found the six-button layout was not any better than the traditional five-button one, but [...] "nails a different dynamic" [...] as it feel like one was playing more realistic guitar chords. Though Game Revolutions Nick Tan was impressed with the challenge of the new controller, he felt the buttons themselves were too small and <b>tight</b> <b>on</b> the neck of the controller, and the new challenge may cause more casual players to forgo attempt to learn the new system and go back to Rock Band and the traditional layout.|$|E
