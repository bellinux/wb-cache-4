5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} {{another type of}} {{curvilinear}} triangle, but one in which <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> replacing each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mathematician}} {{to discover}} the existence of curves of constant width, and to observe that the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled De curvis triangularibus, Euler studied curvilinear triangles as well as <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> of constant width, which he called orbiforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E

50|$|Given b<a+c, {{the shape}} of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is {{determined}} by the relative magnitude of b and d. If d is imaginary, that is if a2+b2 <c2 then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has <b>the</b> form of a figure eight. If d is 0 then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is a figure eight with two branches of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> having a common horizontal tangent at the origin. If 0<d<b then <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has two additional double points at ±d and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> crosses itself at these points.

A special case of this is a=c, b=√2c which produces the lemniscate of Bernoulli. Finally, if d>b then the points ±d are still solutions to the Cartesian equation of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> does not cross these points and they are acnodes. <b>The</b> <b>curve</b> again has a figure eight shape though the shape is distorted if d is close to b.|$|R
5|$|The track route {{was built}} under {{supervision}} of Sigurd Lund and Carl Venderboe in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by Cattani. The only fixed installation was a water main which {{ran along the}} track, using Øvresetertjern as its water source. Engineer Luigi Angelini from Switzerland was hired to supervise the construction of <b>the</b> <b>curves,</b> which cost NOK615,000. The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and then for the Olympics in 1952.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three or more of <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, {{and there may be}} {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the line was limited {{by a lack of}} funds. Russell asked the LNWR to adopt the line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of turntables, and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E

50|$|For smooth or {{polygonal}} <b>curves,</b> <b>the</b> Jordan <b>curve</b> theorem can {{be proved}} in a straightforward way. Indeed <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has a tubular neighbourhood, {{defined in the}} smooth case by the field of unit normal vectors to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> or in <b>the</b> polygonal case by points {{at a distance of}} less than ε from the curve.In a neighbourhood of a differentiable point on <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> there is a coordinate change in which <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> becomes <b>the</b> diameter of an open disk. Taking a point not on <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> a straight line aimed at <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> starting at <b>the</b> point will eventually meet the tubular neighborhood; the path can be continued next to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> until it meets the disk. It will meet it on one side or the other. This proves that the complement of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has at most two connected components. On the other hand using the Cauchy integral formula for the winding number, {{it can be seen that}} the winding number is constant on connected components of the complement of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> is zero near infinity and increases by 1 when crossing <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Hence <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has exactly two components, its interior and the unbounded component. The same argument works for a piecewise differentiable Jordan curve.|$|R
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} {{track was}} built for the 1952 Winter Olympics, where it hosted two bobsleigh events. Contrary to popular belief, this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a separate run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren. It was built as a temporary, artificial track with <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice. Trial runs were undertaken in 1951 and the bobsleigh course was not used after 1952. Both Olympic events were won by Germany, with Andreas Ostler and Lorenz Nieberl participating in both winning teams. The tobogganing hill hosted the inaugural FIL World Luge Championships 1955, with Norway's Anton Salvesen winning the men's single—the only time in history Norway has won a World Luge Championships medal.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} is to show that a dense set of points on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> are {{accessible}} from the inside of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> i.e. they are {{at the end of a}} line segment lying entirely in the interior of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> In fact, a given point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is arbitrarily close to some point in the interior and there is a smallest closed disk about that point which intersects <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> only on it boundary; those boundary points are close to the original point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> and by construction are accessible.|$|R

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, {{the center}} of {{curvature}} of a curve is found at a point that is {{at a distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> equal to <b>the</b> radius of curvature lying on the normal vector. It is the point at infinity if the curvature is zero. The osculating circle to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is centered at the centre of curvature. Cauchy defined {{the center of}} curvature C as the intersection point of two infinitely close normal lines to <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> <b>The</b> locus of centers of curvature for each point on <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> comprise <b>the</b> evolute of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In geometry, an {{intrinsic}} equation of a curve is an equation that defines <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> using a relation between <b>the</b> <b>curve's</b> intrinsic properties, that is, properties {{that do not}} depend on the location and possibly the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Therefore {{an intrinsic}} equation defines the shape of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> without specifying its position relative to an arbitrarily defined coordinate system.|$|R
5|$|The LNER did {{not want}} to take full {{responsibility}} for the line, and although they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned to electrify the Chesham branch; instead, a diesel-powered GWR railcar was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the railcar performed well on <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> and slopes of the branch, the railcar had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, railcar design, {{but by the end of}} 1936, it decided instead to electrify the Chesham branch, and the railcar schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont& Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. <b>The</b> <b>curves</b> followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E

The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
