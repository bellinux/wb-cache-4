5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E

5|$|The {{scale of}} Our Friends in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. <b>The</b> <b>speaking</b> cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E
5|$|In vocal music, noisy {{nonsense}} syllables {{were used to}} imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched vocal music is <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to conduct a needs {{analysis}} to identify <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> English language communication needs of the LIDP while catering to the demands and requests of the international students. By identifying their spoken communication needs, their spoken communication skills are identified and incorporated into a proposed English language course design. Dudley-Evans and St. John‟s (1998) framework; Target Situation Analysis (TSA), Present Situation Analysis (PSA) and Learning Situation Analysis (LSA), are used in answering the two research questions. Moreover, a learning-centred course is implemented, as the learners‟ priority in acquiring the language is emphasized. This study is based on a qualitative approach which are supplemented by frequency counts from a set of questionnaire and survey checklist. The questionnaires were completed by 30 LIDP while the survey checklists were completed by 50 international students. Moreover, semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with four LIDP; the Head of the Client Services Division of the Main Library and the Head of the Library of Languages and Linguistics. Additionally, observation sessions were also conducted with four LIDP (whom were interviewed) in further verifying the derived data.

40|$|The {{varieties}} {{of the literary}} language in various spheres of human activity in the interference process are shown in the article There are two {{varieties of}} language: <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> and <b>the</b> written. <b>The</b> <b>spoken</b> language is maintained {{in the form of}} the dialogue - the written in the form of <b>the</b> monologue. <b>The</b> <b>spoken</b> language has a considerable advantage over the written, in that the human voice comes into play.
