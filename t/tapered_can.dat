40|$|Introduction: The {{treatment}} of Class I malocclusion aims to arrange teeth {{position in a}} good arch form. The arch form consists of tooth size and arch dimension (intercanine width, canine depth, intermolar width, molar depth). Numerous methods {{have been used to}} describe the arch form quantitatively. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a mathematical ratio for identifying arch form (square, oval, tapered) using arch dimension variables (intercanine width, canine depth, intermolar width, molar depth). Materials and Methods: Dental cast pre and post-orthodontic treatments from 190 Indonesian patients were scanned to obtain digital data. All data were measured using “Image Tool. ” The measured data (tooth size, intercanine width, intercanine depth, intermolar width, intermolar depth, and arch perimeter) were analyzed statistically using ordered logistic to find out determining variables to the arch form. Results: The validity, reliability, and normality of all the data were analyzed using Stata. From analyzing the data using ordered logistic, intercanine width and intermolar depth showed a reverse relation to the arch form. The shape of the arch form (square, oval, and <b>tapered)</b> <b>can</b> be described quantitatively by using ratio (CD/CW) /(MD/MW); a ratio less than 45. 30 % indicates square, 45. 30 – 53. 37 % indicates oval, and more than 53. 37 % indicates tapered. Conclusions: (CD/CW) /(MD/MW) ratio can be used to describe arch form quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of Class I malocclusion treatment is {{to arrange the}} teeth position in a good arch form. Archform consists of tooth size and arch dimension (intercanine width, canine depth, intermolar width, molardepth). Several ways are developed to describe arch form. A lot of methods usedto describe arch formqualitatively. The objectiveofthis studyistodevelop qualitative arch form diagnostic references usingartificial neural network from pre-post treatment dental cast scanning result. Pre-post orthodontictreatment dental casts (1990 - 2006) from Post Graduate Clinic Faculty of Dentistry University of Indonesiaand 3 other orthodontistswere gathered andscanned. Dataweremeasured usingImage Toolandanalyzedusing Stata 9. ANOVA {{was used to compare}} arch forms (square, oval, tapered) and gender (male andfemale), with each component of arch dimension upper and lowerjaw, before and after treatment; and alsoarch perimeter to kinds of treatmentThe results were compiled todeterminevariables inbuildingthesoftware for analyzing arch form qualitatively. The data from 190 pre-post orthodontic treatment dentalcasts consisted of 42 male (22. 1 %) and 148 female (77. 9 %) treated without extraction (32. 63 %), 4 Premolars extraction (48. 42 %), Upper Premolars extraction (11. 05 %), atypical extraction (7. 90 %). Gender and allvariables from pre treatment did not influence arch form, except kinds of treatment. Therefore, only post treatment data are included for arch form analysis. The shape of arch form (square,oval and <b>tapered)</b> <b>can</b> be described qualitatively by software using artificial neural network.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for calculating the compensating feed array complex excitations are namely, the indirect conjugate field matching (ICFM) and the direct conjugate field matching (DCFM) approach.

The DCF, in contrast calculates the array excitations by integrating directly the induced surface currents on the reflector under a receiving mode. DCFM allows the reflector to be illuminated by an incident plane wave with a tapered amplitude.

It is driven out with a wedge when a tool change is needed. Morse and Jacobs tapers are an example of the self-holding variety. With self-releasing tapers, the male will not stick in the female without a drawbar holding it there. However, with good drawbar force, it is very solidly immobile. NMTB/CAT and HSK are examples of the self-releasing variety.|$|R

40|$|The optimum wire {{shape to}} produce the minimum signal {{propagation}} delay across an RLC line is shown to exhibit a general exponential form. The line inductance makes exponential tapering more attractive for RLC lines than for RC lines. For RLC lines, optimum wire tapering achieves a greater reduction in the signal propagation delay as compared to uniform wire sizing. For RLC lines, exponential tapering outperforms uniform repeater insertion. As technology advances, wire tapering becomes more effective than repeater insertion, since a greater reduction in the propagation delay is achieved. Optimum wire tapering achieves a reduction of 36 % in the propagation delay in long RLC interconnect as compared to uniform repeater insertion. Wire <b>tapering</b> <b>can</b> reduce both the propagation delay and power dissipation. Optimum tapering for minimum propagation delay reduces the propagation delay by 15 % and power dissipation by 16 % for an example circuit. The optimum tapering factor to minimize the transient power dissipation of a circuit is described in this paper. An analytic solution to determine the optimum tapering factor that exhibits an error of less than 2 % is provided. Wire tapering is also shown to reduce the power dissipation of a circuit by up to 65 %. Wire <b>tapering</b> <b>can</b> also improve signal integrity by reducing the inductive noise of the interconnect lines. Wire tapering reduces the effect of impedance mismatch in digital circuits. The difference between the overshoots and undershoots in the signal waveform of an example clock distribution network is decreased by 34 % as compared to a uniformly sized network producing the same signal characteristics. r 2006 Elsevier B.

This paper outlines a method developed by the authors for quantifying taper material loss as well as more general taper interface parameters.

30|$|Dendrites {{with smaller}} ER need a higher RyR density to elicit a wave, {{indicating}} {{that the ability to}} trigger a calcium wave scales with the rate of calcium release from the ER. This seems to agree with [37], where wave stability is controlled by IP 3 R pump strength and, as mentioned above, by IP 3 R cluster distances. The critical threshold for wave stability decreases with increasing ER radius. Since dendrite diameters typically decrease the further they are away from the soma, ER diameters are forced to decrease as well. This would lead to a higher probability for calcium waves to become abortive. Figure  3 demonstrates how such dendritic <b>tapering</b> <b>can</b> be compensated for by an increase in RyR density.|$|R

Singular or non-singular values are each nonaccidental in that rotation in depth will not alter whether they are singular or non-singular. The difference between two contours, one with a singular {{and the other with}} a non-singular value, e. g., a straight vs. a curved contour, defines an invariant, or nonaccidental, property (NAP) difference.

This is achieved by introducing a computationally convenient class of compactly supported non-stationary covariance functions, combined with a new method for choosing spatially varying taper ranges. Numerical experiments are used to show that the performance of both kriging prediction and parameter estimation can be improved by allowing for spatially varying taper ranges. However, although adaptive tapering outperforms regular tapering, simply dividing the data into blocks and ignoring the dependence between the blocks is often a better method for parameter estimation...|$|R
