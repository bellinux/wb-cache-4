40|$|A {{fast and}} easy to {{implement}} divide-and-conquer algorithm is presented {{for the construction of}} the Constrained Delaunay triangulation of a polygonal domain. The algorithm simplifies the complicated merging step inherent to divide-and-conquer algorithms for the computation of triangulations. Furthermore, no triangles are computed outside the valid region of the domain. A grid structure accelerates the computation of the visibility among vertices with respect to the boundary polygons as well as the computation of Constrained Delaunay triangles. Introduction and previous work This algorithm was motivated by the development of an adaptive triangulation algorithm for <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surface</b> patches [Kle 94], [Ke 95].

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a variant of}} a domain decomposition method proposed by Gleicher and Kass for intersecting and <b>trimming</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Instead of using interval arithmetic to guide the decomposition, the variant described here uses affine arithmetic, a tool recently proposed for range analysis. Affine arithmetic is similar to standard interval arithmetic, but takes into account correlations between operands and sub-formulas, generally providing much tighter bounds for the computed quantities. As a consequence, the quadtree domain decompositions are much smaller and the intersection algorithm runs faster.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an incremental approach for tessellating <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A database is built {{to keep the}} tessellation of a CAD model. With the topological information provided, the database is efficiently updated when the model is modified. This enhances the tessellation process as only a slight change of the existing tessellation is required. The tessellation which involves the insertion and removal of trimlines is performed completely in the parametric space. The topological information also facilitates the triangles classification and the merging of boundaries between surfaces. The algorithm is particularly suitable for the generation of a valid triangulation of a complex CAD model for many downstream applications, e. g. in rapid prototyping (RP). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two phase technique for grid gener-ation over <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surface</b> patches that model {{components of the}} surface of a geometrically complex ob-ject like an aircraft or an automobile. In the first phase, the parametric domain of a trimmed surface patch is reparameter-ized to a computationally convenient parametric domain – a square. In the second phase, an initial surface grid generated using the new parametric domain is optimized with respect to an objective function. The objective function is non-linear and is formulated for three desirable properties – smoothness, orthogonality, and adaptivity. Simulated annealing method is used for obtaining solution to the non-linear optimization problem. The use of a simple reparameterized domain en-ables us to derive simple and efficient methods for choosing a valid initial grid and also for ensuring grid validity during the optimization phase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surface</b> {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a surface together with trimming curves lying in D, the parametric space of the surface. By investigating the interrelation between surface tessellation and trimming curve approximation, we point out some problems on trimming curve approximation in existing trimmed surface tessellation algorithms. Counter examples are presented {{to show that a}} valid approximation of trimming curves in D together with the refinement imposed by surface tessellation does not necessarily generate a valid linear approximation in 3 D space. To assure the 3 D derivation tolerance, we propose two novel step-length estimation methods such that a piecewise linear interpolant of the trimming curve based on the proposed step lengths will result in a valid linear approximation in 3 D space. The first method exploits the triangle inequality and takes the derivation tolerance in 3 D space into account to compute the effective step length. Our second method is based on segmenting the trimming curve into subcurves first and then approximates each subcurve according to the derivation tolerance in 3 D space. Moreover, several empirical tests are given to demonstrate the correctness of our step length estimations...|$|E
40|$|Many {{application}} {{areas in}} CAD/CAM {{are concerned with}} triangulation of surfaces, and require an error bounded approximation of a <b>parametric</b> <b>surface</b> model. In this paper we present {{an overview of the}} authors results on surface meshing. Two methods are described for triangulating objects bounded by <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The algorithms approximate the object with a predefined tolerance, and are adaptive to the surface curvature. The main difference between the two algorithms lies on the way that adaption is achieved. While the first method takes into account isotropic bounds of the surface curvature associated to each parametric point, the second algorithm uses bounds that do depend on the curvature direction. Emphasis is made on the computation of the curvature-based bounds and on the triangulation of the interior of the faces. Examples are presented, and results are analyzed comparing the two algorithms. Finally, open problems are enumerated. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|The {{swept volume}} of a moving solid is a {{powerful}} computational and visualization concept. It provides an excellent aid for path and accessibility planning in robotics and for simulating various manufacturing operations. It has proven difficult to evaluate the boundary of the volume swept by a solid bounded by <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces</b> undergoing an arbitrary analytic motion. Hence prior solutions use one or several of the following simplifications: (1) approximate the volume by the union of a finite set of solid instances sampled along the motion; (2) approximate the curved solid by a polyhedron, (3) approximate the motion by a sequence of simpler motions. The approach proposed here {{is based on the}} third type of simplification: it uses a polyscrew (continuous, piecewise-screw) approximation of the motion. This approach leads to a simple algorithm that generates candidate faces, computes the two-cells of their arrangement, and uses a new point-in-sweep test to select the correct cells whose union forms the boundary of the swept volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{triangulation}} of boundary representation geometries (BRep geometries) is neccessary {{for display}} generation, stereo-lithography applications and also {{finite element mesh}} (FE mesh) generation. The accuracy of the tesselation is of great significance not only for stereo-lithography and rendering algorithms but also for FE mesh generation, since even minor simplifications of the geometry of the solid can lead to large errors in the FE computation. We therefore turn our attention to a new incremental algorithm for the accurate triangulation of meshes of <b>trimmed</b> <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Instead of triangulating each face seperately, {{the faces of the}} solid are glued and triangulated together according to the neighbourhood information of the BRep. By this procedure, glueing together faces with different triangulations is avoided. Another advantage of the algorithm is that the error between the linear approximation of the boundary and the boundary itself is controlled step by step until it lies within a predefined tolerance: Because the algorithm is fully incremental, later improvements of this tolerance can be easily added. The techniques we used to produce a robust implementation of this algorithm under finite precision arithmetic are reported...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{modeling}} of complex objects {{is a difficult}} task. Free-form deformation (FFD) is {{a powerful tool for}} modeling complex objects. However, using FFD is sometimes difficult. In this thesis, FFD for <b>parametric</b> <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is presented. This method uses NURBS FFD to modify the shape of <b>parametric</b> <b>trimmed</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A feature-based FFD method is presented for 3 D Garment CAD application. Trimmed surface development is primarily used for flattening a 3 D surface into a corresponding 2 D pattern or surface. This thesis presents a general method for <b>parametric</b> <b>trimmed</b> <b>surface</b> development. This method can be applied in computer aided design, texture mapping, ship building, etc. First, the surface is triangulated and mapped onto a plane. This initial planar mapping has the same topology as its original surface. Then, a spring-mass system is applied to deform the initial planar mapping. The resulting surface elastic deformation energy distribution is indicated by a color graph, which determines a surface cutting line. The method presented in this thesis can efficiently solve development problems for complex trimmed surfaces. Accuracy of a developed surface can easily be controlled locally. Thus, compared to earlier methods, this method provides more flexibility for solving CAD and CAM surface problems. As a prior step to surface free-form deformation and surface development, an improved trimmed surface triangulation method is also presented. The algorithm first constructs triangles in parametric space, then adjusts the shapes of triangles in model space. As a result, the algorithm guarantees a good triangular mesh in model space...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{unstructured}} triangular mesh generation algorithm that approximates {{a set of}} mutually nonintersecting simple <b>trimmed</b> polynomial <b>parametric</b> <b>surface</b> patches within a user specified geometric tolerance. The proposed method uses numerically robust interval geometric representations/computations and also addresses the problem of topological consistency (homeomorphism) between the exact geometry and its approximation. Those {{are among the most}} important outstanding issues in geometry approximation problems. We also extract important differential geometric features of input geometry for use in the approximation. Our surface tessellation algorithm is based on the unstructured Delaunay mesh approach which leads to an efficient adaptive triangulation. A robust decision criterion is introduced to prevent possible failures in the conventional Delaunay triangulation. To satisfy the prescribed geometric tolerance, an adaptive node insertion algorithm is employed and furthermore, an efficient method to compute a tight upper bound of the approximation error is proposed. Unstructured triangular meshes for free-form surfaces frequently involve triangles with high aspect ratio and, accordingly, result in ill-conditioned meshing. Our proposed algorithm constructs 2 D triangulation domains which sufficiently preserve the shape of triangles when mapped into 3 D space and, furthermore, the algorithm provides an efficient method that explicitly controls the aspect ratio of the triangular elements...|$|R

40|$|Topologically {{consistent}} algorithms for {{the intersection}} and <b>trimming</b> of free-form <b>parametric</b> <b>surfaces</b> are of fundamental importance in computer-aided design, analysis, and manufacturing. Since {{the intersection of}} (for example) two bicubic tensor-product surface patches is not a rational curve, it is usually described by approximations in the parameter domain of each surface. If these approximations are employed as “trim curves”, their images in R 3 do not agree precisely, and the resulting trimmed surfaces may exhibit “gaps ” and “overlaps ” along their common edge, an artifact that often incurs failure of downstream applications. We present a direct and simple approach to the problem, wherein the intersection curve is described explicitly by the sides of a sequence of triangular Bézier patches. Instead of representing trimmed surfaces by trim curves in the surface parameter domain, together with appropriate control point perturbations to guarantee consistency, we use triangular patches to directly approximate the intersection curve and the trimmed surfaces it defines. The triangular patches are constructed so as to maintain smooth (i. e., tangent-plane continuous) connections to untrimmed patches of the original surface. We assume that the original intersecting surfaces are subject t...|$|R
