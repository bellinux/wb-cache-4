5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services. Online multiplayer includes ranked matches, where players {{battle to}} increase their rank and ascend the game's leaderboards; player matches, which do not bestow rank and offer options for quick rematches; and player lobbies, which allow up to eight players in a single room {{to compete in a}} king of the hill-style format. When an online match begins, both players can view their opponent's License Card. License Cards keep track of players' tendencies based on fighting style, record player points and total number of wins and losses, and allow players to see <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> points of their play styles. Included among the online features is Shadow Battle, a series of downloadable content packs that allow the player to fight against a team of AI-controlled opponents programmed after the techniques and preferences of Capcom's development staff and famous players from the fighting game community.|$|E

25|$|If {{the circuit}} is {{operated}} asymmetrically (as a simple supply voltage {{with just one}} positive pole), both <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> poles (or the isolated reference potential) are pulsating opposite the center (or the ground) of the input voltage analogously to <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> waveforms of the phase voltages. However, {{the differences in the}} phase voltages result in the six-pulse DC voltage (over the duration of a period). The strict separation of the transformer center from the negative pole (otherwise short-circuit currents will flow) or a possible grounding of the negative pole when powered by an isolating transformer apply correspondingly to the symmetrical operation.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> {{electrodes}} (or simply positrode and negatrode, respectively) of symmetric supercapacitors {{consist of}} the same material, theoretically supercapacitors have no true polarity and catastrophic failure does not normally occur.

Asymmetric supercapacitors are inherently polar.|$|E

Therefore to properly answer the query, the recipient must select {{the positive or negative}} version and use it in the formation of their response.|$|E

25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E
25|$|The {{women of}} Nicaragua prior to, {{during and after}} the {{revolution}} played a prominent role within the nation's society as they have commonly been recognized, throughout history and across all Latin American states, as its backbone. Nicaraguan women were therefore directly affected by all of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> events that took place during this revolutionary period. The victory of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1979 brought about major changes and gains for women, mainly in legislation, broad educational opportunities, training programs for working women, childcare programs to help women enter the work force and greatly increased participation and leadership positions in a range of political activities. This, in turn, reduced the burdens that the women of Nicaragua were faced with prior to the revolution. During the Sandinista government, women were more active politically. The large majority of members of the neighborhood committees (Comités de Defensa Sandinista) were women. By 1987, 31% of the executive positions in the Sandinista government, 27% of the leadership positions of the FSLN, and 25% of the FSLN's active membership were women.|$|E
