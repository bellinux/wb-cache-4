In this paper we will give two methods to generalize this construction for polynomials of any degree d, i. e. we will design two Zero-Knowledge schemes ZK(d) and ˜ ZK(d) from a set of polynomial equations of degree d. We will show that ˜ ZK(d) is optimal in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> computations to be performed and that ZK(d) is optimal in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bits to be send.
