Petrol prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre, which is far from <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>price</b> of approx. $0.90 per litre.

5|$|To {{address this}} concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost. Working with General Atomics, the LIFE team developed a concept using on-site fuel factories that would mass-produce pellets {{at a rate of about}} a million a day. It was expected that this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>price</b> was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E

50|$|In a cash merger, the {{acquirer}} {{offers to}} purchase the shares of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> for a certain <b>price</b> in cash. <b>The</b> <b>target’s</b> stock <b>price</b> will most likely increase when the acquirer makes the offer, but the stock price will remain below the offer value. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>target's</b> stock <b>price</b> will increase to a level above the offer price. This would indicate that investors expect that a higher bid could be coming for <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> either from <b>the</b> acquirer or from a third party. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy <b>the</b> <b>target's</b> stock. <b>The</b> arbitrageur makes a profit when <b>the</b> <b>target's</b> stock <b>price</b> approaches <b>the</b> offer price, which will occur when the likelihood of deal consummation increases. <b>The</b> <b>target's</b> stock <b>price</b> will be equal to the offer price upon deal completion.|$|R

500|$|MITS was now $300,000 in {{debt and}} Roberts {{was looking for a}} new hit product. He decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer.

Intel had just released the 8080, their first microprocessor that could be a general purpose computer. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>price</b> of this complete computer kit had to be under $400. To meet this price, Roberts agreed to order 1000 microprocessors from Intel for $75 each. Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, began designing the computer.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{research}} to examine the determinants of the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> of sell-side analysts within a relative context. This is achieved by utilising a within analyst rank-correlation of <b>target</b> <b>price</b> expected returns and realised price returns, which measures whether analysts can accurately rank the price appreciation of stocks within their coverage cluster. The study then investigates whether the factors that determine the absolute accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> also explain <b>the</b> relative accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices.</b> <b>The</b> evidence suggests {{that many of the}} determinants of the absolute accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> are not necessarily determinants of the relative accuracy of <b>target</b> <b>prices,</b> providing a more nuanced understanding of their association with analyst forecasts. This thesis is also the first research to examine discordance between analysts’ recommendations and <b>target</b> <b>price</b> expected returns at an individual analyst level, documenting similar discordance to that found in prior research at a consensus level...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} value of delegating <b>price</b> level <b>targets</b> to a {{discretionary}} central bank in an economy with nominal frictions in both labor and product markets. In contrast to recent studies that demonstrate <b>the</b> benefits of <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of output, model simulations provide evidence that favors <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of labor, or the nominal wage, instead.

By <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> level, the monetary authority can generate temporarily expected inflation when nominal rates are zero, pushing real rates down.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{assumptions}} of infinite-horizon forecasting {{in the field of}} firm valuation.

It is argued that the equivalence between cash accounting and accrual accounting is the way of verifying such steady-state assumption. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an accuracy index measuring the variance of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>prices</b> due to variations in long-term assumptions. The efficacy of this index is validated by using Logit and Cox regression models on a sample of 784 equity reports on European companies published by sell-side analysts.
