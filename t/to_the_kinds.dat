25|$|There is a {{widespread}} stereotype of gay male speech, but not of lesbian speech.

As such, the study of lesbian speech has been neglected, and linguists who are interested in the topic often have difficulty figuring out where to even begin their research.|$|E

The ragas are grouped into sets of six, called chakras ("wheels", though actually segments in the conventional representation) grouped according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees. There is a system known as the katapayadi sankhya to determine the names of melakarta ragas.|$|E

For example, he learned the importance of the structural rigidity that double bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{production}} from phytoplankton {{is a function}} of two different factors: growth rates and accumulation (Fig. 1). Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, phytoplankton production rates are quite low. Nitrate is optimally used by phytoplankton for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient limited, phytoplankton tend to grow more slowly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of nitrogen present. Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column. This limits phytoplankton photosynthesis to a relatively shallow photic zone. Thus, when the water column is stratified, turbidity is high, and ammonium is present, the growth rate of phytoplankton is typically suppressed.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

Since individuals with FH underlying body biochemistry is slightly different, their high cholesterol levels are less responsive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH (such as dietary modification and statin tablets).

500|$|The eleven {{numbered}} circuit {{courts of}} appeals and the District of Columbia Circuit have appellate jurisdiction over cases {{in almost every}} area of the law arising {{within the boundaries of}} that circuit. However, the subjects that appear more frequently in each circuit vary according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of cases that arise more often within the circuit's boundaries. The District of Columbia Circuit, for example, hears a large number of administrative law cases. Likewise, the Second Circuit hears nearly one third of all federal securities law appeals, and the Fifth Circuit hears approximately one half of all federal immigration appeals. Eric Hansford argues that this has led to [...] "specialized" [...] courts with particular expertise with the subjects that appear before the court more frequently. Studies also suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm decisions of circuit courts when the circuit court has ruled on a case for which they possess special expertise.|$|E
500|$|Other {{methods of}} {{organization}} exist, often {{in an attempt}} to address the shortcomings of the radical method, but are less common. [...] For instance, it is common for a dictionary ordered principally by the Kangxi radicals to have an auxiliary index by pronunciation, expressed typically in either hanyu pinyin or zhuyin fuhao. [...] This index points to the page in the main dictionary where the desired character can be found. [...] Other methods use only the structure of the characters, such as the four-corner method, in which characters are indexed according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of strokes located nearest the four corners (hence the name of the method), or the Cangjie method, in which characters are broken down into a set of 24 basic components. [...] Neither the four-corner method nor the Cangjie method requires the user to identify the proper radical, although many strokes or components have alternate forms, which must be memorized in order to use these methods effectively.|$|E

Words always refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of things they were coined to refer to, thus {{the kinds of things}} their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E
2500|$|Among Buddhists {{there is}} a wide {{diversity}} of opinion about homosexuality.

2500|$|In modern times, {{there are}} fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues, {{anthropology}} has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example God in Buddhism, Jain cosmology, or non-theistic animism). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, {{at least in some}} regions? [...] According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.|$|E

In Paul Aretzu's view, {{the manner in}} which such developments are presented constitutes [...] "a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination."

The latter episode is praised by Ştefănescu for its [...] "irresistible" [...] black humor and its [...] "devilish verve". The same commentator states: [...] "The novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader. After you finish reading this novel about the ugliness of (literary) life , you feel, paradoxically, the joy of living, of communicating, of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being." [...] In Artezu's account, those parts of Căderea Bastiliei in which Gârbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a [...] "captivating" [...] humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an [...] "innocent cynicism, characteristic for the author".
