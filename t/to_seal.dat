5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores.

This patented varnish that Myers invented was able <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

50|$|Although the LDS Church has {{abandoned}} {{the practice of}} plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy.

5|$|The coup {{caught the}} Ngô family {{completely}} off-guard, {{but was also}} chaotically executed. The plotters neglected <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> the roads leading into the capital Saigon <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> off loyalist reinforcements, and they hesitated after gaining the initiative. After initially being trapped inside the Independence Palace, Diệm stalled the coup by holding negotiations and promising reforms, such as the inclusion of military officers in the administration. In the meantime, opposition politicians joined the fray, trying to exploit Diệm's position. However, the president's real aim was to buy time for loyalist forces to enter the capital and relieve him. The coup failed when the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN entered Saigon and defeated the rebels. More than four hundred people—many of whom were civilian spectators—were killed in the ensuing battle. These included a group of anti-Diệm civilians who charged across the palace walls at Thi's urging and were cut down by loyalist gunfire.|$|E
