5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E
