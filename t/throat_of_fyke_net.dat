40|$|Study {{on fishing}} {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> {{was conducted at}} reef waters at {{the west coast of}} Selayar Island from November 2008 to October 2010. The main objective of this research is to determine the best design and technical operation for environmental friendly catching <b>of</b> reef fish. <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> is chosen as an experimental fishing gear because its shape is a combination between basket trapnet ???bubu???, traditional fishing gear which is cosidered as environmental friendly fishing gear for catching coral reef fish and fence setnet (sero) shape. The first design <b>of</b> the experimantal <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> follows the original shape, support with 5 rectangular steel frames and surrounding by 0. 75 inch of webbing 5 m in length, 1. 8 m in width and 1. 2 m in height. It has two 2 m fixed and 15 m flexible extended wings. Unlike ???bubu???, <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> has not use bait for attracting the fish, therefore the entrance <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> should be large enough to make the fish entering freely. In two months <b>of</b> operations the <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> did not show satisfactory results because the fish moved back and forward through the entrance <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> easily and the main problem was bycatch of turtels, therefore the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was designed. The new feature <b>of</b> the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was playground with rectangular vertical opening. The size of the opening was 150 x 15 cm devided into seven small entrances {{in order to protect the}} turtles entering the gear. To keep the fish inside the playground some 40 cm cableties are tied at the frame of the entrance functioning as shieves. In two months of operations the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was show better results however the new problem was the weight of the gear became heavier because of the increase of diameter of steelframe used, therefore, the third <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was designed to find a lighter gear. The third <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was supported by a rectangular polyvinil chloride (PVC) tube frames combined by polyethylene ropes, covered by 1. 25 inch of webbing. No more turtles was caught but more life reef fish was caught. To evaluate which design and methods of operation was better, three types <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and two methods of operations were examined. RAPFISH (Rapid Appraisal of Fish Status) is used to analyze which type <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> is the most suitable for reef fishing and to analyze the status <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> as an environmental friendly fishing gear. RAPFISH applies a statistical ordination technique called multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Based on this analysis the third <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> lighter gear with PVC tube frames, shows the best value for it performance and technical operations, and <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> is an environmental friendly fishing gear (value > 50. 0 in the range of 0 - 100). Ecological aspects gave the highest value for the status <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> as an environmental friendly fishing gear followed by ethical, technological, social and economical aspects...|$|R

40|$|Recent and {{increasing}} interest in tempo- rary ponds as biodiversity reservoirs fosters our need to test sampling techniques for characterising their biological communities. We compared {{the efficiency of}} dip-netting to that <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> in sampling the macroinvertebrate assemblage of a temporary pond in Don˜ ana National Park (SW Spain). We sampled the pond at four different times—morning, afternoon, evening and night—distinguishing between deep and shallow zones. In our sampling, dip-netting captured a higher number of taxa, and higher abundances <b>of</b> individuals than <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> However, both techniques captured exclusive taxa, not recorded with the other device. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> distinguished between nocturnal and diurnal macroinvertebrates, and hence are more appropriate to study macroinvertebrate diel activity. We detected nocturnal activity in Gerris thoracicus larvae, and adults of Colymbetes fuscus, Rhantus suturalis, Rhantus hispanicus and Hydrochara flav- ipes. Conversely, larvae of Sympetrum fonscolombei and Notonecta spp., and adults of Notonecta glauca were mainly diurnal. The overall diel activity pattern of the macroinvertebrate assemblage depended on the diel activities of their integrating taxa and stages. Although dip-netting was more appropriate to sample macroinvertebrate assemblages in different micro- habitats, <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> better captured nocturnal and fast- swimming invertebrates. Consequently, the joint use of both sampling techniques would capture a better picture of the representative macrofauna of a tempo- rary pond than either one on its ownPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Mark-recapture studies {{indicated}} that a pulsed-DC electrical barrier set to a 2 -ms pulse width and 10 pulses/s completely blocked the spawning migration of sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus in the Jordan River, Michigan. Capture efficiency <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> averaged 24 % for four groups, about 300 tagged sea lampreys each, released upstream of the barrier; no unmarked sea lampreys {{and none of the}} 1, 194 sea lampreys tagged and released downstream of the barrier were captured in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> while the barrier was energized. At a lower pulsator setting (1 -ms pulse width, 10 pulses/s), 1 of 900 sea lampreys released below the barrier was recaptured in the nets. Sea lampreys from downstream were captured in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> after the barrier was de-energized, indicating that the barrier should remain in operation later than mid-July. Both sea lampreys and teleosts exposed to the electrical field were stunned but exhibited no apparent damage at either barrier setting. The pulsed DC electrical barrier should help reduce the use of chemical lampricides for controlling sea lampreys in some Great Lakes streams and would be particularly suited for streams where even the smallest low-head barrier would create an unacceptably large impoundment...|$|R

40|$|Sampling and {{assessment}} of nearshore fish communities is difficult due to {{the wide variety of}} habitats, substrates, and often complex structures. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, we conducted a comparison of ten different gear types, with the intent to develop a long-term sampling protocol of nearshore communities in Oneida Lake, NY. Gear types consisted of nine configurations <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and one seine. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> varied by frame size (large vs. small), mesh size (large vs. small), orientation (parallel vs. perpendicular), and the inclusion/exclusion of wings. Summers were broken into two sampling periods, during which 2 different sites were chosen for each of three major substrate types (sandy, rocky, and muddy) for a total of six sites. Student?s t-test indicated significantly higher species richness and total catch during sampling period two. However, few significant differences were observed in any net-to-net comparisons using Tukey?s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Catches of key sport fishes, such as smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were significantly higher in smaller meshed nets. In order to maximize ease, efficiency and accuracy, we recommend assessments of nearshore communities take place in sampling period two, using a combination of perpendicularly set medium frame <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> with both large and small mesh sizes. Additional species, not caught by <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> can be supplemented by seining at all sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{littoral}} zone of small off-stream water storage containing a translocated population of Galaxias auratus was sampled fortnightly at {{day and night}} with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> electrofishing and snorkelling over 3 months. Variation in population data provided by each method, including relative abundance indices, size structure, and habitat preferences, were examined. Aspects of behaviour and activity patterns were also investigated. Night sampling using all methods consistently yielded larger catches than day sampling. The size structure of catches varied, with electrofishing at night and <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> during the day having higher proportions of juveniles, whilst snorkelling at night and electrofishing during the day had higher proportions <b>of</b> adults. <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> at night yielded {{by far the largest}} catches (3 -fold more than other methods) and also captured balanced proportions of juveniles and adults. Galaxias auratus had a strong diel activity pattern and were most active at night. The majority of the population migrated into the {{littoral zone}} during the night and back into deeper water during the day. A small number of juveniles remained in the littoral zone and some adults sheltered in the dense cover of species-rich littoral vegetation during the day. Shores with shallow depth profiles appeared to be preferred due to higher catches in these areas using all methods. Based on the results <b>of</b> this study, <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> at night in littoral habitats is recommended for monitoring populations <b>of</b> G. auratus. <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> is likely to be an effective method for monitoring other lacustrine galaxiid species; however, further work is required to investigate the effects of habitat variables and fish community structure on activity patterns of galaxiids, and hence their catchability with various methods, in more extensive lentic environments...|$|R
40|$|Although many goby {{species have}} become widely {{established}} {{outside of their}} native ranges, little is known yet about invasive population biology. The age, growth and population dynamics of two introduced goby species (Rhinogobius giurinus and Rhinogobius cliffordpopei) were quantified in Lake Erhai (southwest China) with the general aim to improve empirical knowledge and management strategies. The results revealed that their lifespan ranges 2 years. The size and time at sexual maturity for R. cliffordpopei was lower than for R. giurinus. R. cliffordpopei displayed higher total mortality, fishing mortality and exploitation rates than R. giurinus, whereas the natural mortality of R. cliffordpopei was {{lower than that of}} R. giurinus. The catch per unit effort <b>of</b> benthic <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> was low from April to June in R. cliffordpopei and from July to September in R. giurinus, whereas it was high from July to September in R. cliffordpopei and from April to June in R. giurinus. Thus, several specific strategies are suggested to improve the cost-efficiency of the current management practices related to the mesh size <b>of</b> benthic <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> used for physical removals, the timing of deployment of control actions and the use of synergic control methods...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991, we have {{systematically}} {{recorded the}} fish and crab fauna of the Schelde estuary in samples of power plants cooling water and <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> In this period, we found 71 species of which eight were introduced (table 1). Additionally, one native and three non indigenous crab speices were observed. All non native marine species recorded in the estuary arrived from North America. Probably, their presence is due to transport via the ballast water of ships docking {{at the port of}} Antwerp. All non native freshwater species in the estuary arrived from eastern Europe and Asia. The occurrence of these species in the estuary is almost invariably due to deliberate introductions. The most recent observations of non-indigenous species in the Schelde estuary date from October 2001 when two young Vimba vimba and an adult Micropogonias undulatus were caught nearby the Dutch-Belgian border (Stevens et al., submitted).

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} environmental monitoring {{such as the}} impact on the environment and the financial costs are problems we face when trying to conserve freshwater systems around the world. The need for precise and accurate results that are cost effective is important so that we can achieve our conservation goals. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} explore Next-Generation - metabarcoding for the detection of feral and native freshwater fish species based on the DNA shed by individual organisms into the water column. Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) primers were developed for this study using DNA from six freshwater species expected to be found in the waterbody. These primers, along with 16 S rRNA (16 S) primers, were assessed to ensure that the molecular method was robust and suitable for use in the field. Along with the cost effectiveness of the molecular method when compared to the more traditional surveying method <b>of</b> <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying. This study comprised development of field and lab protocols for the detection of freshwater fish species in a lentic system. Both the COI and 16 S primer sets showed results that were comparable to previous <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveys, though both primer sets detected species that the other did not. Further qPCR analysis showed that there were differences in detection for both primers for each of the species. The molecular surveying of the waterbody has been proven sensitive enough to detect Maccullochella peelii. This species has a very low abundance in the waterbody (believed to be n= 1) so these results suggest that this method can be used to target low abundance species. The outcome of this study highlighted the need for multi-location sampling within a waterbody as increasing the number of locations sampled, led to an increase in the number of species detected. Along with the multi-location sampling, it was also important to sample throughout the year to account for seasonal variability. The eDNA study emphasized the importance of having knowledge of both the ecology and the biology of the species targeted so that a robust monitoring method can be implemented. As well as comparing the apparent accuracy <b>of</b> <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> and the eDNA approach in the study waterbody, a cost benefit analysis comparing the relative costs of multiplex DNA surveying, single species molecular surveying, and <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying was undertaken. Molecular environmental surveying was found to be a cost effective method for monitoring, as the analysis suggested single species monitoring would break even after only 95 waterbodies were surveyed, and multiplex surveying would break even after 145 waterbodies, under the proposed scenario. The cost benefit analysis explored the costs associated with all three methods, including lab set up costs, along with the number of waterbodies that could be surveyed on both a weekly and yearly basis...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} two hundred years many {{wetlands}} and streams in Sweden have been lowered to provide land for agriculture and forestry. Some of the coastal wetlands and streams probably served as spawning sites for certain species of fish in the Baltic Sea, but the present situation is not well known. As standardized methods to monitor fish in running waters are carried out during late summer or autumn, {{there is a need}} for methods to sample spring-spawning fish in these streams. The aim of this study was to survey the lower kilometer stretch of Hammerstaån in Stockholm, to investigate the extent to which the stream is used by spring-spawning fish. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate a new type of survey fishing gill net called strömöversiktsnät (SÖN). This was done by comparing the catch of fish by SÖN with that <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> The comparison <b>of</b> the types of gear included number of fish caught, on a catch per unit effort (CPUE) basis, number of species and the size distributions. The study included 14 days with one gill <b>net</b> and one <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> at two sites, in total 28 net-days. The inventory yielded in total seventeen species among which only trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), burbot (Lota lota), eel (Anguilla anguilla) and pike (Esox lucius) were previously known to occur. Six spawning species, smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), vimba bream (Vimba vimba), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama) and white bream (Blicka bjoerkna) were caught in more than 60 individuals, which was set as a limit for comparisons of size distributions.

40|$|In {{the salt}} marshes {{different}} habitats {{as well as}} the environmental parameters influence the composition of the nekton community. Considering both the environmental parameters and the different habitats, our sampling campaign occurred in five marshes along the River Schelde (Grembergen, Saeftinghe, Waarde, Zuidgors and Zwin). The salinity gradient differed from 0. 2 till 29 psu. Sampling campaign occurred from April until October in 2000. Three different sampling techniques were used adapting to the different habitats. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> were set in the big creeks.

We used plastic minnow traps (PM), metal minnow traps (MM) and two types <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> differing in mesh size (F 1, small meshed; F 2, large meshed) to capture over 12, 000 fish belonging to 11 species. Over 97 % of captured fish were Andalusian toothcarp (Aphanius baeticus), Iberian loach (Cobitis paludica) and sand smelt (Atherina boyeri). F 1 was the most efficient trap type in capturing the three most abundant species. Catches by PM and F 2 differed in taxonomic composition, the former being characterised by toothcarp and loach dominance and the latter by the catch of eel (Anguilla anguilla) and grey mullets (Fam. Mugilidae). There were large differences {{in the size of}} fish captured in each trap type, with fish size following the pattern F 2 > MM > F 1 > PM. Small juveniles of the three dominant species were captured only in PM, thus enabling us to follow their seasonal size variation. However, PM traps were inefficient for sand smelt sampling and failed to catch large individuals of this species. This schooling and mainly pelagic species was more accurately monitored through the use of F 1.

Time-series of {{the species}} caught in a complex <b>of</b> four <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> that were {{monitored}} and recorded {{by a team of}} volunteer fishers provided the basis for identifying trends in the changes of fish assemblages during the 1995 - 2006 period.

In the summer season, juvenile pikeperch, Sander lucioperca (L.) and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus (L.), were dominant in number. The relative abundance of eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.) exhibited a clearly decreasing trend due to fishery exploitation and the lack of stocking. The decreased share of the largest pikeperch individuals suggested that this species is being overexploited. Ruffe exhibited a strong decline more probably due to strong impact from numerous black cormorants.

40|$|Intertidal {{migration}} is relatively well-studied in marine fish biology. Most studies focused on marine sandy beaches and rocky shores. Comparatively little work, however, {{has been done}} on the distribution and migration patterns of fishes on estuarine mudflats. The seasonal composition of an intertidal estuarine fish community was studied with directional <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> at different heights on the mudflat. These <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> each sampled an opposite direction and as such could be used to analyze the migration patterns of fishes on the mudflat. The fish assemblage was dominated by juveniles of Clupea harengus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Platichthys flesus and Solea solea. The composition of the intertidal fish community reflected the cyclicity of seasonal recruitment of species into the estuary. Analysis of the directional data <b>of</b> the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> showed that the flatfish species, flounder and sole, migrated actively onto the mudflat. In contrast, the distribution of herring and seabass in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> suggests that they were transported passively by the tidal currents. These (semi-) pelagic species can be considered opportunistic vagrants onto the mudflat. They might follow their migrating hyperbenthic and pelagic prey and may find a valuable supplement to their diet in the infauna that disperses into the water column. Because of the low predator abundance and high turbidity {{in this part of the}} Scheldt estuary, predation is probably not an important trigger for intertidal migration. Species didn’t show a clear zonation on the mudflat and, if observed, this was mainly the result of species-specific differences in mobility. The zonation of flatfishes tended to be affected by density-dependent processes. Whenfish densities were higher, relatively more flounder were caught on the upper shore. By doing so, they avoid competition for food or space with sole, which stays on the middle and lower reaches of the mudflat...|$|R
40|$|The ichthyofauna of the River Minho tidal {{freshwater}} wetlands (TFWs) was {{studied in}} a semienclosed area, between June 2007 and May 2010, to determine temporal patterns of abundance, biomass and species composition. Fish catches, standardized {{by the number}} <b>of</b> <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and by the fishing effort, were analysed and related to river flow, water temperature and precipitation. In total, 21 fish species were identified including six non-indigenous species (NIS) which represented 15 % of the total captures (yet 43 % of the biomass). Regarding ecological guilds, 82 % were freshwater species (61 % of the biomass) which included all NIS, whereas 13 % of the catches were catadromous species (31 % biomass) corresponding to eels. Only 4 % were estuarine species (1 % biomass) and together marine estuarine opportunists and anadromous species accomplished 1 % (2 and 6 % biomass, respectively). The fish assemblage showed seasonal patterns with {{a clear distinction between}} autumn/winter and spring/summer periods. Significant differences in abundance and biomass were also detected between autumn/winter of 2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009, i. e., inter-annual variations, with the latter period with lower catches yet higher dominance of NIS. Besides, higher water temperature had a significant negative effect on the observed number of species, but a positive effect on the abundance and biomass of NIS.

Trachemys scripta was diurnal; however, its activity was concentrated in the morning hours. Apalone spinifera was diurnal as well, with most activity {{in the afternoon and}} very little in the morning. Emydoidea blandingii was rarely captured, and all captures were made during daytime hours. Activity patterns did not change substantially between two sampling periods from mid-May to mid-June and from late-July to early-August. These activity patterns are consistent with differences in the frequency of basking: baskers are diurnal (e. g., C. picta, G. geographica, T. scripta, E. blandingii and A. spinifera), whereas those that are secretive are crepuscular (e. g., S. odoratus and C. serpentina) ...|$|R
40|$|One of the world’s most {{successful}} marine invaders, the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), continues to spread and invade the coastlines of Atlantic Canada. In Prince Edward Island in particular, populations {{have continued to}} expand since the late 1990 s. In areas like these, there is a distinct need to document this species’ expansion into new habitats, to monitor its impacts on important native species, and to develop innovative mitigation strategies to control some of its effects. This thesis addressed the large information gap that still exists on this species’ effect in the Atlantic Canadian region by focusing on four main areas: First, I explored over a decade of green crab population expansion records along Prince Edward Island’s main shorelines. Second, I surveyed and {{examined the effects of}} green crabs on vulnerable size classes of an important shellfish species, the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Third, I performed a preliminary study into the occurrence and synchrony of molting in green crabs, identifying suitable physical features of pre-molting crabs as a first step for developing a soft-shell crab industry. And fourth, I developed and tested a novel bycatch reduction device to be used with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> to facilitate the implementation of the aforementioned directed fishery for this species. Samples collected during the years 2000 - 2013 indicated that green crab expansion rates on Prince Edward Island vary spatially and temporarily. Expansion rates were higher along the south shore than the north shore of the island, and it was hypothesized that this dissimilarity was possibly related to the higher availability of suitable habitat along the south shore. The speed of the spread was such that it seemed more likely related to the benthic movement of juvenile and adult crabs than associated to larval spread or new anthropogenic vectors. With regards to green crab impacts, multiple oyster bed surveys conducted in 2014 measured mortality levels of vulnerable size classes of oysters. These surveys revealed that the probability of mortality of small oysters was higher in areas where green crabs were present. This probability decreased in the presence of other food sources (i. e. mussel beds), a result likely linked to green crab prey preferences. Field experiments using inclusion/exclusion cages indicated that the odds of oyster mortality was higher in inclusion cages than in the open environment and exclusion cages. These results suggested {{that at least some of}} the mortality of oysters could be attributed to green crab predation. With the recent implementation of a fishery for green crab as a potential mitigation strategy, there is a need for a marketable product to prompt fishermen to harvest green crabs. A soft-shell green crab product modelled after the Venetian “moleche” is expected to provide a lucrative incentive beyond the existing hard shell bait market. The examination of the timing and characteristics of molting revealed that synchronized “molting windows” or times of increased molting occur in the early summer for male green crabs. Recorded molting rates in the laboratory and the field were as high as 75 % and 60 %, respectively. External physical characteristics such as the presence of a “halo” on the episternites of the carapace, were deemed a reliable indicator that a crab would molt within 3 weeks. Although these results were preliminary in nature, they were promising and suggested that further studies be performed on the potential scaling up <b>of</b> these results. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> are a natural choice for a directed fishery of green crabs, as this type of gear is readily available and used locally, primarily for American eel (Anguilla rostrata). These nets are also a variant <b>of</b> the <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> used in Italy to fish for a similar species of crab (Carcinus aestuarii) during its molting season. However, before <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> can be used in a directed fishery for green crab in Atlantic Canada, bycatch must be reduced. A novel Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) for <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> was therefore developed and evaluated. Bycatch numbers and diversity, including three key commercial species, were significantly lower in the BRD equipped nets. Overall, the results of this thesis advance green crab research in the region, especially with regards to the quantification of impacts and development of mitigation measures. Further research questions as a result of my thesis work are identified and briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} small-mesh (4 -mm) <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> {{and boat}} electrofishing for sampling a littoral fish assemblage in Muskegon Lake, Michigan. We hypothesized that <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> selects for small-bodied fishes and electrofishing selects for large-bodied fishes. Three sites were sampled during May (2004 and 2005), July (2005 only), and September (2004 and 2005). We {{found that the}} species composition of captured fish differed considerably between <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> and electrofishing based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Species strongly associated with <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> (based on NMDS and relative abundance) included the brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, mimic shiner Notropis volucellus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, whereas species associated with electrofishing included the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, catostomids (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, walleye Sander vitreus, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio. The total length of fish captured by electrofishing was 12. 8 cm (95 % confidence interval ¼ 5. 5 – 17. 2 cm) {{greater than that of}} fish captured by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting.</b> Size selectivity <b>of</b> the gears contributed to differences in species composition of the fish captured, supporting our initial hypothesis. Thus, small-mesh <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and boat electrofishers provided complementary information on a littoral fish assemblage.

40|$|Fishes {{belonging}} to the family Galaxiidae are relatively small (usually < 300 mm long), freshwaterdwelling teleosts that are found on several land masses in the southern hemisphere (McDowall & Fulton 1996). Many galaxiid species have nondiadromous life histories {{and the distribution of}} some of these consists of discrete lacustrine populations (McDowall 2000; Allen, Midgley & Allen 2002). As a result of restricted or fragmented distributions, along with other impacts (e. g. introduced fish species), many lacustrine galaxiid species are considered to be threatened; hence monitoring populations for conservation purposes is a common management practice. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> are known to be effective for capturing small-sized benthic or littoral fish in lakes (Fago 1998; Krueger & Hubert 1998), including galaxiids (Rowe & Chisnall 1997; Rowe, Konui & Christie 2002). <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> catches <b>of</b> Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in lakes vary seasonally, suggesting relative abundance indices based on catch data often require correction for differences in catchability (Ryan 1984). Seasonal fluctuations in <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> catches <b>of</b> European perch, Perca fluviatilis L., due to spawning-related habitat shifts were also reported by Kubeka (1992). Other studies showed that cover-orientated fish species tend to have increased catchability by <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> because <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> provide cover (Krueger & Hubert 1998; Rogers, Hansen & Beard 2003) ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{methods to}} reduce the {{incidental}} catch of non-target species is important, as by-catch mortality poses threats especially to large aquatic predators. We examined {{the effectiveness of a}} novel device, a "seal sock", in mitigating the by-catch mortality of seals in coastal <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> fisheries in the Baltic Sea. The seal sock developed and tested in this study was a cylindrical net attached to the <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> allowing the seals access to the surface to breathe while trapped inside fishing gear. The number of dead and live seals caught in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> without a seal sock (years 2008 - 2010) and with a sock (years 2011 - 2013) was recorded. The seals caught in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> were mainly juveniles. Of ringed seals (Phoca hispida botnica) both sexes were equally represented, while of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) the ratio was biased (71 %) towards males. All the by-caught seals were dead in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> without a seal sock, whereas 70 % of ringed seals and 11 % of grey seals survived when the seal sock was used. The seal sock proved to be effective in reducing the by-catch mortality of ringed seals, but did not perform as well with grey seals. 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{conflicts}} between seals and fisheries along the Swedish west coast have intensified {{during the last}} decades, concurrently {{with the increase in}} the harbour seal population size. This study presents published information about interactions between harbour seals and fisheries in the Kattegat-Skagerrak, in addition to new information on the seal by-catch rate and an overview of fisheries suffering from seal damage. Several fisheries have reported interactions with seals, principally fisheries with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets and static gear. Development of mitigation measures has been focused on the eel fishery with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> in which the use of stronger net material has significantly decreased the damage frequency from seals and has yet maintained the catches at satisfactory levels. Under-water filming at <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> together with studies of the prey preferences of seals has shown individual specializations in certain foraging techniques. For example, eel may not be a common prey for harbour seals in general, but, it was chosen in preference to other species by seals attacking <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> There is a lack of current data concerning the diet of harbour seals. Previous studies, based on material from the 1970 s and 1980 s, have shown that locally and seasonally abundant prey is preferred. Due to the non-existent information about the food choice, current assessments of the ecological role of harbour seals in Sweden cannot be evaluated. </div...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Bycatch of turtles in passive inland <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> {{fisheries}} {{has been}} poorly studied, yet bycatch {{is an important}} conservation issue given the decline in many freshwater turtle populations. Delayed maturity and low natural adult mortality make turtles particularly susceptible to population declines when faced with additional anthro-pogenic adult mortality such as bycatch. When turtles are captured in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> the prolonged submergence can lead to stress and subsequent drowning. Fish die within infre-quently checked passive fishing nets and dead fish are a potential food source for many freshwater turtles. Dead fish could thus act as attractants and increase turtle captures in fishing nets. We investigated the attraction of turtles to decomposing fish within <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> in eastern Ontario. We set <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> with either 1 kg of one-day or five-day decomposed fish, or no decomposed fish in the cod-end of the net. Decomposing fish did not alter the capture rate of turtles or fish, nor did it alter the species composition of the catch. Thus, reducing fish mortality in nets using shorter soak times is unlikely to alter turtle bycatch rates since turtles were not attracted by the dead fish. Interestingly, turtle bycatch rates increased as water temperatures did. Water temperature also influences turtle mortality by affecting the duration turtles can remain submerged. We thus suggest that submerged nets to either not be set or have reduced soak times in warm water conditions (e. g., [20 C) as turtles tend to be captured more frequently and cannot withstand prolonged submergence...|$|R

40|$|Kangaroo Lake is {{the largest}} lake in Door County and has a surface area of 1, 123 acres. The lake has a maximum depth of 12 feet and an average depth of 6 feet. Kangaroo Lake has a Trophic State Index (TSI) rating of {{eutrophic}} indicating nutrient rich, productive water. At times, because the lake is shallow, lake water can be very turbid due to wind action or from heavy boating use. Because of concerns about the perceived decline in the fishery of Kangaroo Lake, a comprehensive fish survey was conducted in 2004 to evaluate the fish populations of the lake. The survey began in April and continued through October. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> were set on Kangaroo Lake shortly following ice-out and ran from April 6 through April 20.
