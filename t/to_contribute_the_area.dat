[URL] artigo visa contribuir para a área dos Estudos da Tradução com uma breve análise de aspectos contextuais de três pseudotraduções de Giacomo Leopardi (1798 - 1837). O escritor de Recanati realiza traduções de autores clássicos e também modernos desde jovem, e esse processo abre seu horizonte para sua formação, amadurecimento e criação literária. As pseudotraduções estão diretamente ligadas a esse processo, visto que Leopardi se utiliza dessa técnica para lançar sua obra e tornar-se conhecido e reconhecido no cenário literário de sua época.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{architectural style}} {{to appear in}} the district is the Italianate, as typified in the house at 35 Chestnut, built about 1860, and a trio of houses at 9, 11, and 13 Cedar, built about 1870. Probably the finest example of the style in the district is the Charles Wood House at 34 Chestnut. The best example of Second Empire architecture is the c. 1870 Lorenzo D. Hawkins House at 1 Cedar. Stick style and Queen Anne houses are probably the most numerous in the district, with particularly fine examples in the Sidney A. Hill House, Newton Lamson House, and the Franklin B.

Two ways of material transport appear <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>area</b> loss: in <b>the</b> vapor phase and at {{the surface of the}} oxide. The related rate-determining steps are attributed to the formation of the volatile compound Ti(OH) 2 Cl 2 in the first case, and to the diffusion of hydroxyl ions in the second one. At high partial pressure of water, the rate is enhanced by surface interactions between water molecules and chlorine-containing species...|$|R
