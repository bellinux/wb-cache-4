5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and <b>their</b> <b>business,</b> elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin.

5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for <b>their</b> <b>business</b> experience, and the workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E
