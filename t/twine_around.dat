500|$|Like many {{microscopic}} animals, gastrotrich locomotion {{is primarily}} powered by hydrostatics, but movement occurs through different methods in different {{members of the}} group. Chaetonotids only have adhesive glands at the back and, in them, locomotion typically proceeds in a smooth gliding manner; the whole body is propelled forward by the rhythmic action of the cilia on the ventral surface. In the pelagic chaetonotid genus Stylochaeta, however, movement proceeds in jerks as the long, muscle-activated spines are forced rhythmically towards {{the side of the}} body. By contrast, with chaetonotids, macrodasyidans typically have multiple adhesive glands and move forward with a creeping action similar to that of a [...] "looper" [...] caterpillar. In response to a threat, the head and trunk can be rapidly pulled backwards, or the creeping movement can be reversed. Muscular action is important when the animal turns sideways and during copulation, when two individuals <b>twine</b> <b>around</b> each other.|$|E

2500|$|A twine binder is a {{mechanical}} device or machine that wraps knotted <b>twine</b> <b>around</b> a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form {{after it has}} been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857, John Appleby invented the twine knotter. Incorporating many of Jacob Behel's innovations as found in his development of the [...] "billhook" [...] knotter in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby's twine knotter into a commercially profitable reaper-binder.|$|E

6000|$|Late in {{the morning}} of Saturday, the 9th December, I set out, {{accompanied}} by Rirash and the End of Time, to visit some ruins a little way distant from the direct road. After an hour's ride we turned away from the Abbaso Fiumara and entered a basin among the hills distant about sixteen miles from the Holy Tree. This is the site of Darbiyah Kola,--Kola's Fort,--so called from its Galla queen. It is said that this city and its neighbour Aububah fought like certain cats in Kilkenny till both were [...] "eaten up:" [...] the Gudabirsi fix the event at the period when their forefathers still inhabited Bulhar on the coast,--about 300 years ago. If the date be correct, the substantial ruins have fought a stern fight with time. Remnants of houses cumber the soil, and the carefully built wells are filled with rubbish: the palace was pointed out to me with its walls of stone and clay intersected by layers of woodwork. The mosque is a large roofless building containing twelve square pillars of rude masonry, and the Mihrab, or prayer niche, is denoted by a circular arch of tolerable construction. But the voice of the Muezzin is hushed for ever, and creepers now <b>twine</b> <b>around</b> the ruined fane.
