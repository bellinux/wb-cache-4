5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown.

Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices at <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
40|$|Parametric {{electron}} pump through superconductor-carbon-nanotube based molecular devices was investigated. It is {{found that a}} dc current, which is assisted by resonant Andreev reflection, can be pumped out from such molecular device by a cyclic variation of two gate voltages near <b>the</b> nanotube. <b>The</b> <b>pumped</b> current can be either positive or negative under different system parameters. Due to the Andreev reflection, <b>the</b> <b>pumped</b> current has <b>the</b> double peak structure around the resonant point. <b>The</b> ratio of <b>pumped</b> current of N-SWNT-S system to that of N-SWNT-N system (I^{NS}/I^N) is found to approach four in <b>the</b> weak <b>pumping</b> regime near <b>the</b> resonance when there is exactly one resonant level at Fermi energy inside the energy gap.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of inter-electron {{interactions}} on <b>the</b> charge <b>pumped</b> through an adiabatic quantum electron <b>pump.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pumping</b> is through a system of barriers, whose heights are deformed adiabatically. (Weak) interaction effects are introduced through a renormalisation group flow of the scattering matrices and <b>the</b> <b>pumped</b> charge is shown to always approach a quantised value at low temperatures or long length scales. The maximum value of <b>the</b> <b>pumped</b> charge is set by the number of barriers and is given by Q_ max = n_b - 1. The correlation between the transmission and <b>the</b> charge <b>pumped</b> is studied by seeing how much of the transmission is enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> contour. <b>The</b> (integer) value of <b>the</b> <b>pumped</b> charge at low temperatures is determined by the number of transmission maxima enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> contour. <b>The</b> dissipation at finite temperatures leading to the non-quantised values of <b>the</b> <b>pumped</b> charge scales as a power law with the temperature (Q-Q_ int∝ T^ 2 α), or with the system size (Q-Q_ int∝ L_s^- 2 α), where α {{is a measure of the}} interactions and vanishes at T= 0 (L_s=∞). For a double barrier system, our result agrees with <b>the</b> quantisation of <b>pumped</b> charge seen in Luttinger liquids.

5|$|In the Avon Valley to {{the east}} of Bath the classic {{geographical}} example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, once used for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal.

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> effects, in {{both the}} {{adiabatic}} and nonadiabatic regimes, {{of a pair of}} itfinite finger-gate array (FGA) on a narrow channel. Connection between <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> characteristics and associated mechanisms is established. <b>The</b> <b>pumping</b> potential is generated by ac biasing the FGA pair. For a single pair (N= 1) of finger gates (FG's), <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism is due to the coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron to its subband threshold. For a pair of FGA with pair number N> 2, <b>the</b> dominant <b>pumping</b> mechanism becomes that of the time-dependent Bragg reflection. The contribution of the time-dependent Bragg reflection to <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> is enabled by breaking the symmetry in the electron transmission when <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> potential is of a predominant propagating type. This propagating wave condition can be achieved both by an appropriate choice of the FGA pair configuration and by the monitoring of a phase difference ϕ between the ac biases in the FGA pair. The robustness of such a pumping mechanism is demonstrated by considering a FGA pair with only pair number N= 4. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881).
