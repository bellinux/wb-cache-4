5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were not considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong,</b> <b>and</b> were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with {{the possibility that the}} mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} their conquest, the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus identified elite native {{groups such as the}} priesthood of Judea – to help him rule his new subjects. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians. In the past, Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline. Past tyrants had also tended and needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place-men. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. On the eve of the Greco-Persian wars, it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{prolonged}} fermentation in ripened pu'erh and slow oxidization of aged raw pu'erh, these teas often lack the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, {{and can be}} brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of tea from one pot of leaves.

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E

500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction.

[...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before I start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the end of}} the Brood War and Kerrigan's defeat on Char, Kerrigan created {{numerous}} broodmothers, powerful s, each {{of which}} would lead a brood. The queens were ordered to evolve and only submit to the will of the strongest leader, which became a problem upon Kerrigan's defeat. The brood mothers scattered their broods. Kerrigan was forced to follow and attempt to subdue them. Following the eradication of the last cerebrates in Brood War, Kerrigan creates powerful and intelligent broodmothers to fulfill their role in the Swarm. Kerrigan commanded the broodmothers [...] "to fight, to conquer, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> to lead by force of will". Through decentralizing command hierarchy, Kerrigan ensured the Zerg Swarm could function without leadership. The strongest of these zerg broods, The Zagara Brood, was led by Zagara. Following Kerrigan's defeat and de-infestation on Char, the Zagara brood remained there, seeking large egg piles in an acid marsh. Despite General Horace Warfield's extermination campaign against the zerg remaining on the planet, the brood thrived while all others perished. Its prosperity was interrupted however, when Kerrigan returned to Char and subjugated Zagara, thereby putting the brood under Kerrigan's control.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} {{written and}} shot, when Apollo (Jamie Bamber) fires on the Olympic Carrier, {{it was made}} clear that he sees people inside. [...] Moore wrote the scene <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize [...] "the uncompromising nature of the show." [...] This was an [...] "enormous fight" [...] between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was [...] "too dark" [...] and {{had the potential to}} turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order. [...] To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and [...] "cheated"; instead, when Apollo flies by the Olympic Carrier, it is unclear {{whether or not there is}} anybody inside. [...] In a [...] "small act of defiance", visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel snuck in small, indeterminate movement behind one or two of the Olympic Carriers windows on behalf of the production and writing teams.

I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E
