5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, {{suggests}} frying the skewered oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer.|$|E
5|$|Squab pie is a mutton {{pie with}} a shortcrust pastry lid. It {{should be made}} {{with at least one}} layer of onions, {{followed}} by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops.

5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

5000|$|The works was {{situated}} by the dam marking the upper tidal {{limit of the}} river, where Swalwell Juniors F.C. now stands. The CPP which washed and blended the coal prior to the coking process stood at the north-eastern end of the site, along with large storage bunkers. A conveyor fed blended coal from these bunkers into another bunker on top of <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> which in turn fed the charging car. <b>The</b> <b>ovens</b> themselves were parallel to the A694, which passes the site, {{and stood on the}} area of land now occupied by the two football pitches. There were several railway sidings for both coal and coke between <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> and <b>the</b> road. The pusher was {{on the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>ovens,</b> and <b>the</b> coke was shoved out on the side nearest the road. The quenching tower was at the north-eastern end of <b>the</b> battery of <b>ovens,</b> near <b>the</b> CPP, and the chimney was at the opposite end. Between <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> and <b>the</b> river were the power plant with its associated boilers and chimneys, as well as the by-products plant. The latter [...] "scrubbed" [...] the gas produced in <b>the</b> <b>ovens,</b> extracting chemicals such as tar and ammonia, which were piped into storage tanks. The gas was then stored in a tall gas holder to the south-east of the site, near the river.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
50|$|It is a fallacy {{to report}} that <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> & Murray Football Association changed its name in 1911 to the Rutherglen & District Football Association. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> & Murray FA folded and ceased to exist in 1911. The {{previous}} years competition had attracted only three teams, Albury, Excelsior and premiers Rutherglen, and sides in the district refused to play against Rutherglen and Albury. <b>The</b> <b>Ovens</b> and Murray Junior Association held a meeting at McKays Hotel in Rutherglen on Wednesday April 19, 2011, attended among others by Messrs. Reid and Walter from Howlong, where a motion was carried {{to the effect that}} the Association change its name to the Rutherglen and District Football Association. The name change was necessary because if the Junior Association had continued under their original name, there would have been the impression that <b>the</b> <b>Ovens</b> & Murray Association still existed, which it did not.

5|$|The North-West and North-East towers {{behind the}} {{northern}} range are Norman in origin, from the 11th and early 12th century. When first built, {{they were created}} by pushing or folding {{the line of the}} curtain wall outwards to create the desired external shape, and then adding timber floors and a timber wall at the back, rather than being designed as individual buildings. The timber parts of the towers were later replaced in stone, and incorporated into the later range of buildings. The North-East Tower, also known as the Pendover Tower, was originally two-storeys high, with a third floor added on in the 14th century, followed by an extensive remodelling of the inside in the 16th century. It has chamfered angles on the external corners to make it harder to attack the stonework, although this has weakened the structural strength of the tower as a whole. The North-West Tower had similar chamfered corners, but the Closet Tower was built alongside it in the 13th century, altering the external appearance. Two more Norman towers survive in the innermost bailey, the West Tower, also known as the Postern Tower, because it contained a postern gate, and the South-West tower, also called <b>the</b> <b>Oven</b> Tower, on account of its cooking facilities. The Norman towers looked out towards Wales, probably to make a symbolic statement.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> and {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E
