50|$|The Air Ministry {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident was due to pilot error.

5000|$|Most {{flexible}} {{wings are}} set up with near neutral roll due <b>to</b> <b>sideslip</b> (anhedral effect). In the roll axis, the pilot shifts his body mass using the wing control bar, applying a rolling moment directly to the wing. The flexible wing is built to flex differentially across the span {{in response to the}} pilot applied roll moment. For example, if the pilot shifts his weight to the right, the right wing trailing edge flexes up more than the left, allowing the right wing to drop and slow down.|$|E

50|$|With {{high hopes}} of a British victory, the S.4, {{together}} with two Gloster III biplanes, was shipped to the United States of America for the 1925 race. During trials at Bay Shore Park, Baltimore on 23 October 1925, piloted by H. C. Biard, it was seen <b>to</b> <b>sideslip</b> into the water from 200 ft (61 m) and was wrecked. Biard, who survived with two broken ribs, stated that he lost control following violent wing vibration. The race was won two days later by Lieutenant James Doolittle, flying a Curtiss R3C at an average speed of 232.573 mph (374.443 km/h), faster than the S.4's world record of a month before.|$|E
5000|$|A {{maneuver}} that greatly {{resembles a}} tight barrel-roll is the rudder roll. The rudder roll {{differs from the}} barrel roll both in that the application of back-stick pressure (elevator) is usually very high and that aileron input is held neutral throughout the maneuver. Instead, roll is produced by creating a sideslip through application of rudder combined with elevator. The aircraft will roll {{in the direction of}} the rudder. This will cause the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>sideslip</b> through the roll, keeping the nose pointed at only a shallow angle from the flightpath. The aircraft will appear to slide at a slight angle around a very narrow, helical path, more like an imaginary pipe than a barrel.|$|E
50|$|A three channel RC plane will {{typically}} have an elevator and a throttle control, and either an aileron or rudder control but not both.If the plane has ailerons, rolling the wings {{left or right}} is accomplished directly by them. If the plane has a rudder instead, it will be designed with a greater amount of Dihedral Effect, which is the tendency for the airplane to roll in response <b>to</b> <b>sideslip</b> angle created by the rudder deflection. Dihedral Effect in model airplane design is usually increased by increasing the Dihedral Angle of the wing (V-bend in the wing). The rudder will yaw the plane so {{that it has a}} left or right sideslip, dihedral effect will then cause the plane to roll in the same direction. Many trainers, electric park fliers, and gliders use this technique.|$|E

5000|$|Preparing for her sixth jump, {{planned for}} 26 February {{the same year}} in Sydney, it was reported: [...] "During her five {{previous}} jumps, Miss Burns has left the plane from heights varying from 3,200 feet to 1,500 feet. After making her last leap she did not pull the rip cord until she had dropped nearly 500 feet, which rather worried some of her spectators. 'Until I am down to about 200 feet there is a beautiful floating sensation, and then suddenly the ground seems to rush up and meet me. Some parachutists can land on their feet, but usually I take a fall. The landing speed is about twelve miles an hour, and the jar {{is about the same}} as you would get if you jumped off a fifteen-foot wall,' said Miss Burns. 'In the air you can lose height more rapidly by pulling a handful of cords which causes the 'chute <b>to</b> <b>sideslip.</b> There are four red cords which you can pull on the ground to spill the air out so you are not dragged too far.' Mr. Felix Mueller, a licensed parachutist, instructed Miss Burns, and supervises the folding of her parachute, which is a very important item - a twisted cord or a wrong fold of silk would probably mean tragedy." [...] She was also quoted as saying she had taken up jumping to raise funds to buy an aeroplane. [...] The jump, from 2,000 feet over Kingsford Smith Airport, resulted in Burns suffering a cut to the chin during descent and abrasions from being dragged along the ground on landing, and she again received treatment from ambulancemen.|$|E
