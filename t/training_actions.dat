Processing addresses the Scientologist's [...] "case" [...] or how they function in life as influenced by their [...] "aberrations".

Participants feel that this knowledge greatly enhances their ability to be effective in life whether they audit another or not. Scientologists can travel up either side of the Bridge and many do both sides.

40|$|Experimental competences allow {{engineering}} students to consolidate knowledge and skills. Remote labs are {{a powerful tool}} to aid students in those developments. The VISIR remote lab was considered the best remote lab {{in the world in}} 2015. The VISIR+ project main goal is to spread VISIR usage in Brazil and Argentina, providing technical and didactical sup- port. This paper presents an analysis of the already prosecuted actions regarding this project and an assessment of their impact in terms of conditioning factors. The overall outcomes are highly positive since, in each Latin American Higher Education Institution, all <b>training</b> <b>actions</b> were successful, the first didactical implementations were designed and ongoing in the current semester. In some cases, instead of one foreseen implementation, there are several. The most statistically conditioning factors which affected the outcomes were the pre-experience with re- mote labs, the pre-experience with VISIR and the <b>training</b> <b>actions</b> duration. The teachers’ per- ceptions that most conditioned their enrollment in implementing VISIR in their courses were related to their consciousness of the VISIR effectiveness to teach and learn. The lack of time to practice and discuss their doubts and the fulfillment of their expectations in the <b>training</b> <b>actions,</b> also affected how comfortable in modifying their course curricula teachers were. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|E

The main aim is to describe and analyse the conditions which define the situation of graduates in relation to their expectations for entry into the labour market. To do so a questionnaire is drawn up and filled in before the completion of studies. Two key concepts have been established from this research, 1) the capacity for entrepreneurship in the work market and 2) the need for the university to develop <b>training</b> <b>actions</b> for labour guidance and insertion. Specifically, the results show that students do not find a stable link between the education received and the labour market, and this implies that a very high percentage of them do not feel qualified to begin work. Moreover, data suggests that all students feel an increase in <b>training</b> <b>actions</b> to encourage their access to the labour market is a major priority...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: to {{investigate}} indicators of physical quality {{of speed and}} components of its elements. Material & Methods: girls of three age groups of different sports qualification, who specialize in rowing, were examined. Rate, time and speed of the single movement, frequency of movements were defined by the developed by us technique of measurement of effect of <b>training</b> <b>action,</b> and also sensomotor reactions to sound and light irritants when modeling conditions of training and competitive activity were investigated. Results: the conducted researches characterize specific psychophysiological features of organism of a sportsman. It is possible to apply the offered technique of the research of effect of <b>training</b> <b>action</b> to the purposeful studying and development of physical quality of speed in the training process. Formation and improvement of motor abilities in the concrete aged ranges is carried out in connection with high rates of development of morphological and functional indicators in the sensitive periods. Conclusions: the age of 13 – 18 years has the most optimum prerequisites {{for the improvement of}} motive qualities and formation of speed of movements.
