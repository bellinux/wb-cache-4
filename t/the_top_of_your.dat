500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} the songs, Gunn revealed he [...] "started {{the process by}} reading the Billboard charts {{for all of the}} top hits of the '70s", downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar — ones you recognize but {{might not be able to}} name off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he [...] "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house — sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." [...] Most of the songs were played on set to help [...] "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with David Bowie's [...] "Moonage Daydream" [...] the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with [...] "Hooked on a Feeling" [...] in mind; however once Gunn discovered [...] "Come and Get Your Love", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a [...] "better fit." ...|$|E

50|$|The Employment Contracts Act was {{deliberately}} intended to individualise the employment relationship. It {{was a natural}} outcome of the ideological propaganda of rugged individualism, of self-interest and greed and the appeal to individuals that you could find better for you by climbing over <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> colleagues, your mates, and so on. Ruth Richardson was very clear, very blunt, very honest about its purpose. It was to achieve a dramatic lowering of wages, very, very quickly.|$|R
500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's [...] got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out." ...|$|E

The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass.

It bore no relation to the producer's chart-topping single of the same title some months earlier. [...] "This was a guy whose records I used to play when I was at school," [...] said Hardcastle. [...] "He was a hero of mine – I couldn't work out why he wanted to work with me. He said to me, 'You're at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> game technically right now, so can you help me?'" [...] The producer played the bassline on Lynott's Fender.

And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E

When choosing the songs, Gunn read the Billboard charts for all of the top hits of the 1970s, downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar—ones you recognize but {{might not be able to}} name off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally.
