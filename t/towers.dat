5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached <b>towers,</b> called Albarrana <b>towers,</b> around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the <b>towers</b> provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the <b>towers</b> were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Another {{series of}} <b>towers</b> were built between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen <b>towers</b> {{were built in}} all, which are {{together}} known as the De Redin <b>towers.</b> These {{were based on the}} Lascaris <b>towers</b> and had the same function as a communication link. 13 <b>towers</b> were built on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins. The fourteenth tower, Mġarr ix-Xini Tower, was built on Gozo in 1661 with a slightly different design.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, more <b>towers</b> were {{built around the}} islands. The first group, the Wignacourt <b>towers,</b> were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six <b>towers,</b> one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four <b>towers</b> survive to this day.|$|E
50|$|Examples include Jashar Pasha's <b>Tower,</b> Haxhi Zeka's <b>Tower,</b> Xhafer Syla's <b>Tower,</b> Mazrekaj <b>Tower,</b> Janjevo <b>Tower.</b>|$|R
25|$|St. George's <b>Tower,</b> Dwejra <b>Tower,</b> St. Agatha's <b>Tower,</b> Għajn Tuffieħa <b>Tower</b> and Lippija <b>Tower</b> {{were all}} {{restored}} between the late 1990s and 2013.

50|$|The <b>Tower</b> Hotel was {{originally}} called the Seagram <b>Tower,</b> {{named after the}} House of Seagram business in Montreal. Over the years, due to multiple bankruptcies and ownership changes, <b>tower</b> names changed between Heritage <b>Tower</b> (1969), Royal Inn <b>Tower</b> (1971), Royal Center <b>Tower</b> (1972), Panasonic <b>Tower</b> (1973), Minolta <b>Tower</b> (1984-2003), and Konica Minolta <b>Tower</b> Centre (2003-2007) with the merger of Konica and Minolta in 2003. The <b>tower</b> underwent renovations again in 2010, resulting in the exterior painted white, the banner displaying Konica Minolta being replaced by the title <b>Tower</b> Hotel, {{and the removal of}} the clock.|$|R
5|$|On the World Trade Center site, {{three more}} office <b>towers</b> are {{expected}} to be built one block east of where the original <b>towers</b> stood. Construction has begun on all three of these <b>towers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seven more <b>towers</b> {{were built}} between 1637 and 1638. These were {{much smaller than}} the Wignacourt <b>towers,</b> as they were built as watchtowers and a {{communication}} link to warn the Order's base in the Grand Harbour of an attack. In 1647, Saint Agatha's Tower was built in Mellieħa. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and was built {{in the style of the}} Wignacourt <b>towers.</b> Two more <b>towers</b> were built at Dwejra and Xlendi on Gozo in 1650 and 1652. The ten <b>towers</b> built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the Lascaris <b>towers</b> after the Grand Master who built them, and nine of them survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|The D-shaped <b>towers</b> {{along the}} curtain wall {{are similar to}} those of several other Saxon Shore forts, {{although}} their placement is somewhat unusual. Because the fort was partly surrounded by marshes and water, which provided natural defences, the Romans economised by only building <b>towers</b> on the more vulnerable north-eastern and far western sectors. The <b>towers</b> were probably used to mount artillery weapons such as catapults and heavy crossbows. Ten <b>towers</b> still survive, though there may originally have been more before the loss of the south wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{western front}} facade {{is flanked by}} two square <b>towers.</b> They are both three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both <b>towers</b> have windows at each level. Access to the <b>towers</b> is through either of two small wooden doors located in the {{interior}} northwest and southwest corners of the church vestibule.|$|E
5|$|<b>Towers</b> A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The <b>towers</b> {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly in their living accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in <b>Towers</b> A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These measurements are not exact, however, because the three <b>towers</b> are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two <b>Towers</b> is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two <b>Towers</b> and many are less linear. Unlike The Two <b>Towers,</b> The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

The Gerbrandy <b>Tower</b> {{is not the only}} <b>tower</b> which consists of a concrete <b>tower</b> on which a guyed mast is set. There is one similar but smaller <b>tower</b> with the same structure in the Netherlands, the radio <b>tower</b> of Zendstation Smilde, which consisted of an 80 meter high concrete <b>tower,</b> on which a 223.5 meter high guyed mast was mounted. This structure collapsed after a fire on July 15th, 2011. Rebuilding of that <b>tower</b> started in late 2011 and is planned to be complete around August 2012; the replacement structure will also be {{a partially}} guyed <b>tower.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Panther Central, the <b>Towers</b> Lobby which connects {{all three}} <b>towers,</b> and the dining {{services}} {{located on the}} ground floor are accessible to everyone, only residents are allowed in the individual <b>towers</b> and must present their student ID card to a 24-hour security guard to gain entrance. Visitors to any of the <b>Towers</b> must be signed in by a resident of the Tower, and must present either their student ID card if they are a student or a valid form of photographic identification if they are not. Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2:00 AM. If not, an overnight stay request must be completed, of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester. No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time.|$|E
5|$|Although single western <b>towers</b> {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it was framed by two lower lateral <b>towers,</b> one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern <b>towers</b> of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Alton <b>Towers</b> {{conceived}} {{the concept of}} a flying roller coaster in 1990, twelve years before Air eventually opened. Following the opening of Nemesis in 1994, a flying coaster was planned by the park to open in 1998, but was delayed due to technological limitations. During its development, Alton <b>Towers</b> marketed the ride as Secret Weapon 5 (abbreviated to SW5), following the naming pattern established for previous major park developments. The ride was developed in part by ride designer John Wardley, the producer of many attractions at Alton <b>Towers</b> and other former Tussauds Group theme parks.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these <b>towers</b> range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired <b>towers</b> at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three <b>towers,</b> the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western <b>towers</b> are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many fortresses, Golubac's {{structure}} was modified over time. For years, there were only five <b>towers.</b> Later, four more were added. The <b>towers</b> were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel. Once firearms came into use, the Turks fortified the western <b>towers</b> with cannon ports and polygonal or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick. After the Hungarian raid in 1481, they added the final tower, complete with cannon embrasures and galleries.|$|E
