5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|Metro relies {{extensively}} on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. governments, which are represented on Metro's board of directors. The {{system does not}} have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit systems do. Critics allege <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E
5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E

5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} {{has been}} disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated {{a section of}} his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated these conclusions. Newton also asserts <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> always been the accepted narrative in post-war literature.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{to do with the}} idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{team made}} a poor {{start in the}} final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had {{occurred}} after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory {{was the first time that}} Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.|$|E

25|$|The {{hierarchical}} system of Zen has attracted severe {{criticism in the}} west, because of the misconception of the role and degree of awakening of Zen teachers.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the invasion, the Iraqi media {{establishment}} changed drastically.
