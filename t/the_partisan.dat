5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters and <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina {{were based}} {{in the area of}} operations, with Tito's Supreme Headquarters {{directly}} controlling the 1st Proletarian Brigade, and the General Staff, commanded by Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, controlling <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> detachments in East Bosnia under the overall direction of the Supreme Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Operation Maibaum had {{not only}} stopped <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 3rd Corps from {{crossing}} the Drina into Serbia, it had scattered <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> formation. On 6 May, V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division {{to return to the}} security zone north of the Spreča.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Trio and {{the joint}} Italian-Chetnik offensive, the Partisans formed three more Proletarian Brigades, {{consisting}} mainly of Montenegrins. Operation Trio contributed to the decision of <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters to withdraw to western Bosnia in <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Long March, which commenced in late June 1942.|$|E
50|$|More recent {{publications}} {{have cast}} {{the events in}} a different light, stating that <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> selected Dražgoše as a scene to challenge the German forces. The villagers asked <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> forces to leave the village, but they refused; then, when the German forces attacked, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> fled. According to Corsellis and Ferrar, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> believed that uprisings {{such as the one}} at Dražgoše and the resulting reprisals turned the population against the Germans. The Catholic populace considered that <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> staged such uprisings in or near Catholic villages deliberately so that Catholics would be targeted by reprisals.|$|R
50|$|On 23 November <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> {{captured}} and executed several Chetnik commanders near Nova Varoš. This action compromised <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> in <b>the</b> {{eyes of many}} Serbs from Sjenica who developed animosity toward them. As a result, many Serbs from Sjenica joined forces of the town's militsiya to defend the town from <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Partisans</b> then {{committed}} <b>the</b> 16th Vojvodina Division {{to assist}} the 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation Heiderose to this point. On 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began to search for <b>the</b> hidden <b>Partisan</b> bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten <b>Partisan</b> bases, which <b>the</b> cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> in previous days.|$|R
5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The {{inability of the}} 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew {{in the direction of}} Goražde.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E
5|$|At about 05:00 on 26 May, a Luftwaffe {{fighter-bomber}} formation engaged <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> troops {{withdrawing from}} Drvar. The western column of the 92nd Motorised Regiment kampfgruppe {{was ordered to}} help assist the eastern column by detaching a reinforced Panzer company from Vrtoče.|$|E
50|$|On 8 July 1942 <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> {{attacked}} an Italian stronghold at {{the rectory}} in Dobrova. On {{the following day}} the village was burned. On 20 November 1942 <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> abducted and killed seven people from the nearby village of Zaklanec in the Broad Creek Gorge. On 27 January 1943 <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> burned down <b>the</b> newly built six-year school in Dobrova.|$|R
25|$|Later {{the same}} day, NDH generals Slavko Štancer, Vjekoslav Servatzy and Vladimir Metikoš oversaw the {{surrender}} to <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b> British army reports say Štancer {{had previously been}} captured by <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> when they strayed from the column, seeking the British. The surrender continued for several days and at various locations; it took until 21 May for Tito to order <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> to withdraw from Carinthia.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Partisans</b> emerged {{stronger}} than before and now occupied {{a more significant}} portion of Yugoslavia. The events greatly increased the standing of <b>the</b> <b>Partisans,</b> and granted them a favorable reputation among the Yugoslav populace, leading to increased recruitment. On 8 September 1943, Fascist Italy capitulated to the Allied powers, leaving their occupation zone in Yugoslavia open to <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b> Tito {{took advantage of the}} events by briefly liberating the Dalmatian shore and its cities. This secured for <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> Italian weaponry and supplies, volunteers from the cities previously annexed by Italy, and Italian recruits crossing over to the Allies (the Garibaldi Division).|$|R
5|$|On 3 April 2009, the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights {{announced}} that mass graves containing {{the remains of}} approximately 4,500 members of the division had been discovered near Zaprešić. Locals indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 21st Serbian Division {{was responsible for the}} massacre.|$|E
5|$|Operation Trio {{coincided with}} {{and contributed to}} the {{polarisation}} of the almost exclusively Serb rebels in eastern Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans. Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause. Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership of all but one of <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> detachments in eastern Bosnia, and these detachments effectively defected to the Chetniks. Most of the surviving communist fighters from these detachments rejoined <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Long March. Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left in eastern Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment. All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region. The Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia, at best a confederacy of local warlords, was strengthened by mass defections from the Partisans. For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Panzer Army was {{monitoring}} the operation closely. The {{report of a}} special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans’ rear {{with the help of}} disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According to this report, received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> lines in order to kill Tito and destroy <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, a number of pioneers, and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> territory that night, it tried again the following night.|$|E
50|$|By late 1944, {{the total}} forces of <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> {{numbered}} 650,000 {{men and women}} organized in four field armies and 52 divisions, which engaged in conventional warfare. By April 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> numbered over 800,000.|$|R
5000|$|In September <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> with Red Army support {{began their}} final {{offensive}} in Serbia. In mid-September 1944, a corps unit saved Draža Mihailović and the Chetnik Supreme Command in northwest Serbia from capture by <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 1942, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> {{captured}} Bošković in {{the village}} of Vrba, near Gacko. He was captured together with nine other Chetniks, including Captain Radojica Rončević and Vidak Kovačević. <b>The</b> <b>Partisans</b> and their captives headed toward Partisan Montenegrin HQ in Nikšić, but they were intercepted by Chetniks commanded by the priest Perišić who released Bošković and arrested <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b> Against <b>the</b> order of Bošković, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> were released. This angered Josip Broz Tito so much that he ordered establishing a special unit, which included Partisans released by Todorović, with the only one purpose — to find and execute Todorović at any cost, and appointed Vlado Šegrt as its commander.|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} was of limited effectiveness due to several factors, including preemptive {{action by the}} Ustaše militia and Italian delays. The area of operations straddled the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation within the NDH, which led to mutual suspicion and lack of coordination. Both insurgent factions avoided fighting the Axis and NDH forces, instead focusing on fighting each other. After Operation Trio, <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> leader Josip Broz Tito, his Supreme Headquarters and <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> main force, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades, withdrew from their base of operations around Foča. After briefly reorganising around Zelengora mountain south-east of Foča, they moved their operations to western Bosnia {{for the remainder of}} 1942.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment (9/28) {{displayed}} what {{could still be}} achieved by the Bosnians under determined leadership when Leutnant Hans König ambushed <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 17th Majevica Brigade near Vukosavci, killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations. König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{fighting}} with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments were aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E
50|$|In May of {{the same}} year, German, Italian, Bulgarian and Croatian troops {{launched}} a fifth concerted offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> in south eastern Bosnia, near the Sutjeska river. Again, faced by superior enemy numbers and potential encirclement, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> escaped defeat but not without cost. However, the fact that after their successful breakout <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> were still able to mount major counter offensives {{proved to be a}} turning point in the battle for control of Yugoslavia. When Italy surrendered in September, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> were further aided by captured Italian armour, control of additional coastal territory, and the shipment of supplies from the Allies in Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The eunuchs {{were not}} content with just {{removing}} <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> from government. In 169, they persuaded the 13-year-old Emperor Ling that <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> were intent on rebellion. [...] <b>The</b> leading <b>partisans,</b> including Li, Du, Fan Pang (范滂), were arrested and executed. Overall, about 100 people lost their lives. Many <b>partisans</b> hid, with <b>the</b> assistance of an underground network who largely renamed anonymous even later, but included such eventually-important figures as Yuan Shao and Kong Rong. <b>The</b> <b>partisans</b> who {{were not on the}} arrest rolls had their liberties further restricted.|$|R
50|$|Operation Beta {{followed}} on {{the heels}} of Operation Alfa in which Italian forces retook Prozor from <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b> Ten Italian battalions and two Ustaše battalions took the city from <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> with neither side suffering many casualties.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 3 October 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 28th Slavonia Division {{assaulted}} a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of the encirclement to the north, {{the rest of the}} reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> advance at heavy cost. Rushing towards Janja from the east, III/27 came into contact with Partisans around Modran, reaching the Janja garrison at 10pm that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At dawn the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. Jagdkommandos were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1944, Mickl was {{promoted}} to Generalleutnant. He identified that <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury, hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages, basements, and even in fake graves in cemeteries. This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated. In mid-April, Mickl ordered Operation Keulenschlag (Mace Blow) to clear the area, using the 846th Infantry Regiment {{and parts of the}} 847th Infantry Regiment, supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion. Over the next two weeks, the division pushed <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 13th Division north to the area of Mrkopalj and Delnice, and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions, including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1944, Tito {{offered a}} general amnesty {{and many in}} the {{division}} took advantage of this opportunity. During {{the first three weeks}} of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or went over to the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 3rd Corps by early October.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> German–Yugoslav <b>Partisan</b> {{negotiations}} were held between German {{commanders in the}} Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of <b>the</b> Yugoslav <b>Partisans</b> in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during the Axis Case White offensive. They were used by <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> to delay <b>the</b> Axis forces while <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> crossed <b>the</b> Neretva river, and to allow <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The {{negotiations were}} accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about six weeks before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> through <b>the</b> negotiations was lost when the Axis Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between <b>the</b> Germans and <b>Partisans</b> for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued {{until the end of}} the war.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>partisan</b> {{groups in}} <b>the</b> area, the Bielski group would raid nearby villages and {{forcibly}} seize food; on occasion, peasants {{who refused to}} share their food with <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> were <b>the</b> subject of violence and even murder. This caused hostility towards <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> from peasants in the villages, though some would willingly help <b>the</b> Jewish <b>partisans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> from Montenegro, <b>the</b> Chetniks repeated the same mistakes <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> had made, establishing prison camps, conducting show trials and killing indiscriminately. These actions were not just targeted at the remaining communists, but also against the Sandzak Muslims. Chetnik massacres of Muslims were perpetrated in particular in the towns of Bijelo Polje, Pljevlja and the village of Bukovica. This resulted in the Muslims establishing village militias to defend against both <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> and Chetniks.|$|R
5|$|On 17 July, the {{operation}} began. Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment, while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to Udrč before dusk without serious opposition. Early on 18 July, the Chetniks attacked from Matkovac towards Šekovići. The 27th Regiment reached Bačkovac and seized {{the high ground}} south of Šekovići on 19 July 1944. The 28th Regiment forced <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 36th Vojvodina Division back. The battalion from 7th SS Division encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through. On 19 July, the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje Petrovice to attack <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 12th Corps at Živinice. The reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division pushed in from Vareš as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the area}} was secured, {{defensive}} positions were established along the Čelić–Lopare road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance. On the night of 17–18 March, elements of <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 16th Vojvodina Division and 36th Vojvodina Division mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and Zabrđe, losing over 200.|$|E
5|$|The ambitious goal of Operation Maibaum (Maypole) was {{to destroy}} <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> 3rd Corps. Army Group F ordered V SS Mountain Corps {{to form a}} {{blockade}} along the Drina to prevent <b>the</b> <b>Partisan</b> force from crossing into Serbia. Operation Maibaum {{was one of the}} largest counter-insurgency operations of World War II and included 7th SS Division and NDH forces. The 13th SS Division was under the command of V SS Corps, and the primary tasks of the division were to capture Tuzla and Zvornik, then drive south parallel with the Drina to meet other Corps elements. The original plan included the parachute insertion of 500th SS Parachute Battalion into the Vlasenica area, but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather. Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area. The deployment south of the Spreča, and therefore outside the security zone, during Operation Maibaum was ordered by the corps commander, Phleps, despite opposition from Sauberzweig. This caused friction between the two that eventually required Himmler's intervention.|$|E
50|$|In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General Fitzroy Maclean was parachuted to Tito's {{headquarters}} near Drvar {{to serve}} as a permanent, formal liaison to <b>the</b> <b>Partisans.</b> While <b>the</b> Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> received <b>the</b> bulk of all future support.|$|R
50|$|The Republic of Užice was a {{short-lived}} liberated territory established by <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> and <b>the</b> first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organized {{as a military}} mini-state {{that existed in the}} autumn of 1941 in the west of occupied Serbia. By late 1944, the Belgrade Offensive swung in favour of <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> in <b>the</b> civil war; <b>the</b> <b>partisans</b> subsequently gained control of Yugoslavia. Following the Belgrade Offensive, the Syrmian Front was the last major military action of World War II in Serbia.|$|R
25|$|Commencing on 31 March 1942, {{and against}} German wishes, Francetić {{launched}} an independent offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> and Chetniks in eastern Bosnia. The Black Legion quickly captured Drinjača, Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica from <b>the</b> <b>Partisans</b> and defeated larger Chetnik forces led by Major Jezdimir Dangić.|$|R
