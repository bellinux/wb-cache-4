25|$|The Renegade {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} of aluminium square tubing extrusions and fittings, fastened with Avex rivets. The <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> and engine cowling {{are made from}} fibreglass. The fin, rudder, horizontal stabilizer and elevators are built from aluminum tubing and channel sections. The tail is wire-braced. A manual trim tab mounted on the elevator is an option. The landing gear is of conventional configuration and incorporates bungee suspension. The welded engine mount is 4130 steel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{horizontal}} protection {{over the}} magazines {{consisted of three}} layers with a total thickness of 9.13inches; the weather deck consisted of 1.25inches of D steel, the main armoured deck was 5.88inches thick over a [...]5-inch D steel deck and above the shell rooms there was another 1.5-inch splinter deck. The powder magazines were below the shell rooms for added protection, a practice that was begun with the Nelson-class battleships. The weatherdeck thickness was the same over the machinery spaces but there the main armoured deck was reduced to 4.88inches over a [...]5-inch D steel deck. The main armoured deck was continued forward of the forward armoured bulkhead and gradually reduced from full thickness to 2.5inches, while aft of the after magazines an armoured <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> covered the steering gear with 4.5–5inches of armour whilst also providing protection along the waterline.|$|E
5000|$|Enclosed cockpit with cut-down rear <b>turtle</b> <b>deck,</b> {{standard}} {{empty weight}} 250 lb, wingspan of 30.0 ft, standard engine Rotax 277 of [...] First flight 1986.|$|E
5000|$|She {{was built}} by Harvey's of Hayle. She was fitted with a <b>turtle</b> back <b>deck,</b> long bridge, {{promenade}} quarter deck, Walker’s patent windlass, patent anchors, saloon, fore and aft cabins. The launch was carried out on 2 February 1889 by Mrs Field of Marazion. She was named Lyonesse {{as it is a}} country in Arthurian legend said to border Cornwall. In later traditions Lyonesse is said to have sunk beneath the waves some time after the Tristan stories take place, making it similar to Ys and other lost lands in medieval Celtic tales, and perhaps connecting it with the Isles of Scilly. She carried two funnels close together, with black tops.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{attraction}} at the Seabird Centre is {{the network of}} cameras which allow visitors to observe gannets, puffins, shags, cormorants and other seabirds. Additional wildlife includes seals, dolphins and whales. Visitors may take remote control of solar-powered cameras, sited on the islands and key sites around the Firth of Forth. The cameras stream video onto giant screens, allowing the user to witness the birds nesting. The Discovery Centre also has a Wildlife Theatre, Kids' Zone with soft play and Kids' Corner, fish tanks, Scope <b>Deck,</b> <b>Turtle</b> & Ray Zone, gift shop and licensed cafe with an outdoor sun deck overlooking the sea. There are workshops and science shows for families during school holidays, {{and there is a}} year-round programme of events and festivals. The Centre also organises a programme of walks, including a free guided early bird beach walk every month. The Seabird Centre runs Seabird Seafari boat trips, from North Berwick Harbour, to the islands from Easter to October. The Centre also has exclusive landing rights for Bass Rock, owned by Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, and home to the world's largest colony of Northern gannets. These 5 hour guided round trips, which leave from Dunbar Harbour in the fishing trawler Fisher Lassie, must be booked well in advance through the centre. Landing trips to the Isle of May are available departing from North Berwick, as well as hour-long trips around the Bass Rock on board the 55-seat catamaran and 12-seat RIBs.|$|R
5000|$|Open cockpit {{parasol wing}} with flat rear <b>turtle</b> <b>deck,</b> {{standard}} empty weight 242 lb, wingspan of 28.0 ft, standard engine Rotax 277 of [...] First flight 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Enclosed cockpit with fast-back rear <b>turtle</b> <b>deck,</b> {{standard}} {{empty weight}} 285 lb, wingspan of 30.0 ft, standard engine Rotax 447 of [...] Includes extra fuel, landing gear shock absorbers, and wheel pants. First flight 1987.|$|E
5000|$|A genuine T-bucket has the {{two-seater}} {{body of a}} Model T roadster (with {{or without}} the <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> or small pickup box), this [...] "bucket"-shaped body shell giving the cars their name. A Model T-style radiator is usually fitted, and even these can sometimes be barely {{up to the task}} of cooling the large engines fitted. Windshields, when fitted, are vertical glass like the original Model T.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{seats in}} {{side-by-side}} configuration cabin light aircraft with a gross weight of 1200 lb and {{powered by a}} [...] Rotax 912 four-stroke engine. First flown in 1995. Fuselage differs from the XS in that the rear window is eliminated and replaced with a high rear <b>turtle</b> <b>deck,</b> rendering the aircraft similar in appearance to a Piper J-3 Cub, Aeronca Champ or Taylorcraft B.|$|E

50|$|She {{sported a}} partial <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> forward and shorter funnels than later ships of this type. She was {{designed}} {{to act as a}} leader of a destroyer flotilla but like other ships of this type was soon proved to be too slow for the role. As turbine engined destroyers came into service, they were rendered obsolete. She was armed with ten 12-pounder (76-mm) quick firing guns, eight 3-pounder (47-mm) quick firing guns and two 18-inch (460-mm) torpedo tubes. In 1911-12 she was rearmed with nine QF 4-inch (101.6-mm) Mk IV guns.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} riveted sheet aluminum with a rounded <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> and flat sides and bottom skins. Its 24.2 ft span wing employs a NACA 64A212 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64A210 at the wingtip. Standard engines used include the [...] Lycoming O-320, the [...] Lycoming O-360 and the fuel-injected [...] Lycoming IO-360 four-stroke powerplants. Standard fuel capacity is 25 US gallons, but optional wet wings increase the fuel capacity to 61 US gallons. Several other fuel tank options are available. A folding wing option may be installed.|$|E
50|$|During an {{era when}} biplanes were still common, {{the use of a}} {{monoplane}} planform, a NACA engine cowl, and large wheel pants significantly reduced aerodynamic drag, creating a streamlined design. Construction of the fuselage and wings was based on a plywood structure with the thin wings braced with wires. The sleek, polished fuselage continued the shape and width of the cowl throughout, with the cockpit featuring a small windshield, set nearly flush with the skin. A <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> extended from the cockpit to the vertical tail creating a fairing for the helmeted head of the pilot.|$|E
50|$|Harrier Hawk I {{is based}} on Guizhou Central, another UAV {{designed}} by GAIC. Harrier Hawk I and Guizhou Central UAVs both share the identical conventional layout with low wing configuration, {{as well as the}} retractable tricycle land gear system. However, the fuelage of Harrier Hawk I is different than that of Guizhou Central in that instead of having an extremely smooth shuttle shaped fuselage of Guizhou Central, the fuselage of Harrier Hawk I is shaped in the form of <b>turtle</b> <b>deck</b> cokpit. Another distinction between Guizhou Central and Harrier Hawk I is that the winglets of Harrier Hawk I is much larger than that of Guizhou Central. Maiden flight of Harrier Hawk I was completed on March, 31, 2013.|$|E
