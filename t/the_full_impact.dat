We conclude that the choice of an appropriate model - in particular, a dynamic model - is crucial to arrive at valid cost-effectiveness ratios.

500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>impact</b> of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
