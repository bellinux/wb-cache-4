Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a time <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>with</b> family and could last 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day. Unlike other cultures, lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E

25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>with</b> the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|In the inter-war period, {{officers}} led a [...] "country club existence". They {{had a high}} social standing, {{equivalent to}} that of an upper-middle-class professional.

They and their families had access to free medical and dental care. They had free life insurance, and an adequate salary, which could be stretched because Army commissaries and post exchanges sold many everyday goods tax-free. [...] They invariably lived on-base in good housing, and in tight-knit and supportive communities. When posted overseas, they took their families with them. A secure and steady job was highly prized during the Great Depression years from 1929 to 1939, and resignations were rare.|$|E

2500|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{believe that}} the seventh day of the week, Saturday, is the biblical Sabbath which God set [...] "apart for the lofty purpose of {{enriching}} the divine-human relationship". It is noted that the Sabbath is a recurring message in the Bible, mentioned in the Creation account, at Sinai, in the ministry of Jesus Christ and in the ministries of the apostles. The Sabbath serves as a weekly memorial to Creation and {{is a symbol of}} redemption, from both Egypt and sin. By keeping the Sabbath, Adventists are reminded of the way that God can make them holy, like he did the Sabbath, and they show their loyalty to God by keeping the commandment in the Decalogue. The Sabbath is also a time for Adventists <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>with</b> other people and with God.|$|E
2500|$|Yellowcard {{announced}} {{in an interview}} in April 2008 that the group would be going on an [...] "indefinite hiatus." [...] The band's European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and they instead embarked on an acoustic tour in the spring of 2008 before going on hiatus. Among the reasons for the band's hiatus were individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and joined a side project band based in Jacksonville, Florida. Sean Mackin got married in 2008 and wanted to take some time off <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>with</b> his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some time to figure out their personal lives. The band members were unsure of the hiatus' length, but they assured their fans they planned to return as a group. In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned. On June 16, 2009, Capitol released an EP titled Deep Cuts, which consists of four previously released tracks.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, INXS made a brief {{stopover}} in Japan {{to play a}} {{small number}} of shows and festivals in Tokyo and Yokohama, before flying on to Australia on October 14 to begin the first segment of the Calling All Nations tour. By the time the Kick tour had reached Australia, INXS were global superstars, especially Hutchence, who was now seen as a world-class live performer. Since the culmination of the Kick tour in November 1988, INXS agreed to a one-year respite, allowing the member's time off <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>with</b> their families and to work on side projects. Bass guitarist Garry Gary Beers recalls, [...] "By the end off that tour we were completely exhausted and burnt out. I mean we'd done Listen Like Thieves, toured on that for ages, recorded Kick straight away and then toured for 16months". During 1989, Hutchence collaborated with Ian 'Ollie' Olsen on a side project, Max Q, the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein's film Dogs in Space. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but returned to the studio to record their follow-up album X (1990).|$|E
