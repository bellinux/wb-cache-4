5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{there are}} 33 horse breeds on the equine CPL, {{comprising}} seventeen {{in the critical}} category, seven in <b>the</b> <b>threatened,</b> five in the watch, three in the recovering and one in study. There are also three breeds of asses, one {{in each of the}} critical, threatened and recovering categories. On the CPL for all other livestock species there are 10 pig breeds: seven in the critical category, one threatened, one watched, and one in the study. The 19 cattle breeds listed include eight in the critical category, two in <b>the</b> <b>threatened,</b> three in the watch, five recovering and one in the study. The list contains 23 sheep breeds: five in the critical category, six in <b>the</b> <b>threatened,</b> three in the watch, eight in the recovering and one in the study. Of seven goat breeds listed, two are in the critical category, two in the watch, two recovering and one in the study. Finally, there are 11 rabbit breeds listed on the CPL: three in the critical category, three threatened, and five in the watch.|$|E

5|$|Telopea oreades is {{not listed}} under Commonwealth {{environmental}} legislation {{and is not}} considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling.

Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the southeastern United States, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Vero Beach, Florida to Wilmington, North Carolina.

This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest fly fishing in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through Glacier National Park.

5|$|From the well-fortified {{position}} in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area.

40|$|A {{pastoral}} {{perspective on}} <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> {{loss of employment}} The changing employment situation in South Africa is currently characterized by the various challenges it poses to individuals in the workplace, such as affirmative action, voluntary severance packages and discharges. Discharges are often associated with employment insecurity and <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> loss of employment. A psychological approach to <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> loss of employment is on its own inadequate. The aim {{of this article is}} to investigate the possibilities of a holistic approach as part of pastoral support to persons experiencing the threat of losing their employment. It aims to argue that pastoral care can benefit from a multi- disciplinary approach to <b>the</b> <b>threatening</b> loss of employment. However, pastoral care needs guidelines to facilitate its relationship with psychology and to assist in dealing with faith in the counselling process. This article makes use of Gerkin’s model for pastoral care in order to provide some guidelines for pastoral care for individuals who are experiencing a protracted threat of loss of employment. Gerkin’s model will be brought into dialogue with a cognitive behavioural therapeutic model...|$|R
5|$|G. juniperina subsp. juniperina – is {{endemic to}} Western Sydney, {{restricted}} to clay soils from Blacktown west to Penrith and Marsden Park and north to Pitt Town.

They {{were able to}} bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E

5|$|The Catlins coast often hosts New Zealand {{fur seals}} and Hooker's sea lions, and {{occasionally}} southern elephant seals can be seen. Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho), as do other seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers {{are home to}} herons, stilts, godwits and oystercatchers. Bitterns and <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> fernbird (matata) can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the {{southern}} summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981.

5|$|The park's {{margins are}} habitat for <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> American crocodile. The {{construction}} {{of miles of}} cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.|$|E
5|$|The western {{third of}} Sicily fell {{relatively}} quickly into Muslim hands, but {{conquest of the}} eastern portion of the island was a protracted and haphazard affair. There is little evidence of large-scale campaigns or pitched battles, and warfare was dominated by repeated Arab attacks on Byzantine citadels, coupled with raids (sa'ifa) in the surrounding countryside, aimed at looting or the extraction of tribute and prisoners from <b>the</b> <b>threatened</b> localities. In this type of warfare, the south-eastern third of the island (Val di Noto) suffered comparatively more than the more mountainous and inaccessible north-eastern portion.|$|E
