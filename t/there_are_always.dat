5|$|Bone {{grafting}} {{is necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack of bone. While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E

25|$|To complicate matters, Halakha, {{speaking}} of the relative hour, states that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> 12 hours between the break of dawn and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{adiabatic}} {{potential energy}} surfaces (APES) are then obtained as the eigenvalues of this matrix. In the original paper {{it is proven}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> linear terms in the expansion. It follows that the degeneracy of the wave function cannot correspond to a stable structure.|$|E
25|$|Throughout each episode <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> {{a number}} of hidden jokes or cameos. You may see {{characters}} from previous sketches hiding in the background or a prop or product reused. For example, there was a sketch about South African Cola. Throughout the series you would see characters drinking this beverage in other sketches.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of the seal brings up the problem of leakage within the system. Since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a miniscule gap between two parts, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> the problem of leakage, however the system’s structure allows leakage to be controlled to a very precise level.|$|R

25|$|First of May — A term {{also used}} in the carnival, meaning a novice {{performer}} {{in his first season}} on a show. Shows used to leave winter quarters for their opening spot on the first of May, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> some new workers hired on the first of May who have never worked shows before.|$|E
25|$|Presently, {{there are}} several hundred Jewish {{families}} living in Tokyo, and {{a small number of}} Jewish families in and around Kobe. A small number of Jewish expatriates of other countries live throughout Japan, temporarily, for business, research, a gap year, or a variety of other purposes. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> Jewish members of the United States Armed Forces serving on Okinawa and in the other American military bases throughout Japan.|$|E

25|$|Eclipse seasons are {{the only}} times during a year eclipses can occur, due to the {{inclination}} of the Moon's orbit. Each season lasts for approximately 34 days and repeats just short of six months, thus <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> two full eclipse seasons each year. Two to three eclipses always occur in each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon is low, hence the Sun, Moon and Earth become close enough in alignment (syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.|$|E
25|$|Gumillea {{has also}} been called a synonym of Picramnia, but the {{ultimate}} source of this information is obscure {{and it is not}} mentioned in either of the recent treatments of Picramnia. It is worth noting that on their plate for Gumillea, Ruiz and Pavón showed 11 ovules or immature seeds that had been extracted from a 2-locular ovary. But the ovary in Picramnia has (sometimes 2), usually 3 to 4 locules and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> two ovules in each locule.|$|E
25|$|Most {{studies in}} {{neurology}} have too few test subjects to be scientifically sure. Those insufficient size studies {{are the basis}} for all domain-specific diagnoses in neuropsychiatry, since the few large enough studies <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> find individuals with the brain changes thought {{to be associated with}} a mental condition but without any of the symptoms. The only diagnoses that can be validated through large enough brain studies are those on serious brain damages and neurodegenerative diseases that destroy most of the brain.|$|E

25|$|The various specializations of the {{cylindric}} equal-area projection differ only in {{the ratio}} of the vertical to horizontal axis. This ratio determines the standard parallel of the projection, which is the parallel at which there is no distortion and along which distances match the stated scale. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> two standard parallels on the cylindric equal-area projection, each at the same distance north and south of the equator. The standard parallels of the Gall–Peters are 45°N and 45°S. Several other specializations of the equal-area cylindric have been described, promoted, or otherwise named.|$|E
25|$|Finally, an {{individual}} strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand {{on one side}} and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be careful in concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.|$|E
25|$|These four {{assumptions}} are seldom all true: <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> imperfections on the surface, adsorbed molecules {{are not necessarily}} inert, and the mechanism is clearly not {{the same for the}} very first molecules to adsorb to a surface as for the last. The fourth condition is the most troublesome, as frequently more molecules will adsorb to the monolayer; this problem is addressed by the BET isotherm for relatively flat (non-microporous) surfaces. The Langmuir isotherm is nonetheless the first choice for most models of adsorption, and has many applications in surface kinetics (usually called Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics) and thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Within each classification, the UIL {{separates}} {{the schools in}} regions, and then further {{separates the}} regions into districts for various contests. The districts are numbered from 1 (in far west Texas) to 32 (in south Texas). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> 32 districts in Class AAAAAA and Class AAAAA, but the smaller classifications may have numbers skipped {{based on the number}} of schools in the classification. No more than 10 schools are permitted in a single district unless all schools and the UIL consent otherwise; the preference is for an even number of schools in each district (6, 8, 10) though in some cases travel issues may prevent such.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporaneous}} musical {{fashion of}} the outer world has ever found its echo {{within the walls of}} the synagogue, so that in the superstructure added by successive generations of transmitting singers <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> discernible points of comparison, even of contact, with the style and structure of each successive era in the musical history of other religious communions. Attention has frequently been drawn to the resemblances in manner and even in some points of detail between the chants of the muezzin and of the reader of the Qur'an with much of the hazzanut, not alone of the Sephardim, who passed so many centuries in Arab lands, but also of the Ashkenazim, equally long located far away in northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|A third type of conjectures {{concerns}} {{aspects of}} the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the formn2+1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n+1)2 for every positive integern. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.|$|E
