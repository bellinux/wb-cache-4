Unlike the genomes of most organisms (including humans, animals, plants, and bacteria) which {{are made up of}} double-stranded DNA, many viral genomes are made up of a different, single-stranded nucleic acid called RNA. Unusually for a virus, though, the influenza type A virus genome is not a single piece of RNA; instead, it consists of segmented pieces of negative-sense RNA, each piece containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product (protein). The term negative-sense RNA just implies that the RNA genome cannot be translated into protein directly; it must first be transcribed to positive-sense RNA before it can be translated into protein products. The segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2012, Major League Baseball and ESPN {{agreed to}} an eight-year, $5.6 billion {{contract}} extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gave ESPN the rights to up to 90 regular-season games, alternating rights {{to one of the}} two Wild Card games (between American League and National League teams) each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games. On September 19, 2012, Sports Business Daily reported that the league would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. On October 2, 2012, the new deal between Major League Baseball and TBS was officially confirmed; NBC looked to be left without a package, because though it made an offer, Major League Baseball did not consider NBC a serious bidder after the ESPN deal was made public. Sources said that NBC did not make a strong offer, and that it was most interested in ESPN's package, which includes exclusivity on Sunday night and rights to the two mid-week games. When ESPN took <b>that</b> <b>package,</b> NBC's interest waned.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of {{affecting}} the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes {{to express themselves}} differently. DNA {{in the human body}} is wrapped around histones, which are proteins <b>that</b> <b>package</b> and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with chemical tags known as the epigenome, which shapes the physical structure of the genome. It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments.|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how packaging of convenience goods is an integrated part of the international new product development process. We have chosen a qualitative approach. The study was conducted through in-depth interviews, face-to-face and by phone. The interviewees were selected through judgemental sampling. The sample included eight organi-zations producing convenience goods that are active on several markets. It was found <b>that</b> <b>packaging</b> always has been of importance; however, it was found <b>that</b> <b>packaging</b> has increased in importance within concept development implying <b>that</b> <b>packaging</b> indirectly has increased in importance within the new product development process. Further, packaging is included in all stages in the process, but has its ma-jor significance in the concept development phase.
