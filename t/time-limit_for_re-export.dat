40|$|Estimating {{the price}} {{elasticity}} of China’s imports {{is difficult because}} many imports are used to produce exports and because the {{real effective exchange rate}} has remained fairly stable. To circumvent the first problem, we control <b>for</b> <b>re-exports,</b> and to increase the discriminatory power of the tests, we employ a panel data set including imports from 25 countries. The results indicate that a 10 percent RMB appreciation would increase imports for processing and ordinary imports by three to four percent.

Thus, a renminbi appreciation should help to raise China’s imports and rebalance its economy. JEL classification: F 32, F 4...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to refine the construction of the effective exchange rates (EERs) for Asian economies, to make allowances for the role of Hong Kong SAR as an entrepôt and to reflect the fast-growing intra-regional trade. For the scenarios under consideration, it turns out that adjusting <b>for</b> <b>re-export</b> trade through Hong Kong SAR is generally more important in the determination of trade weights than updating the base year. The proposed refinements have important policy implications, particularly in estimating the relative sizes of currency blocs, should the region 2 ̆ 7 s exchange rate policies become more oriented to trade baskets than to bilateral dollar rates...|$|R

Re-exports occur when imports to Hong Kong are consigned to a buyer in Hong Kong, who adds a markup, and exports the goods elsewhere without fundamentally changing the goods. Using U.

Illegal trade such as smuggling and tariff evasion also affect China's trade with her other trading partners. ...|$|R
