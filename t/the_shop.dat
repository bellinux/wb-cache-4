5|$|Gunter's Tea Shop was {{established}} in 1757 at Nos.7–8 Berkeley Square by the Italian Domenico Negri. Robert Gunter took co-ownership of <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> in 1777, and full ownership in 1799. During the 19th century it became a fashionable place to buy cakes and ice cream, and was well known for its range of multi-tiered wedding cakes. <b>The</b> <b>shop</b> moved to Curzon Street in 1936 when {{the eastern side of}} Berkley Square was demolished. It closed in 1956, with the catering business surviving until 1976.|$|E

40|$|Reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> {{center is}} very {{complicated}} and challenging process. Reasons for the reconstruction may be different.

5|$|Delightful Dolly is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Marie Allen, an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather, who sees a large doll {{in the window of}} <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> At night, she sneaks out to visit <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> with the doll, but finds it gone. She sneaks into <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> and ends up hiding in the box, to prevent from being discovered by the store clerk. She is taken to the home of the rich little girl, Daisy. After taking the doll's clothes, Marie hides in the box as Daisy approaches. When Daisy opens the box, Marie acts like a doll. When Daisy takes a break for food, Marie secretly takes the food and drink much to Daisy's bewilderment. Marie's grandfather arrives at the home and explains the situation and Marie receives the doll from the family. Little is known about the production or cast of the film, but Marie Eline played the role of Marie. The film was released on October 14, 1910 and was met with some praise in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and {{the same year that}} the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies that were at the time the largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
