5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> power and type-B receptacles on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire.

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

5|$|In later life, Morshead {{turned down}} various offers of {{military}} and diplomatic posts, {{as well as the}} governorship of Queensland. He did serve as president of the Boy Scouts Association of New South Wales and the Big Brother Movement, a British youth emigration support scheme, and was a trustee of the Gowrie scholarship trust fund, which provided assistance to the descendants of Second World War veterans. In 1957 he was appointed chairman of a committee which reviewed the group of departments concerned with defence. The Menzies government accepted the committee's recommendation <b>that</b> <b>Supply</b> and Defence Production be amalgamated, but dropped the key proposal that the Department of Defence absorb the Departments of Army, Navy and Air. This reform was finally carried out by the Whitlam government in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason why {{it was able to}} play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E
5|$|The Crystarium is a {{leveling}} system {{consisting of}} six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Each crystal in the Crystarium {{represents one of}} the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is not available to the player {{at the beginning of the}} game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.|$|E

The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians {{had never been able}} entirely to repress {{after the end of the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September Bostock {{gained the}} {{agreement}} of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No.80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI {{as part of a}} redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA. While this raised morale within No.80 Wing, it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas. On 8November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit he observed that it was likely <b>that</b> <b>supply</b> shortages would impede the wing's operations. No.80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9December and No.452 Squadron departed on 15December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea on 15December. As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic, and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.|$|E
