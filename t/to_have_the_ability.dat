5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E

50|$|Baraka {{is not a}} state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It {{flows from}} God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have {{received}} baraka are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> perform miracles (karamat), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead. However, according to Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri, a prominent Sufi mystic, {{the use of these}} miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.|$|R
5|$|Polyploidy appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{enhanced}} <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{of flowering}} plants {{to survive the}} extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|R

25|$|A nat is {{a spirit}} or god who resembles a human in shape that often {{maintains}} or guards objects. When people die, {{they can become}} nats. Those who become nats often have a gruesome violent death which explains their vengeful nature. Nats also are believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to possess animals, such as tigers or alligators. These spirits {{can also be found}} in nature in things such as trees and rocks. The majority of these nats are viewed as troublesome and irritable. They require calming, food and offerings.|$|E
25|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by eosinophil-induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 helper T cell (Th2). By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme {{it may be possible}} to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma.|$|E

50|$|By about 1850 {{steam engine}} {{technology}} <b>had</b> advanced <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce locomotives with sufficient power to move freight, including bulk goods such as coal and grain, so railroads {{had already begun}} displacing canals as the preferred method of long-distance transportation, as they also offered speed. In 1852, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) began offering rail service from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, and in 1857, it bought the Main Line Canal from the state. In 1859, all canals owned by the commonwealth were sold. The PRR formed the Pennsylvania Canal Company in 1867 and continued to use canals to haul freight. However, the canal business declined steadily {{in the last quarter}} of the century, and most Pennsylvania canals no longer functioned after 1900.|$|R

25|$|A TEM {{stage is}} {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to hold a}} specimen and be manipulated to bring the region of interest {{into the path of}} the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several μm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers. Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using screw gearing in concert with stepper motors, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a joystick or trackball.|$|E
25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to {{throttle}} down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage {{was designed to be}} powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology {{have made it possible}} for the av-erage person to acquire thousands of high resolution digital pho-tographs per year. While there are clear advantages <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> amass such large collections it creates new problems when trying to organize, browse and generally interact with the photos. In this paper we introduce the concept of a Photo Collage Tree, a structure which automatically organizes such large photo collec-tions, and summarizes the collection as a tree of photo collages. With a photo collage tree, a user can browse through a large photo collection, and access all the photos through some traversal of the tree. We present an implementation of a photo browsing tool based on the collage tree concept. 1...|$|R

Devices range from having basic components and performing fundamental language functions <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform computer-like functions and control household appliances. AAC devices are designed to be used as supplementary modes of communication for existing communication strategies and can be configured or customized to address most communication needs.
