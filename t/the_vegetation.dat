40|$|The role {{of blood}} monocytes in the {{attachment}} of streptococci to endocardial vegetations {{was investigated in}} an experimental Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis by depletion of blood monocytes with the cytostatic drug VP 16 - 213 alone and combined with anticoagulant treatment with warfarin sodium.

40|$|Abstract.

40|$|A {{main feature}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of bacterial endocarditis is the activation of the coagulation system via the extrinsic pathway, resulting {{in the formation of}} infected endocardial vegetations. Earlier studies gave indirect evidence that monocytes {{play an important role in}} the procoagulant response during the course of the disease. In this study, we assessed the role of monocytes more directly. We compared weights and tissue factor activities (TFA) of endocardial vegetations of normal rabbits infected with Streptococcus sanguis with those of rabbits which were treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide (Vepesid; Bristol-Myers Squibb B. V.) to induce a selective monocytopenia. Furthermore, the importance of the presence of bacteria was determined through the influence of antibiotic treatment on TFA, vegetational weight, and infection of <b>the</b> <b>vegetations.</b> <b>The</b> TFA of <b>the</b> <b>vegetations</b> was measured chromogenically by monitoring the factor VII-dependent activation of factor X with an amidolytic assay for factor Xa. We found that the degree of infection and <b>the</b> weight of <b>vegetations</b> of rabbits treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide did not differ from that of untreated rabbits. Their TFA, however, was significantly lower than <b>the</b> TFA of <b>vegetations</b> of rabbits not treated with etoposide. We also found that, as with the monocytopenic rabbits, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>vegetations</b> was not reduced in penicillin G-treated rabbits. The degree of infection and TFA, however, were significantly lower. We conclude that monocytes indeed are involved in the activation of the coagulation system during the course of bacterial endocarditis and that the degree of infection is positively correlated to the TFA of <b>the</b> <b>vegetations...</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, <b>the</b> <b>{{vegetation}}</b> on {{the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very thick and has resulted in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged <b>the</b> <b>{{vegetation}}</b> {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. <b>The</b> <b>vegetation</b> structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed.

40|$|The {{natural history}} and {{treatment}} of experimental endocarditis due to heterogeneous and homogeneous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or vancomycin were administered for 3 days via a computerized pump to mimic human drug kinetics in animals. After challenge with the minimum inoculum producing 90 % of infections (ID 90), bacteria in <b>the</b> <b>vegetations</b> grew logarithmically for 16 h. Then, bacterial densities stabilized (at ∼ 108 cfu/g) and growth rates sharply declined. Both regimens cured ⩾ 60 % of endocarditis (due to heterogeneous or homogeneous bacteria) when started 12 - 16 h after infection, although the bacterial densities in <b>the</b> <b>vegetations</b> had increased by 20 times in between. In contrast, treatment started after 24 h failed in most animals, while bacterial densities had not increased any more.
