Youngblood had entered school at 195 pounds and put on 10 pounds a year through weight-lifting, finishing around 245 pounds. Youngblood and his teammates {{were part of the}} testing for what became Gatorade, a beverage created by doctors Robert Cade and Dana Shires, designed to help Gator athletes who had to practice and play in Central Florida heat. Said Youngblood, [...] "Dr. Cade began experimenting with Gatorade my freshman year. He tried <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all! That first stuff was lethal! It was thick, like syrup, and had an aftertaste. Then, it started to look like milk." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 1993, Petterson {{was asked}} by {{officials}} in the Clinton administration to deliver a [...] ultimatum to Sudan's Islamist leader, Hasan al-Turabi, and the country's president, Omar al-Bashir. The document contained a brief list of talking points that were designed to warn Sudan's top government officials about any involvement in alleged plots <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>U.S.</b> diplomats working in Sudan. The alleged threats were based on evidence gathered by a foreign agent retained by the C.I.A., data which {{would be used to}} justify Petterson's reduction of American embassy personnel in Khartoum. The agent's information would later be found to have been fabricated, and would force the C.I.A. to redact or delete up to 100 reports on Sudan. Petterson would later state that he did not believe the intelligence findings warranted a draw down in embassy staff.|$|E
500|$|... "Jump the Shark" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz; it was {{directed}} by Cliff Bole. The episode proved difficult to make. After the cancellation of The Lone Gunmen television series, which aired in 2001, Fox reportedly [...] "hated [...] characters". Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz {{that they did not}} want to bring the characters back in any capacity in the ninth season. Actor Bruce Harwood later explained that [...] "I think if the studio objected to anything, it was wasting time on our characters long enough <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> off." [...] Co-writer Gilligan later recalled [...] "The Lone Gunmen was still kind of an open wound for me." [...] Thus, the episode was crafted as a way to wrap up the series. Due to the nature of the episode—which effectively works as a tie-in—various long-term characters from both The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen make cameo appearances.|$|E
500|$|Like Berardinelli, USA Todays Mike Clark thought Bale {{performed}} {{the role of}} Batman {{as well as he}} did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was [...] "frustratingly underdeveloped". Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited [...] "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, [...] "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; Serpico New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all at once rather than one by one." [...] In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of [...] "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in [...] "emotional complexity" [...] where the rest of the movie failed.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{set to be}} {{filmed in}} Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so {{the bulk of the}} film was shot in the Philippines. Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, [...] "It wasn't really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen. I mean, if they meant <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us,</b> why send a note?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{application}} process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke {{out after the}} ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had {{become aware of the}} plans only after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: [...] "Everybody knows they are trying <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us.</b> People are really concerned about this.

2500|$|The Moriori, of the Chatham Islands, practiced pacifism {{by order}} of their {{ancestor}} Nunuku-whenua. This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. In turn, this led to their almost complete annihilation in 1835 by invading Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama Māori from the Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. The invading Māori killed, enslaved and cannibalised the Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled : [...] " [...] commenced <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> like sheep... were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed - men, women and children indiscriminately." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ron Paul {{was also}} {{challenged}} for his stance on Iran, and was criticized by Michele Bachmann, who Paul refuted {{by continuing to}} state his position that sanctions are an act of war, {{and the prospect of}} Iran possibly having a nuclear weapon is similar to the war propaganda that preceded the war in Iraq. Paul continued, [...] "I don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. I would like to reduce them because there would be less chance of war. But to declare war on 1.2 billion Muslims and say all Muslims are the same, this is dangerous talk. Yeah, there are some radicals. But they don't come here <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> because we're free and prosperous. Do they go to Switzerland and Sweden? That is absurd." ...|$|E

[...] A Moriori survivor recalled: [...] " [...] commenced <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> like sheep.... were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies.

2500|$|Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama in turn saw {{the meeting}} as a {{precursor}} to warfare {{on the part of}} Moriori and responded.

2500|$|Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D, IL), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, {{who called}} for the {{investigation}}, stated that the investigation was intended to address CIA failures to inform Congress fully or accurately about four issues: C.I.A. involvement in the downing of a missionary plane mistaken for a narcotics flight in Peru in 2001, and two [...] "matters that remain classified", {{as well as the}} rumored-assassinations question. In addition, the inquiry is likely to look at the Bush administration's program of eavesdropping without warrants and its detention and interrogation program. U.S. Intelligence Chief Dennis Blair testified before the House Intelligence Committee on February 3, 2010, that the U.S. intelligence community is prepared <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizens if they threaten other Americans or the United States.

2500|$|Within {{one second}} of each other, President Kennedy, Governor Connally, and Mrs. Kennedy all turned {{abruptly}} from looking to their left to looking to their right, between Zapruder film frames 155 and 169.

Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then he turned his head and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not see the President, so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired.
