5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 What {{explains}} variation over <b>the</b> issues <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> examine over time? Adopting an interbranch approach, I {{argue that}} this variation {{is a function of}} changes in rules of access. Rules of access govern whether litigants can use <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> and are set by both lawmakers and judges. I focus on two rules of access - jurisdiction and standing. During the legislative process, lawmakers decide how to grant policy-making authority to <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> through rules of access. Open access encourages litigants to use <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> These decisions create statutory environments that shape <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> courts' agendas. I examine how Congress varies jurisdiction and standing. Using original data of Public Laws that grant jurisdiction to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> district <b>courts</b> and Public Laws that confer standing on potential litigants, I explain how rules of access for <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> have changed over time and across policy issues. I present a theory that links changes in rules of access to the courts' agendas in that Congress makes antecedent decisions that influence which issues are presented to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to demonstrate the relationship between rules of access and judicial agendas...|$|R

5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful.

5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
40|$|I am {{honored to}} write the {{foreword}} to {{this issue of the}} University of Richmond Law Review dedicated to 2 ̆ 2 <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Courts.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The editors have asked me to address the question of the role of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> judiciary today. No issue is more pressing within <b>federal</b> judicial circles. <b>The</b> Congress has, in the last few years, enacted several jurisdictional statutes, some that expand and others that limit the authority of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> thereby raising questions about congressional powers over <b>federal</b> jurisdiction. <b>The</b> shape of the appellate structure of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> is now under review pursuant to the congressionally-chartered Commission on Structural Alternatives for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Courts</b> of Appeals. <b>The</b> Executive and the Senate have been engaged in struggles over the nomination of individual judges, and the American Bar Association has recently reported its concern about attacks on the independence of the judiciary.
