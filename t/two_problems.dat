5|$|In the Journal des Sçavans 1685 (26.VIII), p.314 {{there appear}} <b>two</b> <b>problems</b> {{concerning}} the probability each of two players may have of winning {{in a game}} of dice. Solutions were published in the Acta Eruditorum 1690 (May), pp.219–223 in the article Quaestiones nonnullae de usuris, cum solutione Problematis de Sorte Alearum. In addition, Leibniz himself published a solution in the same journal on pages 387-390.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had <b>two</b> <b>problems,</b> {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented <b>two</b> <b>problems.</b> The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>two</b> <b>problem</b> {{classes that}} are important to researchers as well as practitioners, namely packing and project scheduling <b>problems.</b> First, the <b>two</b> <b>problem</b> categories are described. This includes a classification of packing problems as well as of project scheduling concepts. While both problem classes are different with respect to their fields of application, similarities of their mathematical structures are examined. It is shown that all packing problems considered here are special cases of models for project scheduling. The aim is to indicate which project scheduling models can be used to capture the different types of packing problems. Finally, some implications for research on optimization algorithms for these <b>two</b> <b>problem</b> classes are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, <b>two</b> <b>problems</b> arose for the project. The {{first was}} geopolitical in nature: the main {{spacecraft}} control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
5|$|Ceolnoth (died 870) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of Canterbury. Although later chroniclers stated he had {{previously}} held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury, there is no contemporary evidence of this, and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833. Ceolnoth faced <b>two</b> <b>problems</b> as archbishop– raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during {{the early part of}} his archiepiscopate. Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838. Ceolnoth's later years in office were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric.|$|E

That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience <b>two</b> <b>problems</b> at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

5|$|On day <b>two,</b> <b>problems</b> in Arnhem forced Hicks {{to change}} the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge—strong German defences had halted the other battalions so Hicks decided that the Staffords would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective. However, the Staffords also failed to break through the German defenders. Bad weather over England kept the planned second lift on the ground. The first troops did not arrive until 15:00, a delay that gave the Germans time to {{approach}} the landing grounds and engage the KOSB in numerous probing attacks on the northern perimeter. At one stage KOSB commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Payton-Reid led a bayonet charge to clear the Germans from the area. Meanwhile, the Borders were repeatedly attacked from the south of landing zone's 'X' and 'Z', and were eventually forced to call on the 75mm guns of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment to break up the attacks. Hicks had previously decided to send the Staffords on the second lift to join their battalion fighting in Arnhem, while he also sent the 11th Parachute Battalion on the same lift to support 1st Parachute Brigade. The KOSB, until then responsible for defending the landing ground, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace the 11th Parachute Battalion. However they were still responsible for defending landing ground 'L', for the arrival of the Poles gliders on day three. This left only the Borders, No. 2 Wing GPR and the field ambulance under brigade command.|$|E

Occupational exposure to silica, pesticides, and mercury can also worsen the disease.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to generating retrieval and transfer of structured knowledge is presented.

25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>problems</b> ensue {{from the}} {{multiplicity}} of transcription systems used for Tlingit.

The second problem is that most transcriptions made before Franz Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus it is important to check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.|$|E
