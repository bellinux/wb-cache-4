5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. <b>The</b> <b>operators</b> collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|When a call is received, a jack lamp {{lights on}} the back panel and <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> {{responds}} by placing the rear cord into the corresponding jack and throwing the front key forward. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> then converses with the caller, who informs <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> to whom {{he or she would}} like to speak. If it is another extension, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> places <b>the</b> front cord in the associated jack and pulls the front key backwards to ring the called party. After connecting, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> leaves both cords [...] "up" [...] with the keys in the normal position so the parties can converse.

5|$|The Chief Executive of the Rockingham Motor Speedway David Grace apologised for {{the delay}} in the event's {{schedule}} but denied that the drainage problem had been anticipated.

Carpentier was vocal in his criticism of the organisation of the track, saying that the track personnel should have been ready a month before the race was held, while Kanaan admitted that he was concerned, feeling that the situation was not good for everyone. The 15,000 spectators who were in attendance on Thursday were issued cash refunds.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{was in fact}} a {{mechanical}} illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel. The chess masters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{market is}} split into {{manufacturers}}, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors—who handle {{several types of}} electronic machines—who in turn sell them to <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 {{just over a year}} old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. Kee did have its own manufacturing equipment and therefore the ability to develop original titles, however, and after several clone games lead engineer Steve Bristow developed the idea for a new title. Bristow, who had previously worked with the Atari founders on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, {{came up with the idea}} while thinking of how he could improve Computer Space. His idea to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game were to replace its difficult to control rocket ships with more straightforward tanks, and to make it a two-player game instead of a single-player one.|$|E

5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
