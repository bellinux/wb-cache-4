40|$|A {{large number}} of economic, financial, social, technological, {{ecological}} – environmental and other indicators define the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> According {{to some of the}} indicators, the alternative investment project is suitable for putting it into practice, according to others, it is not. Therefore, while evaluating <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> (e. g. the projects which are financed by EU structural funds) it becomes difficult to choose the most effective projects whose realization would bring the most significant benefit to the economy subject and to our country. It is possible to get objective answers about the effectiveness of the alternative investment projects by evaluating them according to multicriterial methods. With the help of such methods it is possible to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> comprehensively by presenting one generalized indicator. It shows the effectiveness of the alternative project fairly objectively. The multicriterial evaluation method analyzed in the article gave the possibility {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the projects chosen, and to set the priority level of these projects. From the analysis carried out, it is obvious that three investment projects are suitable for being financed and put into practice, and the remaining ones have to be rejected or corrected. The method for evaluating the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> proposed by the authors has both theoretical and practical advantages (the extensive analysis can be carried out, the different classification of the evaluation criteria is possible, the weight of the criteria is evaluated (importance, significance), the possibility to include the new evaluation criteria and their employment in practice (in the field of investment analysis) is considered.
