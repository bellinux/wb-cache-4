Aviation {{was a part of}} the {{brothers}}' lives from a very early age; Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that when he was a baby, the only way his mother could get him to stop crying at times was to bring him to an airport and park the car at the end of the runway so he could watch airplanes. The brothers constantly built model airplanes as infants and Dale was known to repeatedly pester their father into letting them build real ones. When Dale reached the age of 15, he learned to fly in a Cessna 140 before learning <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> <b>car.</b> While still in high school, Alan joined the Civil Air Patrol at age 17 as a way of getting cheaper flying lessons.

According to his posthumous biographer Raymond Wilson, Jenner was anti-authoritarian as a boy and, {{at the age of}} twelve, during World War I, he was sent to work aboard a {{training}} ship for misbehaving boys. When he was fourteen, the ship sailed from Southampton to Cape Town, South Africa. On the way, while the ship was docked at a port in West Africa, a tsetse fly bit Jenner and infected him with Trypanosoma; he therefore contracted African trypanosomiasis, which is also called [...] "sleeping sickness". He subsequently entered a 15-day coma, but eventually recovered.

500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} many roles, incarnations, and identities {{throughout}} her books {{to illustrate how}} oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her [...] "Mary". [...] Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the [...] "hellish horror of being 'called out of [...] name'". [...] Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right. Another incident {{in the book that}} solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally [...] "in control of her fate". [...] This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.|$|E
