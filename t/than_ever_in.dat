5|$|After his divorce, Vainio's life slowly {{began to}} change. Creatively he was more {{prolific}} <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s and 1980s. He began composing in addition to writing lyrics. He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo, and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> <b>In</b> February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not {{to speak of}} elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> the care of Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E

Summer 2006 saw the release of the first Corwood DVD, a video version of Glasgow Sunday, Jandek's first live performance.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Spotswood became acting royal {{governor}} of Virginia in 1710, {{by which time}} pressure on the colony to expand had become more acute <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> <b>In</b> 1716, Governor Spotswood, with about 50 other men and 74 horses, led a real estate speculation expedition up the Rappahannock River valley during westward exploration of the interior of Virginia. The journalist of this expedition was a Huguenot, Lieut. John Fontaine, who served as {{an officer in the}} British Army.|$|E
25|$|Around 1890 Colonel Lilly {{turned over}} the day-to-day {{management}} of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> <b>In</b> 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over {{the next few years}} the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.|$|E

The already storied athletic program rose to dominance, winning state championships in Basketball, Football, Ice Hockey and Wrestling. In more recent history, the campus has been expanded to include modern facilities that support science, technology, performing arts and continued athletic success. The combination of the school's rich history, generous alumni and popular staff has built a promising future for Mount Carmel.|$|E
25|$|Hasheesh {{is indeed}} an accursed drug, {{and the soul}} at last pays a most bitter price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of {{it is not the}} proper means of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation I did not know things as they are more truly <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> the {{ordinary}} state?....

25|$|In Veytaux, his {{literary}} output was greater <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> <b>In</b> 1860, he published a unique volume, partly reflecting {{the style of}} Ahasverus, and entitled Merlin l'enchanteur (Merlin the Enchanter); in 1862, a Histoire de la campagne de 1815 ("History of the Campaign of 1815"), in 1865 an elaborate book on the French Revolution, in which the author depicts atrocities carried out by revolutionary forces (causing his rejection by many other partisans of republican ideas). Many pamphlets date from this period, as does La Création (1870), a third book of the genre of Ahasverus and Merlin, but even vaguer - dealing with physical science rather than history, legend, or philosophy for the most part.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt {{followed}} this by {{many years as}} a literary, art, and theatre critic, at which he enjoyed some success. He was subsequently beset by numerous personal problems, including a failed marriage, illness, insolvency, a disastrous love entanglement {{that led to a}} mental breakdown, and scurrilous attacks by political conservatives, many of them fueled by his indiscreet publication of Liber Amoris, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his love affair. English society was becoming increasingly prudish, the ensuing scandal effectively destroyed his reputation, and he found it harder than ever to earn a living. He married a second time. Consequently, more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> need of money, he was forced to churn out article after article for the periodical press.|$|E
25|$|As {{the head}} of a family, Hazlitt was now more <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> need of money. Through William Godwin, with whom he was {{frequently}} in touch, he obtained a commission to write an English grammar, published on 11 November 1809 as A New and Improved Grammar of the English Tongue. Another project that came his way was the work that was published as Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft, a compilation of autobiographical writing by the recently deceased playwright, novelist, and radical political activist, together with additional material by Hazlitt himself. Though completed in 1810, this work did not {{see the light of day}} until 1816, and so provided no financial gain to satisfy the needs of a young husband and father. Hazlitt in the meantime had not forsaken his painterly ambitions. His environs at Winterslow afforded him opportunities for landscape painting, and he spent considerable time in London procuring commissions for portraits.|$|E
500|$|David Robinson, {{writing in}} The Times bemoaned {{the fact that}} the [...] "dramatic bits between the set pieces don't count for much."

[...] The Democratic party would be all but non-existent in the Bay State for roughly ten years due to their earlier anti-war platform.

Watch out ladies..." [...] Virgin Media also ran a feature profiling their twenty-five most memorable television comebacks, amongst them was Paul's 2004 return and they said [...] "ruthless 'workaholic' businessman Paul Robinson fled Australia in 1993 to escape fraud charges only to return more sinister <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>in</b> 2005 to burn down the Lassiter's hotel complex." ...|$|E
500|$|Tatiana's English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, {{recalled}} that Tatiana had grown razor thin in captivity and seemed [...] "haughtier" [...] and more inscrutable to him <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> <b>In</b> April 1918 the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria to Yekaterinburg. The remaining children remained behind in Tobolsk because Alexei, {{who had suffered}} another attack of haemophilia, could not be moved. It was Tatiana who persuaded her mother to [...] "stop tormenting herself" [...] and {{make a decision to}} go with her father and leave Alexei behind. Alexandra decided that level-headed Tatiana must be left behind to manage the household and look after Alexei.|$|E
