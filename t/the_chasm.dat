5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into <b>the</b> <b>chasm.</b> Ruth, who had not noticed <b>the</b> <b>chasm,</b> slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Icarus– The son of Daedalus, who {{had become}} insane and obsessed with finding the Sisters of Fate. Kratos {{encountered}} Icarus by the Great Chasm and attacked him. The two battled while falling down <b>the</b> <b>chasm.</b> Kratos eventually stripped Icarus of his wings, took them, and allowed Icarus to fall to his death into the Underworld. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. <b>The</b> <b>chasm</b> between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{most ancient}} {{recorded}} name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on <b>the</b> <b>chasm),</b> {{which is consistent}} with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals. These crystals are protected and venerated by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a worldwide religious order. One day, the crystals are consumed by darkness, throwing the world into chaos. Agnès Oblige, Vestal of the Wind Crystal, escapes {{while the rest of the}} temple's worshipers perish to protect her. At the same time, a great chasm opens up beneath the village of Norende; Tiz Arrior, a shepherd of the village, is the only survivor. When he returns to <b>the</b> <b>chasm</b> hoping to find other survivors, he meets Agnès and her fairy companion Airy. The three are then attacked by forces from the hostile Duchy of Eternia, who seek to prevent Agnès from awakening the crystals. After defeating the soldiers, Tiz decides to travel with Agnès as her protector. They return to Caldisla, where they are also joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac vagabond who holds a book predicting future events, and Edea Lee, an Eternian soldier who becomes disillusioned and defects after her commanding officer commits war crimes. The party travels to the four temples, and Agnès awakens each of the crystals from darkness while being confronted by the forces of Eternia. During their journey, the group is aided by the ancient Sage Yulyana and observed by the immortal Lord DeRosso. The party eventually reaches Eternia, the home of the Earth Crystal, and are forced to defeat the leader of Eternia, Edea's father Braev Lee in battle. A column of light then appears in <b>the</b> <b>chasm,</b> which Airy says can be used to heal it. However, Airy's ritual instead sends them into a parallel world.|$|E
5|$|Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite {{utilized}} many of Connery's comic suggestions. It {{included the}} prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas {{had to convince}} Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun, which was about a young boy. Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had {{the idea of making}} Indiana a Boy Scout. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into <b>the</b> <b>chasm</b> while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by the massive statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan army. The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located {{at the edge of}} the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of <b>the</b> <b>Chasm</b> is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E

25|$|With the 1874 {{establishment}} {{of the community of}} the Indiana Colony, the new residents built their homes along today's Orange Grove Boulevard, the major north-south avenue paralleling the Arroyo on the east. However, the deep and seasonally flooded Arroyo presented a barrier to easy travel and transportation between renamed Pasadena and Los Angeles.

25|$|The group {{travels to}} the Bridge of Death, where each knight must answer three {{questions}} from the bridge-keeper before proceeding. Lancelot easily answers his questions and crosses the bridge. Robin is confounded by a difficult question, while Galahad gives a wrong answer to an easy one; both are hurled into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Arthur responds to the bridge-keeper's question with a question, and the bridge-keeper is thrown into <b>the</b> <b>chasm</b> for not knowing the answer.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Egypt {{at the end}} of its New Kingdom {{period is}} {{experiencing}} adversities. The deserts are eroding Egypt's arable land. The country's population has declined from eight to six million. Foreign peoples are entering Egypt in ever-growing numbers, undermining its unity. <b>The</b> <b>chasm</b> between the peasants and craftsmen on one hand, and the ruling classes on the other, is growing, exacerbated by the ruling elites' fondness for luxury and idleness. The country is becoming ever more deeply indebted to Phoenician merchants, as imported goods destroy native industries.|$|E
25|$|Over time, the mages became {{filled with}} hubris, and began {{fighting}} over {{how best to}} lead the world. The battle separated the Earth into the Fallen World and the Supernal Realm, with <b>the</b> <b>chasm</b> of the Abyss in between. The Fallen World is the world where humanity now exists, and the Supernal realm is the realm of magic, where the victorious mages of long ago now reside. The Abyss that separates the two worlds prevents most of humanity from awakening to magic, and hampers the power of mages trapped in the Fallen World.|$|E
25|$|In Flight {{from the}} Dark, Lone Wolf reaches the King in Holmgard who then dispatches him to Durenor {{to recover the}} Sommerswerd in Fire on the Water, and {{returning}} to defeat Archlord Zagarna, leader of the Darklords.

In <b>The</b> <b>Chasm</b> of Doom, Lone Wolf thwarts {{the resurrection of the}} first and most powerful Darklord, Vashna. At the end of the series, in Shadow on the Sand, Lone Wolf recovers the Book of the Magnakai, the ancient text which contains the higher lore of the Kai Lords through an encounter with Haakon, the new leader of the Darklords. With the massacre of the Kai, and Lone Wolf only an initiate, these teachings were thought to be lost.|$|E
