50|$|In addition, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers</b> {{can carry}} the genetic disease canine {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinosis, called Batten disease in humans. The first {{symptom of the}} disease is night blindness. Blindness and neurological signs such as epilepsy, motor abnormalities, dementia, and unexpected aggression will follow some years later. The gene responsible for the disease in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers</b> was identified in 2009 and {{there is now a}} DNA test for it. A German study showed that about 1/3 of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers</b> are carriers, but no affected dogs has been produced since the introduction of the DNA test as the German breed club requirements forbid carriers from being bred together.|$|R

50|$|All colours are permissible, barring {{liver and}} chocolate, and none is preferred.

50|$|Suitable for {{apartment}} living, the Tibetan is {{an energetic}} and surprisingly strong dog, and needs regular exercise. The energy {{level of the}} Tibetan is moderate to high and its general nature is happy, active, lively, intelligent, and agile. As a result, they are well suited for dog sports such as agility. They are steadfast, determined, and clever, {{which can lead to}} them being stubborn. <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers</b> are usually charming and loyal. Some dogs of this breed can often be guarding of their resources, which can make it hard to live with another pet.|$|R
40|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) in dogs is characterised by the {{degeneration}} of the photoreceptor {{cells of}} the retina, resulting in vision loss and eventually complete blindness. The condition affects more than 100 dog breeds and {{is known to be}} genetically heterogeneous between breeds. Around 19 mutations have now been identified that are associated with PRA in around 49 breeds, but for the majority of breeds the mutation(s) responsible have yet to be identified. Using genome-wide association with 22 Tibetan Spaniel PRA cases and 10 controls, we identified a novel PRA locus, PRA 3, on CFA 10 (p(raw) = 2. 01 × 10 (- 5), p(genome) = 0. 014), where a 3. 8 Mb region was homozygous within 12 cases. Using targeted next generation sequencing, a short interspersed nuclear element insertion was identified near a splice acceptor site in an intron of a provocative gene, FAM 161 A. Analysis of mRNA from an affected dog revealed that the SINE causes exon skipping, resulting in a frame shift, leading to a downstream premature termination codon and possibly a truncated protein product. This mutation segregates with the disease in 22 out of 35 cases tested (63 %). Of the PRA controls, none are homozygous for the mutation, 15 % carry the mutation and 85 % are homozygous wildtype. This mutation was also identified in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers,</b> although our results indicate that PRA is genetically heterogeneous in both Tibetan Spaniels and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terriers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} average {{lifespan}} of the breed at 12 years. About {{one in five}} lives to 15 years or more, with the longest-lived <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> having lived to 18.25 years. [...] Though an athletic breed that has been bred for a natural look, the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> is nonetheless susceptible {{to a variety of}} health problems, especially those related to the eyes and joints. These problems can include canine hip dysplasia, luxating patella, progressive retinal atrophy, lens luxation, cataracts and heart murmurs. Tibetans also have a history of being somewhat allergic to dairy, wheat and grains. Because of these potential health conditions <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> clubs recommend purchasing from breeders who participate in eye and hip testing, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The cone-rod {{homeobox}} protein (CRX) is {{a member}} of the homeodomain-containing protein family expressed in the retinal photoreceptors and pinealocytes; it is involved in the regulation of the coordinate expression of multiple photoreceptor specific genes during retinal development. Mutations in the CRX gene are causally associated with retinal degeneration phenotypes in man. To clone the full length cDNA, characterize the genomic organization of canine CRX, map the gene in a radiation hybrid (RH) panel, and evaluate it as a candidate for canine inherited retinal degenerations. Methods: cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) was done using normal and cone degeneration (cd) affected retinas. Exonic primers designed from consensus sequences of mammalian CRX cDNA were used to amplify and sequence dog genomic DNA. Canine specific primers were used for RH mapping of CRX on the RH 3000 cell line. Linkage, sequencing and/or mapping the disease locus was used to evaluate CRX as a disease associated candidate gene. Results: The gene comprises three exons and two introns and codes for a transcript with a 900 bp open reading frame (ORF). In agreement with human map data, RH mapping placed canine CRX on the proximal end of CFA 1, in a region of synteny with HSA 19 q 13 -q 13. 3. Based on RH mapping, meiotic linkage or sequencing data, we excluded CRX as the cause of canine early onset photoreceptor degenerations affecting Alaskan malamutes (cd), collies (rod-cone dysplasia 2, rcd 2), American Staffordshire <b>terriers,</b> and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>terriers.</b> Conclusions: Canine CRX has a high level of nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity with ortholgous sequences reported for other species. The gene is excluded from causal association with 4 early onset photoreceptor diseases affecting cones (cd) or rods and cones (rcd 2, PRA in American Staffordshire <b>terriers,</b> and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>terriers)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Primary lens {{luxation}} (PLL), {{a painful}} and blinding inherited condition, {{is common in}} several breeds of terrier. Here we have examined the Veterinary Medical Database of patient encounters and Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) cases records for the last 10 years and found the diagnosis recorded in 85 breeds. We have performed association analysis using a genome-wide microsatellite screen to map mutations underlying the condition in miniature bull terriers and Lancashire heelers. These studies show microsatellite alleles in disequilibriumwith disease status with highest support in a 6. 3 -Mbp region in {{the central part of}} chromosome 3 (log Pmax 5 6. 4). The same region also shows an association to the disease in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>terriers.</b> Tight junction protein- 1 (TJP 1) is a positional candidate to contain the PLL mutation. All recognized exons and splice junctions of TJP 1 have been sequenced from affected, obligate carrier and control Lancashire heeler dogs. Several polymor-phisms have been found, but these are not likely to cause the disease. Primary lens luxation (PLL) is a painful and blinding inherited ocular condition that has been reported in at least 45 canine breeds in the literature or veterinary ophthalmic texts (Curtis and Barnett 1980; Curtis 1990). It is a condition in which the lenses are displaced, usually to the anterior. Thi...|$|R

5000|$|The Tibetan Spaniel is a {{breed of}} assertive, small, {{intelligent}} dogs originating over 2,500 {{years ago in}} the Himalayan mountains of Tibet. They share ancestry with the Pekingese, Japanese Chin, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> and Pug.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> is a powerful, {{medium-sized}} dog {{of square}} proportions, with a shaggy coat. They vary widely in height and weight, ranging from 14-16 in (35-41 cm) and is 18-30 lb (8-14 kg), with 20-24 lb (9.5-11 kg) preferred for either sex. All weights are acceptable if {{in proportion to}} the size. Fully grown, the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> resembles a miniaturized Old English Sheepdog. The head is moderate, with a strong muzzle of medium length, and a skull neither rounded nor flat. The eyes are large, dark, and set fairly far apart. The V-shaped drop ears are well-feathered, and should be set high {{on the sides of the}} skull. Although the preferred colour for the nose is black, in showdogs, they are also sometimes brown. The body is well-muscled and compact. The length of the back should be equal to the height at the withers, giving the breed its typical square look. The tail is set high, well-feathered, and carried in a curl over the back. One of the more unusual features of the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>Terrier</b> is their broad, flat feet with hair between the toes, which are ideal for climbing mountains, acting as natural snow shoes.|$|E
