5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{found that a}} white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> less than a foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 2015, Black 5 steam {{locomotive}} 45231 Sherwood Forester was working a WCRC special through Doncaster {{when it was}} noticed that its TPWS had been isolated by the fireman.

5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought {{to be related to}} <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E

5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered at least one other classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E
5|$|Some early writers {{theorized that}} the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through {{competition}} with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids such as the American lion and the American cheetah also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests {{to the success of}} this feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was then {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they {{had no control over}} what happened to <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> completely appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.|$|E

5|$|When {{the train}} crossed into Poland, he tells <b>them,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were {{transferred}} to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe Night's first unheeded witness.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the Manhattan Valley {{neighborhood}} (then {{known as}} Bloomingdale), where the Master Building is located, saw its culturally-oriented middle class renters depart. Many of <b>them,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said, opted to buy {{houses in the}} suburban New York metropolitan area. As a consequence, the museum and cultural center lost their audience and in 1971 {{they were forced to}} close. Their holdings were donated to Brandeis University and cultural initiatives such as the Master Institute Chorus, founded in 1960, either folded, or, {{as in the case of}} the chorus, became affiliated with other organizations, such as the New Amsterdam Singers. The Horches' daughter, Oriole, became advisory consultant for the collection at Brandeis. The building's auditorium continued to present concerts, plays, readings, and lectures in the 1940s and into the 1950s. From 1961 through 1978 the Equity Library Theater leased it for productions showcasing the talents of New York actors.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> reported in 1992 that this species {{and two other}} pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E

5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers {{returned}} to ROH at the Fourth Anniversary Show in 2006, forcibly including {{themselves in a}} match that was at first between the teams of Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro and Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze.

They then feuded for the tag team championship again, but much as they had against Styles and Red three years earlier, they lost in three shots against the champions at the time, Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, at Ring of Homicide, Destiny, and Unified. As before, the storyline was that this cost them any chance at the belts {{for as long as}} those champs held <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> around this time that the Brothers became enforcers for Jim Cornette's heel character as ROH Commissioner, fighting battles against his enemies, most notably Homicide and his partner Samoa Joe at Glory By Honor V: Night Two and in anything goes, falls count anywhere, elimination match at Dethroned.

5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from <b>them.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E
