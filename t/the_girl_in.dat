5|$|In November 2015, it was {{announced}} that Sony was planning on rebooting the franchise with an adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> the Spider's Web, a 2015 novel by David Lagercrantz that was a continuation of the original Millennium trilogy after series creator Stieg Larsson died in 2004.

The theme is about <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> {{able to get into}} the club, even though they are underage. When Jacque drops her real I.D the {{security}} guard goes into the club trying to find her, but fails. This version premiered in April 2010.|$|R
5|$|The scene changes {{back to the}} {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the tower and the identity of the two men are revealed to be the same from the previous sequence.

5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.|$|E

In September 2017, Claire Foy was officially cast for the role of Lisbeth Salander in the new film.|$|E
5|$|Riya has {{suffered}} a number of untimely incidents. During the filming of Shaadi No. 1 in France, she was knocked unconscious after being accidentally {{run over by a}} stuntman's motorbike, but she was not seriously injured. Shortly before the release of Silsiilay, in which she starred opposite her boyfriend Ashmit Patel, a 90-second video clip was circulated on Multimedia Messaging Services and the internet, showing the pair in compromising situations in a hotel bedroom. This was {{one of a number of}} controversies that erupted when celebrities were caught in similar situations using cameraphones. Following this incident, the couple split up, although Riya denied that she was <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the MMS clip. One commentator claimed that the footage was an orchestrated publicity stunt. In 2007, she underwent a brief detoxification period in Bangkok for addiction to chocolate.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated she {{was in the}} scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a shower curtain and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E

Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} The Demi-Virgin, Hopwood was a {{well-established}} author of bedroom comedies. His past {{efforts in the}} genre included Fair and Warmer, produced by Edgar Selwyn in 1915, and The Gold Diggers, produced by David Belasco in 1919. Producer Albert H. Woods had an even longer track record in the genre, starting with The Girl from Rector's in 1909. Such material had been very profitable for Woods, who commissioned originals and adapted foreign farces, and for Hopwood, {{who was one of}} the most successful authors in the genre. Their first work together was <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> the Limousine in 1919, which Hopwood revised from an earlier script by Wilson Collison. Hopwood then helped revise Ladies' Night in 1920 and Getting Gertie's Garter in 1921. The Demi-Virgin was Hopwood's first play written for Woods without a collaborator. Hopwood was inspired by an earlier theatrical adaptation of Les Demi-vierges, an 1894 novel by the French writer Marcel Prévost that had been dramatized in 1895, but used little from it beyond the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
