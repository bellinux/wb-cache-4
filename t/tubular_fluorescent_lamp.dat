40|$|The gas {{temperature}} and the absolute {{density of the}} argon 4 S 3 P 2 level in an 80 W inductively coupled low-pressure argon - mercury plasma are determined for three different argon filling pressures. This is done by measuring the line profile of the 4 S 3 P 2 - 2 ̆ 6 gt; 4 P 3 D 3 transition in argon, using a tuneable laser diode. Since the width of this argon line is found {{to depend on the}} kinetic heavy particle temperature only, radial profiles of the {{gas temperature}} can be obtained. It turns out that the maximum gas temperature in this discharge (550 - 810 K depending on the filling pressure) is significantly higher than that in a common <b>tubular</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> From the radial distribution of the argon 4 s density it can be concluded that the maxima of the electron density and of the electron temperature are situated close to the coil.

40|$|The {{availability}} of T 5 high-efficiency (HE) and high-output (HO) <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> families not only increases {{the number of}} commonly used <b>tubular</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> from 9 to 18, but more importantly, increases the chance of ballast-lamp mismatch because T 5 (HO) and T 5 (HE) lamps have similar physical outlooks and dimensions but vastly different lamp characteristics. The large number of lamp types increases the number of specific ballast designs and users have the new inconvenience of ensuring the correct matching of the lamps and ballasts. In this paper, a survey and analysis of lamp characteristics of all commonly used T 5, T 8 and T 12 <b>tubular</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> is presented. Based on the heated lamp electrodes, lamp voltage and lamp current, a classification system that maps the lamp characteristics into various groups for automatic lamp detection is proposed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic foot {{pressure}} measurement is necessary particularly for diabetic patients to prevent ulcers, eventually leading to gangrene and amputation. The present work reports a low cost optical sensing {{system for the}} above, suitable for the Third World. It uses a horizontally placed transparent Acrylic plate with a webcam placed below facing upwards. A white paper, backed by a black adhesive plastic sheet, covered the whole plate on the top. Light from a <b>tubular</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> entered the acrylic plate from a side and traversed the thickness through total internal reflection. At points of pressure applied from the top, the air between the paper and the acrylic plate got displaced and caused breakdown of total internal reflection. The scattered light rays from the white sheet were recorded by the webcam. Computer software on Java platform was developed to grab and analyse video data to display dynamic pressure distribution in artificial colour contours. Approximate pressure calibration was obtained using static and dynamic values obtained from subjects with normal and abnormal foot pressures. Time graphs of pressure at user chosen points were also provided. The developed system worked with satisfaction and is being used for clinical assessment regularly...|$|E

Power consumption costs of artificial lighting systems is the second largest expense related to broiler industry, second only to feed expenses.

40|$|Low-pressure {{discharge}} lamps obey {{a set of}} physical laws that {{are different from those}} of high-pressure {{discharge lamps}}. In this paper, these differences are addressed. Based on a recently developed HID lamp model frame, a semi-theoretical <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of <b>tubular</b> and compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10 %. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The Australian {{government}} {{has introduced a}} policy to replace all inefficient incandescent lamps with energy saving compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> by 2010.

40|$|Comparison {{was made}} between the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and the {{incandescent}} lamp basing on qualitative experiments, and the following conclusion was reached. (1) In incandescent lamps when the reflection factor {{of the color of}} reflector is smaller, intensity of illumination will be so much the lower. The same tendency is seen with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> but the effect is generally smaller as compared with incandescent lamps. Furthermore, when the color of reflector belongs to the same color group as the dominant wave-length of the light-source, intensity of illumination will be stronger. In case it is of the complementary hue or of the same color group, illumination comes out weaker. (2) When various artificial light-sources are mutually compared by the quantities of filtered radiation, it is found that the light of daylight and white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> resembles most closely the daylight in cloudy weather. In incandescent lamps, the zone of long wave-length is in excess, while the blue and violet zones can hardly be seen. (3) Even among the persons with normal sense of color, a high percentage of misreading and hard-reading of Stilling's Charts occurs under the illumination by an incandescent lamp, whereas under that of a white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> the percentage is extremely lower.
