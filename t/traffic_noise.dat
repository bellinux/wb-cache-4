5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and <b>traffic</b> <b>noise.</b> Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads <b>traffic</b> <b>noise</b> policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane. The widening of the road distanced the houses {{on the east side of}} Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass.

25|$|Although speed bumps are {{effective}} in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial—as they can increase <b>traffic</b> <b>noise,</b> may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle (often found in private car parks) can be disruptive for drivers, and {{may be difficult to}} navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost $50–200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce <b>traffic</b> <b>noise</b> at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E

The cornerstone containing the year of dedication, commonly found on the outside facade of most temples, is located in the interior lobby next to the elevator which leads to the chapel portion of the building. Inside the temple, beehives are carved into the molding, and door handles that look like the Statue of Liberty torch are found throughout.

In order to contribute to this problem a series of the Simulated Domestic Living Room experiments were carried out both at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research and Muroran Institute of Technology. In Experiment I (ISVR) and Experiment Ⅲ (Muroran) the dose-response relations of separately reproduced aircraft, railroad, and road <b>traffic</b> <b>noises</b> were investigated. Whereas in Experiment Ⅱ (ISVR) and Experiment Ⅳ, aircraft and road <b>traffic</b> <b>noises</b> were systematically combined and the dose-response relations of the mixed source noises were investigated. The findings are summarized as follows : ① The Simulated Domestic Living Room procedure is validated to a satisfactory extent through four independent experiments carried out in two different countries. ② L_ is proven useful to the {{evaluation of}} annoyance due to the same noise source. It shows, however, a discrepancy in evaluating the annoyance due to different noise sources.
