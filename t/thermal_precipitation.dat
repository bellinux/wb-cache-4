40|$|ABSTRACT: While protein {{purification}} {{has long}} been dom-inated by standard chromatography, the relatively high cost and complex scale-up have promoted the development of alternative non-chromatographic separation methods. Here we developed a new non-chromatographic affinity method for the purification of proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The approach is to genetically fuse the target proteins with an affinity tag. Direct purification and recovery can be achieved using a thermo-responsive elastin-like protein (ELP) scaffold containing the capturing domain. Naturally occurring cohesin–dockerin pairs, which are high-affinity protein complex responsible {{for the formation of}} cellulo-some in anaerobic bacteria, were used as the model. By exploiting the highly specific interaction between the dock-erin and cohesin domain from Clostridium thermocellum and the reversible aggregation property of ELP, highly purified and active dockerin-tagged proteins, such as the endoglucanase CelA, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), were recovered directly from crude cell extracts in a single <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitation</b> step with yields achieving over 90 %. Incorporation of a self-cleaving intein domain enabled rapid removal of the affinity tag from the target proteins, which was subsequently removed by another cycle of <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitation.</b> This method offers great flexibility as a wide range of affinity tags and ligands can be used...|$|E

Here, we report on the total protein extraction from sugar beet leaves (Beta vulgaris L.) by a traditional thermal extraction method consisting of mechanical pressing, heating to 50 °C and centrifugation. The resulting streams (i. e. supernatant, green-protein pellet and fibrous pulp) were characterised in terms of composition, physical structure and processing options. The protein distributed almost equally over the supernatant, pellet and pulp.

We chose poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (polyNIPA) as a platform, which phase-separates from water upon heating. The thermally responsive properties and applications of polyNIPA are introduced in Chapter One. In Chapter Two, we described {{the synthesis of}} polyNIPA gels with an imidazole comomoer and examined copper ion adsorption by the swollen (room temperature) and shrunken gels (60 ⁰C). The data analysis using a Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicates that the imidazole groups form 2 : 1 and 4 : 1 complexes with a copper ion in the swollen and shrunken gels, respectively, which suggests that thermal gel swelling and shrinking control the formation of multivalent Cu complexes by changing the distance among imidazole groups. In Chapters Three to Six, the synthesis of polyNIPA-conjugated polymer block copolymers and their applications are described. Non-ionic water-soluble poly(phenylene-ethynylene) s (PPEs) (Chapter Three) were used as conjugated polymer segments in the block copolymers. In a route to synthesis of the block copolymers, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP) of NIPA were developed. Incorporation of ATRP or NMRP initiators to the polymer ends of PPEs and the following polymerizations of NIPA were expected to provide tri-block copolymers with precise structures. The ATRP method produced pure polyNIPA with monodisperse and defined molecular weights (Chapter Four). However, endcapping of PPEs with an ATRP initiator ((α-chloroamide) was not successful due to its instability to PPE polymerization conditions (Chapter Five). (cont.) On the other hand, PPEs could be endcapped with a NMRP initiator (a tert-butyl nitroxide derivative), and the following NMRP of NIPA provided the tri-block copolymers (Chapter Six), phase-separate from aqueous solutions upon heating due to the polyNIPA aggregation. In Chapter Six, we examined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a PPE-polyNIPA block copolymer and Rhodamine B (RhB) bound to polyNIPA.

Supersaturated vanadium(V) electrolytes were prepared by electrolytic oxidation of V(IV) solution in different sulfuric acid concentrations to investigate the stability and properties of V(V) solutions over a temperature range of 20 °C- 50 °C. The evaluation of thew V(V) solutions based on desupersaturation experiments, properties such as density, conductivity, viscosity, and cyclic voltammetry and 51 V NMR studies indicated that 3. 0 - 3. 5 M V(V) solution in 5 - 6 M total sulfate/bisulfate is a suitable composition for a high energy density vanadium redox. battery. Further increase in V(V) concentration above 3. 5 M, decreases the conductivity, electrochemical activity and reversibility, and increases the viscosity exponentially. It was found that the induction time for the precipitation of V 2 O 5 from V(V) solutions increases with increasing sulfuric acid concentrations because of increases in H+ ions, formation of sulfate/bisulfate complexes and dimerisation/polymerisation of VO 2 + ions. The kinetic study of <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitation</b> of V(V) solutions indicated that the growth rate follows first order kinetics; under the conditions of low supersaturations and it obeys a second order rate equation at high supersaturations. Supersaturated V(V) solutions when exposed to atmosphere absorbs significant moisture which affect the properties and precipitation behaviour. A large number of additives and their blends were evaluated to inhibit the precipitation of supersaturated V(V) solutions at 40 °C. A phosphate based formulation, KS 11, was found to increase the induction time of 4 M V(V) solution in 6 M total sulfate/bisulfate by about 10 times. The formulation KS 11 also exhibited encouraging results against the precipitation of supersaturated V(II) and V(IV) solutions. pitation of supersaturated V(II) and V(IV) solutions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Investigation of {{mechanisms}} underlying transcriptional {{regulation of}} Sso 2536, encoding for an alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh) in the crenarchaeon S. solfataricus has shown an active 5 ’ flanking region responsive to physiologically relevant DNA binding proteins. In particular, one DNA binding protein, Bald 16 (Sso 1352), {{has been identified}} whose levels are higher when cells are grown {{in the presence of}} the toxic benzaldehyde, substrate of the ADH enzyme; it has been proposed that this protein could act as a transcriptional activator triggering adh expression to protect cells from an environmental stress due to phenolic-derived aldehydes. Bald 16 encodes for a putative transcriptional regulator, which has a bacterial homologue belonging to the Mar (Multiple Antibiotic Resistance) family of regulators involved in the control of gene expression of aromatic compound metabolism and antibiotic resistance. To better investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in S. solfataricus, with greater attention with respect to defense response upon chemical stress, we analyzed the expression of the bald 16 gene in the presence of aromatic aldehydes. Furthermore, recombinant Bald 16 has been obtained in E. coli and characterized for its DNA binding activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS S. solfataricus cultures were grown in different conditions among which DSM 182 medium supplemented with 1 mM benzaldehyde, 1 mM veratrylaldehyde, 0, 35 mM cynnamaldehyde and harvested at exponential or stationary phase. mRNA and crude extracts were prepared according to conventional procedures to perform Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Recombinant Bald 16 was obtained by PCR amplification of the Sso 1352 ORF and cloning in the pTrc 99 A vector and purified by <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitation</b> and three chromatographic steps. Functional analysis has been performed essentially by band shift analysis and DNAseI footprinting using synthetic double stranded oligonucleotides designed on the sequences of the adh or bald 16 promoter and DNA fragments prepared by endonuclease restriction of the 5 ’ flanking regions upstream of the adh or bald 16 gene. RESULTS Transcriptional analysis of the Bald 16 gene allowed the identification of a new a mar-like locus in S. solfataricus composed of a putative multidrug transporter and the transcriptional regulator downstream (Sso 1351, Sso 1352). The genes are transcribed as a polycistronic unit whose expression is sensitive to the addition to the cell growth medium of different aromatic aldehydes. The gene encoding for the transcriptional regulator, has been overexpressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein purified to homogeneity. The protein is indeed a DNA binding protein, which binds site-specifically to both the adh and Bald 16 promoters, reasonably strengthening the hypothesis of a coordinate expression in response to stress determined by phenolic-derived materials...|$|E
40|$|In collisionless space plasmas, {{the energy}} cascade from larger to smaller scales {{requires}} effective interactions between ions and electrons. These interactions are organized by sub-ion scale plasma structures in which strong electric fields connect demagnetized ions to magnetized electrons. We consider one such structure, magnetic holes, observed by THEMIS spacecraft in the dipolarized hot plasma sheet. Magnetic holes are localized depressions {{of the magnetic}} field with strong currents at their boundaries. Taking advantage of slow plasma convection (∼ 10 − 20 km/s), we reconstruct the electron velocity distribution within magnetic holes and demonstrate that the current at their boundaries is predominantly carried by magnetized thermal electrons. The motion of these electrons is the combination of diamagnetic drift and E × B drift in a Hall electric field. Magnetic holes can effectively modulate the intensity of electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, and thus the spatial distribution of <b>thermal</b> electron <b>precipitation.</b> They may also contain field-aligned currents with magnitudes of ∼ 5 nA/m 2 (one order of magnitude smaller than the cross-field current density). Therefore, sub-ion scale magnetic holes can be important for ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of Al-Zn alloys, {{with the}} Zn atom fraction, χZn ≤ 62 %, {{has been studied}} in detail by XRD in dependence on the composition, temperature and previous <b>thermal</b> treatment. <b>Precipitation</b> phenomena in alloys, transferred to the supersaturated state by rapid quenching from the solid solution temperature, Tss, in water at RT, have been followed in dependence on the ageing time at RT or elevated temperature. The equilibrium state, reached by ageing, has been compared with that obtained by slow cooling from Tss to RT. Phase transitions, dissolution and precipitation processes in the alloys, transferred to the equilibrium state, have been studied in situ in dependence on temperature from RT to Tss. A temperature hysteresis in reversal phase transitions has been observed on cooling from Tss to RT. Repeated heating and cooling cycles have revealed different microstructure in alloys having undergone different thermal treatments between RT and Tss. A change in the phase diagram of the Al-Zn system is necessary in the composition region χZn > 50 %...|$|R

It {{has been}} proved that the {{two-stage}} martensitic transformation in the NiTi alloys preceded by the R-phase transition my be induced by: low temperature annealing of the deformed alloy, <b>thermal</b> cycling and <b>precipitation</b> caused by ageing, The TEM observations of samples with two stage transformation {{have shown that the}} 'dislocations are distributed inhomogeneously and form a small-angle subgrain boundaries. The Granato-Lucke analysis. of the internal friction peaks related to the two-stage transformation confirmed the difference in dislocation density released in both stages.
