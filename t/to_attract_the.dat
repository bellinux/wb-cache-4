5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E

40|$|Canada’s {{medium-sized}} {{cities have}} recently experienced a significant net loss in human capital growth attributed alone to internal migration. Subsequently, the largest {{cities in the}} country have received a net growth in human capital {{in part due to}} internal migration. Using mixed qualitative methods {{in the form of a}} policy document analysis and in-depth key informant interviews, this study aims to understand how and to what extent institutional relations are leveraging post-secondary education institutions in medium-sized city-regions of Ontario <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> and retain <b>the</b> highly skilled. The results of this study reveal that limited collaboration to leverage the post-secondary education institutions <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> and retain <b>the</b> highly skilled exists. Accordingly, post-secondary education institutions are largely unresponsive <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>the</b> highly skilled into their host communities. This study challenges a new way of thinking about how to utilize post-secondary education institutions in the knowledge economy to promote economic development...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool.

5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá.

In 1953, the specimens began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> attention of biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Bruce began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all {{reported to be}} interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E
