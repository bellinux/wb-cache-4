In 1829 and 1830 I became acquainted with some of their writings. They were then only in the earlier stages of their speculations. They had not yet dressed out their philosophy as a religion, nor had they organized their scheme of Socialism. They were just beginning <b>to</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of hereditary property. I {{was by no means}} prepared to go with them even this length; but I was greatly struck with the connected view which they for the first time presented to me, of the natural order of human progress; and especially with their division of all history into organic periods and critical periods. During the organic periods (they said) mankind accept with firm conviction some positive creed, claiming jurisdiction over all their actions, and containing more or less of truth and adaptation to the needs of humanity. Under its influence they make all the progress compatible with the creed, and finally outgrow it; when a period follows of criticism and negation, in which mankind lose their old convictions without acquiring any new ones, of a general or authoritative character, except the conviction that the old are false. The period of Greek and Roman polytheism, so long as really believed in by instructed Greeks and Romans, was an organic period, succeeded by the critical or sceptical period of the Greek philosophers. Another organic period came in with Christianity. The corresponding critical period began with the Reformation, has lasted ever since, still lasts, and cannot altogether cease until a new organic period has been inaugurated by the triumph of a yet more advanced creed. These ideas, I knew, were not peculiar to the St. Simonians; on the contrary, they were the general property of Europe, or at least of Germany and France, but they had never, to my knowledge, been so completely systematized as by these writers, nor the distinguishing characteristics of a critical period so powerfully set forth; for I was not then acquainted with Fichte's Lectures on the Characteristics of the Present Age. In Carlyle, indeed, I found bitter denunciations of an [...] "age of unbelief," [...] and of the present age as such, which I, like most people at that time, supposed to be passionate protests in favour of the old modes of belief. But all that was true in these denunciations, I thought that I found more calmly and philosophically stated by the St. Simonians. Among their publications, too, there was one which seemed to me far superior to the rest; in which the general idea was matured into something much more definite and instructive. This was an early work of Auguste Comte, who then called himself, and even announced himself in the title-page as, a pupil of Saint Simon. In this tract M. Comte first put forth the doctrine, which he afterwards so copiously illustrated, of the natural succession of three stages in every department of human knowledge: first, the theological, next the metaphysical, and lastly, the positive stage; and contended, that social science must be subject to the same law; that the feudal and Catholic system was the concluding phasis of the theological state of the social science, Protestantism the commencement, and the doctrines of the French Revolution the consummation, of the metaphysical; and that its positive state was yet to come. This doctrine harmonized well with my existing notions, to which it seemed to give a scientific shape. I already regarded the methods of physical science as the proper models for political. But the chief benefit which I derived at this time from the trains of thought suggested by the St. Simonians and by Comte, was, that I obtained a clearer conception than ever before of the peculiarities of an era of transition in opinion, and ceased to mistake the moral and intellectual characteristics of such an era, for the normal attributes of humanity. I looked forward, through the present age of loud disputes but generally weak convictions, to a future which shall unite the best qualities of the critical with the best qualities of the organic periods; unchecked liberty of thought, unbounded freedom of individual action in all modes not hurtful to others; but also, convictions as to what is right and wrong, useful and pernicious, deeply engraven on the feelings by early education and general unanimity of sentiment, and so firmly grounded in reason and in the true exigencies of life, that they shall not, like all former and present creeds, religious, ethical, and political, require to be periodically thrown off and replaced by others.|$|E

Mais especificamente, na vers?o standard, terceira etapa, ?A l?ngua como constituinte de significa??o? e ainda na Teoria dos Topoi. A tese central dessa teoria diz respeito ao fato de que na pr?pria estrutura da l?ngua h? elementos que apresentam valores argumentativos e, por isso, t?m a responsabilidade de possibilitar ou n?o a continuidade do discurso. Logo, esses elementos, denominados pelos autores da sem?ntica argumentativa como operadores argumentativos, possuem a fun??o de orientar os enunciados para determinadas e poss?veis conclus?es. Tamb?m postulada por Ducrot, subsidia nossa pesquisa a Teoria Polif?nica da Enuncia??o, que objetiva questionar o princ?pio da unicidade do sujeito falante. Para a Teoria Polif?nica ducrotiana, ? por meio da presen?a de alguns elementos lingu?sticos, nos discursos, que os enunciadores s?o postos em cena. Al?m dos estudos da TAL, apresentamos, brevemente, alguns princ?pios sobre os estudos da modaliza??o discursiva, tendo em vista a relev?ncia dos elementos modalizadores no comportamento do locutor frente aos enunciadores, em alguns casos, durante nossas an?lises. Logo, figurar?o no nosso quadro te?rico sobre esses estudos autores como Castilho e Castilho (1993), Cervoni (1989), Neves (2010), Nascimento (2005, 2012), dentre outros. Lan?ando m?o dos estudos da Teoria da Argumenta??o na L?ngua e sobre o fen?meno da modaliza??o discursiva, constitui objetivo nosso, nesta pesquisa, realizar uma an?lise e descri??o do funcionamento sem?ntico-argumentativo dos operadores de contraposi??o no g?nero resumo acad?mico, a partir de uma perspectiva lingu?stico-discursiva. A metodologia empregada nesta pesquisa ? de natureza descritiva e quanti-qualitativa, visto que estaremos atentos n?o apenas ao funcionamento desses operadores, mas tamb?m ? quantidade de ocorr?ncia dos referidos elementos. O corpus, aqui em an?lise, ? constitu?do por 300 resumos acad?micos publicados em anais e revistas de car?ter cient?fico-acad?mico. Os resultados indicam para uma predomin?ncia do uso dos operadores de contraposi??o com fun??o masPA, em detrimento dos operadores com fun??o masSN. Al?m desse fato, ? pertinente pontuar que esta pesquisa amplia o que ? proposto por Ducrot (1988), quando das possibilidades de posicionamento do locutor frente aos enunciadores - este autor aponta apenas para o recha?o, a aprova??o e a identifica??o ? uma vez que constatamos a exist?ncia de duas esp?cies de recha?o: total e parcial. Ainda no tocante ?s an?lises, identificamos a presen?a marcante de topos e informa??o compartilhada nos resumos, acionada, ou n?o, pelos operadores de contraposi??o, o que demonstra que, al?m de estabelecerem rela??es entre os termos, no sentido de funcionarem como elementos coesivos, esses operadores, no g?nero resumo acad?mico, s?o utilizados como estrat?gia argumentativa, pois orientam os enunciados para determinadas conclus?es e materializam, nos pr?prios enunciados, v?rios pontos de vista e cren?as que podem ser contestadas, ou n?o, pelo interlocutor. The {{present study}} is guided by the Language Argument Theory (LAT), {{postulated}} by Jean-Claude Anscombre/Oswald Ducrot (1994) and Ducrot (1987, 1988). More specifically, in the standard version, the third stage, ?The language as a constituent of meaning? {{and also in the}} Topoi Theory. The central thesis of this theory concerns that in the own language structure there are elements that present argumentative values, and, because of this, they have the responsibility for enabling or not the continuity of the discourse. Therefore, these elements, named by the authors of argumentative semantics as argumentative operators, have the function for orienting the statements to particular and possible conclusions. Also postulated by Ducrot, subsidizes our research the Polyphonic Theory of Enunciation, that aims <b>to</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the speaking subject uniqueness. For the Ducrotian Polyphonic Theory, it is through the presence of some linguistic elements, in the discourses, that the enunciators are put on the scene. In addition to the LAT studies, we present, briefly, some principles about the studies of discursive modalization, considering the relevance of the modalizers elements on the speaker behavior in the face of enunciators, in some cases, during our analysis. Thus, authors like Castilho and Castilho (1993), Cervoni (1989), Neves (2010), Nascimento (2005, 2012), among others, will be present in our theoretical framework about these studies. Based on the Argument Theory in language and the phenomenon of the discursive modalization, our objective, in this research, is to realize an analysis and a description of the semantic-argumentative functioning of contrapositive operators in the academic abstract genre, from a linguistic-discursive perspective. The methodology used in this study is descriptive and quanti-qualitative, since we will be attentive not only to the functioning of these operators, but also to the quantity of times that the referred elements occur. The corpus, here in analysis, is constituted by 300 academic abstracts published in annals and magazines with scientific-academic character. The results indicate a predominance of the use of contrapositive operators with the masPA function, to the detriment of operators with function masSN. Furthermore, it is pertinent to punctuate that this research expands what is proposed by Ducrot (1988), about the possibilities of the speaker positioning in the face of enunciators ? this author points only to the rebound, approval and identification ? once we found the existence of two species of rebound: total and partial. Still in relation to the analysis, we identify the important presence of topos and information shared in the abstracts, activated, or not, by the contrapositive operators, what demonstrates that, beyond establishing relations between the terms, in the sense of functioning as cohesive elements, these operators, in the academic abstract genre, are used as argumentative strategy, because they guide the statements to particular conclusions and materialize, in the own statements, many points of view and beliefs that can be contested, or not, by the interlocutor...|$|E

In determining lead-ership, the fa‘asämoa (Samoan way) and the fa‘amatai (way of the chiefs) are the most influential factors. Yet this has not prevented Sämoa from experiencing governance problems found in other countries of the region (although perhaps on a lesser scale) : misunderstanding, frustration, alien-ation, migration, discrimination, malpractice, patronage, and violence. Reasons for this may be (1) a lack of correspondence between fa‘asämoa and liberal democracy; (2) a lack of general understanding and critical assessment of <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of liberal democracy in Sämoa; (3) a combi-nation of misuse, abuse, or misunderstanding of fa‘asämoa; and (4) a lack of publicity and critical assessment of <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of fa‘asämoa. <b>The</b> governance agenda promoted by international agencies and bilat-eral donors, and publicly adhered to by the Samoan government, attempts to deal with problems through legislative and institutional reform.

Community Policing tries to improve the cooperation between the population and the police and to increase the trust in the police. A crucial factor is a meaningful cooperation between the police and the citizens. Problem Oriented Policing aims at structural changes in the organisation and the procedures of the police in public.

40|$|In Sweden an oral hearing, the trial, is held as {{the ideal}} model for the {{criminal}} procedure and according to <b>the</b> legality <b>principle</b> reported crimes ought to be investigated and prosecuted. Over time high levels of reported crimes have led {{to an increase in}} pressure on the courts and other actors in the criminal process. This pressure has created new ways of dealing with reported crimes in summary procedures and to exceptions from <b>the</b> legality <b>principle.</b> Such changes have given the prosecutor a key role in deciding how cases are dealt with in the criminal process.   The purpose of this thesis is to examine the Swedish public prosecutor’s influence on the choice of cases that are investigated, prosecuted and tried in court during a trial. The study examines the prosecutors’ legal authority and how that authority has changed from the time that the Code of Judicial Procedure came into force in 1948 to the beginning of 2011. A starting point for the examination is that investigating, prosecuting and trying cases in the criminal process should be carried out {{in a way that is}} considered to be fair according to societal values, which are embedded in the legal system. Both decisions about which cases will be tried and the procedure involved in how to try them has to be performed in a way that seems to be fair. In the study the values that underlie the criminal process is examined through a model. This model assumes that the criminal process has been created and developed to satisfy different requirements, which can be separated into three main groups: the functions of the criminal process, legal <b>principles</b> and <b>the</b> main objectives of a good administration of justice. The model is used to analyze and discuss the development of the legal rules. The prosecutor’s authority and influence over the process has broadened and the use of summary procedures has served to place the focus on the police investigation instead of the trial. Among the objectives of a good administration of justice Speed and Cost effectiveness are considered to be more important than Security. As long as the Trust in the system is sufficient this development can continue. A conclusion from the study is that there is a need for some actor to prioritize and to do that openly.

40|$|Abstract] In {{the article}} How to Make Our Ideas Clear, {{published}} in 1878 by Popular Science Montly, Peirce presents his classical pragmatic maximum «Consider whatever effects, which could conceivably have practical consequences, we imagine inherent {{to the purpose}} of our conception». The conception of such effects establishes the whole of our conception of the object, pointing to a sense of intellectual meaning and differs from the idea of pragmatism in the current utilitarian sense at that time. Peirce did not mean that actions could be the purpose or the proper and adequate interpretation of any symbol (CP 5. 402) provided that he was not in favor of life under the sole objective of the action detached from a rational thought or purpose (CP 5. 429). Subsequently, between 1892 and 1893, his manuscripts The Law of Mind (1892), and Evolutionary Love (1893) provide the foundation in 1898, for the structure of the Habit, presented at the sixth and seventh Cambridge Conferences. In Habit, in 1898, Peirce argues about the one and the multiple, and the real character of the universal, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> that <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of retroduction leads in the sense of pursuing the unity between the physical and the mental as much as possible. Consequently, establishing the conceptual link among concept, general idea, concept and habit for the constitution of the embodiment process of habits by the repetition of the general idea, or the composite idea, or the quality brought to consciousness. This article will bring the research in the cognitive scope of habit as a result of he repeated occurrence from the general idea brought to consciousness, introducing the terms «conception» and «concept» to achieve a rereading of the embodiment process of the habits by general ideas from one hand, and understand the general idea as the mark of habit (CP 7. 498 1898) ...|$|R

Deutschland hat unerwartet die Wirtschaftsturbulenzen seit 2008 besser Ã¼berstanden, als vielfach gerade im englischsprachigen Raum erwartet worden ist. Gleichzeitig haben freiere Marktwirtschaften wie die USA und GroÃbritannien den Glanz frÃ¼herer (vermeintlicher) dauerhaft besserer Wirtschaftsdynamik verloren. Die Renaissance von ordoliberalen Konzepten auch im Zuge der BekÃ¤mpfung der Krise im Euroraum lÃ¤sst es als angemessen erscheinen zu prÃ¼fen, wie {{relevant}} das Modell Sozialer Marktwirtschaft auch fÃ¼r Russland sein kÃ¶nnte. Aus Sicht des Autors wÃ¼rde eine angemessene Ãbertragung dieser Prinzipien auch zu besseren Aussichten auf dauerhaften Wohlstand in Russland beitragen. The ordo-liberal inspired Social Market Economy {{that emerged}} from west German economists and lawyers {{of the second half}} of the 1940 s has perhaps attracted more attention in the international academic debate. Than prior to the financial crisis that became obvious to a wider public in 2008. Prior to this even the approach of âGerman neo-liberalismâ (i. e. ordo-liberalism) was neglected by many mainstream economists outside of Germany. Unexpectedly, Ge 3 rmany coped with turbulent economic times since 2008 much better than many spectators particularly in the Anglo-Saxon economies that support âfree marketâ-principles more than the German establishment have anticipated. Simultaneously, these latter economies have lost much of their former appeal as a result of their decreased dynamism and problems to cope with the current problems in recent years. The renaissance of German ordoliberal concepts during both the financial crisis and the crisis in the euro area leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of <b>the</b> Social Market Economy can also serve as a guide for reforms in Russia. According to the author, an appropriate implementation of these principles would lead to lastingly superior prospects of prosperity in Russia...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} empirical, embodied studies aimed to generate and regenerate aesthetic reasoning through three approaches: ·	an educational approach concerned with developing an aesthetic discipline, supporting a formgiving process aimed to create tangible artifacts. ·	an art-based approach supporting an open exploration of distortion and formlessness ·	a multi-disciplinary exploratory approach concerned with aesthetic experiences shared in laborations demonstrating complexity and transformation. The overall aim of the thesis is to explore different types of aesthetic abstractions that elaborate aesthetic reasoning about form and formlessness. The thesis develops methods and models for aesthetic investigation that support, challenge and go beyond the normative conceptions of beauty, with high relevance for teaching 3 -D formgiving aesthetics and research by design methodologies. A central method applied throughout the entire research project is a cooperative inquiry method engaging students and experienced professionals as co-researchers in embodied/ interactive physical form studies and laborations. The content of the thesis is presented in three parts relating to the approaches above: -Part 1 defines an aesthetic nomenclature organized within a taxonomy of form in space. This aesthetic taxonomy is outlined in five levels based on essential aesthetic abstractions, emphasizing structure and inner movement {{in relation to the}} intention {{for the development of a}} gestalt. It originates from the educational program of Alexander Kostellow and Rowena Reed and has been further developed through an iterative educational process using a Concept-translation-form method, resulting in the Evolution of Form (EoF) -model. This EoF-model reciprocally weaves together geometric structures and organic principles into a sequence of seven-stages. <b>To</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> normative <b>principles</b> of beauty inherent in the EoF-model, a bipolar +/- spectrum was introduced at each stage to expand the model, aiming for a more inclusive approach to aesthetics. -Part 2, both challenges and expands the aesthetic reasoning in part 1 through i) solo sculptural exhibitions exploring properties of distortion and transparency in a constructivist art community ii) collaborative projects with physicists concerning infinity and studies of continuous complex curvatures and iii) explorative studies of material breakdown and non-visual studies with ID masters students at Konstfack. - Part 3 problematizes the taxonomy of form by applying methods and results from a cross-disciplinary study of complexity and transformation involving artists, physicists, designers and architects. The three year study explored temporal events of changing phenomena and formlessness that did not comply with any traditional aesthetic norms. Based on the experience from 12 laborations, three models were developed: The Transformation-model and Framing the dialogue-model were developed to physically interact with as well as to document and discuss change and transformation through bipolar reasoning. The Aesthetic phase transition-model was developed to capture the particular properties expressed in a transformation and unify stable objects with changing events. In conclusion, the thesis claims the value of an inclusive aesthetic mode of abstract reasoning in the scientific and design communities. A provisional 3 modes of abstraction-model is presented placing numeric, linguistic and aesthetic modes of abstraction as interdependent within a spectrum from separation to contextualization...|$|R

The {{goal of the}} {{research}} was to attain <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> about <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of <b>the</b> Estonian radios. The current position of the Estonian radio market needed to be charted to archive the earlier mentioned goals among the radio stations as well as considering their economic parameters. It was also necessary to examine {{the specifics of the}} advertising vendition used in the different companies and the distribution of the revenue and cost bases. The main entry of the research work is the current position of the radio landscape, the revenue and cost basis of the radio companies, specifics of the advertising vendition of the radio companies and <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of <b>the</b> radios. The best circumstances that help us understand the discussed problem is that the radio landscape is variegated and in continuous progress in Estonia. Therefore the need for research and chart are necessary in some point recording the current situation and <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> on what basis the radio stations function at the moment. I have used the document analyses and semistructured <b>questionner</b> as <b>the</b> method of the research work. In consequence of the document analyses the Estonian radio market and the cost specifics of the radio companies have been described. <b>The</b> semistructured <b>questionner</b> gives <b>the</b> answers about the fullness of the companies revenue basis and about the specifics of the advertising venditions in the different radio stations. In the theoretical part I have been underlied the description of the Robert Picard business model on what grounds the model gives us the knowledge how the company organises its operating activities. The business model embraces the conception of the companies operations, the foundation base, the business field and the financial activities due to the fact he could be successful. Even though in the beginning of <b>the</b> research <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was set up about <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of <b>the</b> radios; finally I distinguished <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> found on <b>the</b> companies and the radio stations. The given overview enables us to educe <b>the</b> different <b>principles</b> more precisely and to differ them from each other. Based on the radio companies I have been distinguished the five different principles: • Radio companies that administer several radio stations • Organisations that maximize the resource of the sales team • Public organisation • Local radio companies • Nonprofit assocations Based on the radio stations I have been distinguished the four different principles: • Automatic radio stations • Semi-automatic radio stations • Radio stations depend on the labour • Rent radio station...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Viktor von Weizsäcker's psychosomatic and medical philosophy and Martin Heidegger's philosophy offers an exemplary constellation of the {{relationship between}} philosophy and psychiatry. As shown in this paper, the relevant constellation is constituted by fundamental differences regarding both the methods and kinds of <b>questions</b> proper <b>to</b> either discipline. This same constellation is thus significant not with respect to immediate influences but rather to more indirect aspects. To begin with it is here argued that in addition to articulating the phenomenonon of illness, von Weizsäcker began with the dialogic, interpersonal dynamic between physician and patient. Furthermore, a significant problem is constituted by the connection between illness, deformation, or the "pathogenic" or "pathic" {{on the one hand and}} truth on the other. In this way, von Weizsäcker postulates a radical renunciation of the terms of European metaphysics (and philosophy), i. e., between "Ionia and Jena," a renunciation confirmed by both the person and the philosophy of the important Jewish thinker, Franz Rosenzweig. By contrast, Heidegger's hermeneutically pre-formed phenomenology of Da-sein articulates an intensive transformation of the metaphysical thinking of 'the first beginning' [des ersten Anfangs], while remaining, nonetheless, within the horizon of metaphysics. Thus it can be shown that the transformative centre of traditional thinking is opposed in Heidegger and von Weizsäcker: Whereas von Weizsäcker poses fundamental <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> of philosophy, showing that such principles are unable either to describe or else to clarify the structures of 'pathic' phenomena, 'medical philosophy' nevertheless insists on [or: emphasizes] the importance of the subject. In its different psycho-somatic complexity, the subject persists as the insurmountable point of departure for the psychiatric point of view. The language of Heidegger's 'Dasein' is by contrast articulated to replace both the terminology as well as the problem of subjectivity as directed towards the Being-question. The focus of the psycho-somatic problem itself ultimately illustrates these same differences. From Heidegger's philosophical perspective, the body is the fairest and least explanatory phenomenon where von Weizsäcker' s thought, again by contrast, takes its key from the lines of the body (cf. Nietzsche 'Leitfaden des Leibes'). The paper accordingly argues that the discussion between Weizsäcker and Heidegger is constituted by a fundamental difference which also is one of its most inalienable conditions. Taken foundationally, this hermetic and hermeneutic discussion offers a crucial constellation for further relections on the relationship beteen philosophy and psychoanalysis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]. As the European Communities have unquestionably been exercising govermental {{power for}} many years, {{there is a}} need for {{democratic}} legitimation of this specific "Governance without Statehood. " To a far greater extent than ordinary international organizations, the European Union has crossed the boundary from horizontal interstate cooperation to vertical policy-making in a dynamic multi-level system, in which the member states are but one level of the polity. The European Union has developed into a new type of political system which lacks many of the features we associate with democratic governance. Whereas in the past the EC relied on indirect legitimacy based on its member states and their complete control of European policy-making, the "uneven denationalization" evoked by the European integration indicates that the sovereign state cannot remain the sole focus of normative reflection. Since the Single European Act (SEA) and the Treaty on European Union (TEU) the forced transfer of political decisions and allocations from the national to the European level has weakened democratic influence and control at the national level without having been compensated by equally strong democratic institutions and processes at the European level. Therefore, the European Union is a new subject for theories of legitimacy which poses fundamental <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> established <b>principles</b> and concepts of democratic theory. In this discussion paper I try to develop an argument why neither politicians nor academics still have not found any satisfactory solutions concerning the legitimacy problem of European Governance. First, I will give an overview of the main sources of legitimacy in the Euro-Polity (II.). It will be shown that the strict observation of formal rules of democracy at the European level is not the sole method in which multi-level governance in the EU might gain legitimacy. Regardless of this assumption, it is obvious that European policy-making suffers from a democratic deficit which must be taken seriously from a normative point of view. The academic debate about this democratic deficit is centered on the two dimensions of the problem, which will be presented in chapter III. On the one hand, the institutional arrangement of the EU often is interpreted as non-democratic. On the other hand, it is argued that the EU is unable to be a ‘real’ democracy in <b>principle</b> because <b>the</b> structural and social prerequisites on which democratic rule depends are missing at the European level. These are the main challenges for European constitutional engineering. The final part (IV.) consists of a discussion of varying reform options dealing with the multidimensional legitimacy problem...|$|R
