25|$|Typical ichthyosaurs {{had very}} large eyes, {{protected}} within a bony ring, {{suggesting that they}} may have hunted at night or at great depths; the only extant animals with similarly large eyes are the giant and colossal squids. Sight thus seems to {{have been one of the}} main senses employed while hunting. Hearing might have been poor, given the very robust form of the stapes. Grooves in the palate however, suggest <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> might have been acute or even that electro-sensory organs might have been present.|$|E
25|$|Both smokers and non-smokers in Syria {{acknowledge}} <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> {{and taste}} are noteworthy appealing factors of the narghile. This {{mention of the}} narghile’s sensory appeal signifies {{the importance of the}} introduction of Maasel, a specially prepared fruit-flavored tobacco, in replacement of Ajami, a raw unflavored tobacco, in regard to the growing popularity of the narghile. The spread of Maasel in the 1990s produced a surge in popularity for narghile smoking. In addition to providing the pleasing aroma and taste, Maasel also simplifies the process of narghile preparation in comparison to the more complex process of preparing the traditional Ajami.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory {{memory has}} also been {{developed}} throughout evolution to help animals recognize other animals. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> allows for young infants to identify with their mothers or for humans to identify between males and females. Olfaction cues were also used, and are still used, by many animals to mark territory, protecting themselves from other threats to their survival. While the development of other sensory systems, such as the visual system and auditory systems, has decreased how reliant some animals are on the olfactory system, there is still evidence that shows these animals’ olfactory systems still have a strong influence on their social interactions. The memory for specific odorants gives the animal an opportunity to communicate {{with members of the}} same species and allows for lack of communication between species that do not have the proper receptor systems for the odor. These chemical signals can also be sensed in the dark or even under water.|$|E
500|$|In what Inglis {{describes}} as a [...] "poignant contrast" [...] with the composer's Beatles track [...] "Here Comes the Sun", Harrison sings that the sunshine brings him no relief, but instead leaves him [...] "suffering in the darkness", which is [...] "so easy come by on the roadside of one long lifetime". In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison says of the mood he captured in the song: [...] "it's <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> and the whole atmosphere of doom that's in those hospitals." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, {{it made me feel}} a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E

500|$|There are no endemic {{plant species}} but the {{relative}} {{isolation of the}} island has allowed a number of hardy species such as bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) to thrive. There are also a number of relatively rare plants, such as rock sea-lavender (Limonium binervosum), and wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). The leek grows to [...] and Flat Holm {{is one of only}} five places in the UK where it is found. Related to the onion, the leek has a bulb that grows for several years producing only leaves, then blooms with large purple flowers <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> of garlic. After flowering the bulb dies and produces up to 150 bulblets.|$|E
2500|$|A true entrepreneur, Winston {{describes}} {{sewage and}} septic sucking as his lifelong dream. He owns his own equipment and a septic truck—apparently his {{only means of}} transportation, even on his usually unsuccessful dates. Throughout the series, he appears {{in a wide variety}} of commercials advertising his septic sucking business, almost always with a humorous quip ("We're number one in the number two business"; [...] "We'll take <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> off your hands";"We come in a truck and leave in a day" [...] etc.). In later episodes, his commercials tend to parody the advertising campaigns of numerous Canadian companies.|$|E
2500|$|Fishes {{can also}} learn from others the {{identity}} of predatory species. Fathead minnows, for example, can learn the smell of a predatory pike just by being simultaneously exposed to <b>that</b> <b>smell</b> {{and the sight of}} experienced minnows reacting with fear, and brook stickleback can learn the visual identity of a predator by watching the fright reaction of experienced fathead minnows. [...] Fish can also learn to recognize the odor of dangerous sites when they are simultaneously exposed to it and to other fish that suddenly show a fright reaction. [...] Hatchery-raised salmon can learn the smell of a predator by being simultaneously exposed to it and to the alarm substance released by injured salmon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Buechner's time in Bermuda has, however, {{manifested}} {{in other respects}} in his writing and in his life. [...] While he often refers to {{the natural beauty of}} Bermuda's island landscape—the [...] "unutterable, blinding blue-green flash of the ocean" [...] and its [...] "unkempt greenness"—and its idyllic island charms—the [...] "narrow-gauge Toonerville Trolley of a railway with wicker armchairs for seats" [...] and the pastel houses [...] "with their blinding white roofs stepped to catch the rain"—the distinctly British flavor of pre-World War II Bermuda also instilled in him an enduring love of English custom and culture. [...] Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of [...] "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them." [...] Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him: [...] "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore that smelled the way a new book printed in England does when you first open it." [...] <b>That</b> <b>smell,</b> [...] "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," [...] stayed with Buechner the rest of his life. Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates [...] "helped drag brushwood {{to the top of a}} hill for a bonfire" [...] and went around [...] "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda"—appear throughout his memoirs. [...] Thus, in The Eyes of the Heart, Buechner recalls the [...] "royal governor who on state occasions such as the coronation of George VI wore a cocked hat with white plumes on it like the captain of the Pinafore." ...|$|E
