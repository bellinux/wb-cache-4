25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 0), {{and if there is a}} carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} given a budget of $100 million (£58 million), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between March 2004 and July 2005, at {{locations}} in or around Rome, and on a set considered [...] "to be {{the biggest and most}} expensive ever built for television." [...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He said, People think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think it was like that at all. If you go to Pompeii, you're struck by how garish it is, even now. The temples and sculptures were all brightly painted. Rome was like Pompeii, but much bigger. And Rome was so noisy it was impossible to sleep. It was like hell. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> combination of New York and Calcutta, with insane wealth and insane poverty. It was pretty extreme.|$|E

500|$|The task of {{developing}} the new game was given to FreeStyleGames around 2012. FreeStyleGames had developed both DJ Hero and DJ Hero 2, and while both games were critically praised, the latter was released on the downward trend of the music game genre. FreeStyleGames had suffered some layoffs {{as a result of}} the hiatus of the Guitar Hero series, though remained an Activision studio and financially viable due to their work for the Wii U Sing Party. As the development of Sing Party wrapped up, the studio created an internal research and development department to begin brainstorming what their next game would, with input from Activision. Hirshberg had encouraged the team to reconsider Guitar Hero, noting the fan dedication to the series, but noted that the game needed innovation to be successful. Activision gave the team freedom to develop the game without relying on the previous titles in the series. The core gameplay of Guitar Hero Live was rebuilt from scratch; developer Jamie Jackson explained that the goal of the game was to bring [...] "big innovation" [...] to the franchise rather than continue with the same format used by previous games. He explained to his staff to only [...] "think of [...] as a name. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> music game with a guitar peripheral, but pretend that nothing else has ever been done." [...] The team brainstormed on what had made the Guitar Hero series fun, and recounted the earlier titles of the series which were designed to enable the player to envision themselves as a superstar guitarist, subsequent design choices were made around recreating that experience. The team also cited fellow Activison franchise Call of Duty as an influence towards the goal of providing an immersive, first-person experience.|$|E

2500|$|The Herald {{published}} {{a story on}} May 3 that Hart had spent Friday night and most of Saturday with {{a young woman in}} his Washington, D.C. townhouse. On that same day, in an interview with E. J. Dionne that appeared in the New York Times, Hart, responding to the rumors of his womanizing, said: [...] "Follow me around. I don't care. I'm serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'll be very bored." [...] The Heralds reporters at some point learned that the New York Times was planning to feature the story with the quote on Sunday, incorporated it into their story, and the two articles appearing on the same day ignited a political firestorm. On Sunday, Hart's campaign denied any scandal and condemned the Heralds reporters for intrusive reporting. [...] Hart later noted that his [...] "follow me around" [...] comment was not [...] "challenging the press with a taunt", but, made in frustration, was only intended to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and [...] never intended to invite reporters to be [...] "skulking around in the shadows" [...] of his home. [...] '“He did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge,” Dionne would recall many years later. “And at the time, I did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge.”' [...] Nor did Hart's comment influence the Miami Herald to pursue the story.|$|E

2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E

The German magazine Der Spiegel reported in 2008 that Rodriguez Chacín was a frequent guest at FARC camps in Colombia and that Hugo Chávez had assigned him the task of managing communications with FARC. In September 2008, The U.S. Department of the Treasury accused Rodriguez Chacín of materially assisting FARC's narcotics trafficking activities. The Venezuelan government responded to these allegations saying he was not guilty of those charges. US intelligence officials claimed that in an email between Rodriguez Chacín and the FARC leadership, [...] Rodriguez Chacín asked to train Venezuela's military in guerrilla tactics as preparation in case the United States invaded the area.

2500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "while failing to {{transform}} the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't {{have to rely on}} the film license to pull it along." [...] GameSpy's William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; [...] "where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is all about the violence." [...] He wrote [...] "Being a Godfather game, you'd expect things to be a bit less [...] "insane" [...] than your run-of-the-mill Grand Theft Auto clone. But there's more gunplay, more Blues Brothers-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy." [...] He concluded [...] "if you can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, you can certainly have a good time. That said, it's hard to play The Godfather without thinking that this was a missed opportunity." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of Grand Theft Auto to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering." [...] Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; [...] "the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition." [...] He argued the game [...] "offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening." ...|$|E
