25|$|The λ-red {{system has}} also been {{optimized}} for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of mutagenesis. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to <b>transfect</b> linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E
25|$|Electrical pulses {{are also}} used to intracellularly deliver siRNA into cells. The cell {{membrane}} is made of phospholipids which makes it susceptible to an electric field. When quick but powerful electrical pulses are initiated the lipid molecules reorient themselves, while undergoing thermal phase transitions because of heating. This results {{in the making of}} hydrophilic pores and localized perturbations in the lipid bilayer cell membrane also causing a temporary loss of semipermeability. This allows for the escape of many intracellular contents, such as ions and metabolites as well as the simultaneous uptake of drugs, molecular probes, and nucleic acids. For cells that are difficult to <b>transfect</b> electroporation is advantageous however cell death is more probable under this technique.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>transfected</b> hTERT gene on cell apoptosis of newborn rat cochlear basilar membrane cells (CBMCs). MethodsCBMCs isolated from newborn rat cochlear were <b>transfected</b> using a plasmid containing human telomerase reverase transcriptase gene (pCI-neo-hTERT), and were screened using G 418 to obtain stable <b>transfected</b> cell lines. Cell apoptosis rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. hTERT and apoptosis related genes expression were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ResultshTERT gene expression was detected 72 after gene transfection in <b>transfected</b> cells. The apoptotic rate of <b>transfected</b> CBMCs significantly reduced. Expression of apoptosis related genes correspondingly changed. ConclusionTransfection of hTERT gene leads to reduced apoptosis rate in newborn rat CBMCs. and lower expression of apaf 1, Caspase 3 and BCL 2 in <b>transfected</b> cells as compared to that of normal CBMCs...|$|R

We analyzed the production of TGF-β and TGF-β 1 binding proteins in <b>transfected</b> and parental cells. TGF-β-like activity released in the medium was reduced in c-fos expressing cells. TGF-β 1 binding sites were more numerous in <b>transfected</b> cells (× 3). Cross-linking studies confirmed that c-fos <b>transfected</b> cells showed increased binding of 125 I-TGF-β 1 to membrane binding sites corresponding to type I, II and III receptors. <b>Transfected</b> cells internalized and degraded 125 I-TGF-β 1 more rapidly than parental cells. TGF-β 1 incubation rapidly down-regulated the receptors. In parental cells, the down-regulation was total, while in <b>transfected</b> cells, a few binding proteins could still be detected.

40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the regulation of}} epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colon cancer cells by Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl 2) knockdown. Methods 　Human colon cancer cells HT- 29 and LS 174 T, were <b>transfected</b> with shRNAAscl 2 vector, then the <b>transfected</b> cells were selected with G 418 and stably <b>transfected</b> cell lines were established. MTT assay and colony formation experiment were used to observe the effects of Ascl 2 RNA interference on cell proliferation and colony formation ability. Real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis were used to detect the expression of E-cadherin and Vimentin mRNAs and proteins. Results 　MTT assay found that the cell proliferation rate of HT- 29 and LS 174 T cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-Ascl 2 vector was {{significantly lower than the}} cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-control vector and the untransfected cells 72 and 96 hours later after inoculation (P< 0. 05). The colony formation experiment indicated that the colony formation numbers of HT- 29 and LS 174 T cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-Ascl 2 vector was significantly less than the cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-control vector and the untransfected cells 20 days after inoculation. The expression levels (mRNA and protein) of E-cadherin in HT- 29 and LS 174 T cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-Ascl 2 vector was significantly higher than the cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-control vector and the untransfected cells (P< 0. 05). The expression levels (mRNA and protein) of Vimentin in HT- 29 and LS 174 T cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-Ascl 2 vector was significantly lower than the cells <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-control vector and the untransfected cells (P< 0. 05). Conclusions 　Ascl 2 RNA interference leads to the reduction of proliferative capacity of HT- 29 and LS 174 T cells, and it {{may be related to the}} reversal of epithelial-mesenchvmal transition...|$|R
25|$|The gene {{silencing}} effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty {{can be overcome}} through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and lentivirus. The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is {{that in some cases}} synthetic viral vectors can integrate shRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to <b>transfect</b> cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.|$|E
2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection {{and this will be}} an important disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method. In Osteoarthritis gene therapy, ex vivo method makes it possible to <b>transfect</b> not only the cells of the synovial lining of joints but also articular chondrocytes and chondroprogenitor cells in cartilage.|$|E

The wild and <b>transfected</b> cells were examined {{for the presence of}} IGF-I and MHC-I molecules.

40|$|The {{inducibility}} of stably <b>transfected</b> alpha-cardiac actin genes differs among L cell clones. We {{examined the}} ability of muscle-specific factors to induce {{the expression of the}} human muscle alpha-cardiac actin gene promoter when stably <b>transfected</b> into mouse fibroblast L cells. This promoter is transcriptionally active in L cells at a low level, 2 - 5 % of that in <b>transfected</b> muscle cells. Upon fusion with muscle cells to form heterokaryons, expression of the <b>transfected</b> alpha- cardiac actin gene promoter can be induced. However, induction is observed with only 10 % of <b>transfected</b> L cell clones and the magnitude of this induction varies between 5 - and 50 -fold. These properties of the <b>transfected</b> L cell appear to be stably inherited. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that muscle cells contain factors capable of increasing the transcription of the <b>transfected</b> gene, but that differences among L cell clones, possibly in the site of integration in the genome, {{determine the extent to which}} the gene can respond. By fusion into heterokaryons, transfectants with responsive genes can be identified. Such clones should prove useful in determining the basis for clonal variation.
