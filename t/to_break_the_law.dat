5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E

The term [...] "Poitevins" [...] became loosely applied to this grouping, although many came from Anjou and other parts of France, and by the 1250s there was a fierce rivalry between the relatively well established Savoyards and the newly arrived Poitevins. The Lusignans began <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> with impunity, pursuing personal grievances against other barons and the Savoyards, and Henry took little or no action to restrain them.

Moreover, the Pentagon Papers were historical, whereas the hydrogen bomb was a current military weapon. Finally, they pointed out that the government had obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty not to assist non-nuclear states in acquiring nuclear weapons.

50|$|Duress has two aspects.

500|$|Lay and Heaney {{were the}} sole dissenters, and wrote {{separate}} opinions based upon two different grounds. The former argued that Jacobson had {{not in fact}} shown [...] "predisposition" [...] toward breaking the law throughout his life, since the only known prior purchases and basis for belief by prosecutors, were purchases he had made at a time this was a legal act; Lay therefore concluded that without evidence of prior disposition <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in this way, he had been entrapped. The latter's dissent {{was similar to the}} original panel opinion, arguing that the government had no reasonable belief that Jacobson would purchase child pornography. He also called investigative tactics sufficiently outrageous to justify reversal: [...] "In my view, the government's investigation and prosecution of Jacobson amount to the deliberate manufacture of a crime that would never have occurred but for the Postal Service's overzealous efforts to create it".|$|E
