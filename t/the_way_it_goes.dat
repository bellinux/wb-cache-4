[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E

He was called up to the England U21 squad in December 1997 for a 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship {{qualification}} play-off game against Greece, but remained an unused substitute. After the game, he said: [...] "My chances with England are virtually gone now..I am ready if Jamaica come in for me. I was hoping for a game on Wednesday – and I still {{might have had a}} chance with England had they qualified for the last eight but that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> I have enjoyed the experience of being with England but I am hoping to hear from Jamaica." [...] Johnson played his first senior international football in 1998, making a nine-minute cameo for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle in a 4–1 victory over Russia at Loftus Road.|$|E

I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's just hard racing.

[...] Sanchez would be proven right by ESPN's SportsCenter. Every Friday, SportsCenter has a [...] "Not Top-10" [...] blooper reel segment, culminating in the [...] "Worst of the Worst" [...] play, which is voted on by fans online. The butt fumble won Worst of the Worst for 40 straight weeks, usually by a landslide. Anchor Jay Crawford compared the lowlight with the Stanford Band's involvement in The Play during the 1982 Cal–Stanford Big Game, and with Jean van de Velde's meltdown at the 1999 Open Championship. Anchor Kevin Negandhi listed the ingredients {{that contribute to the}} play's longevity: it features a celebrity on a well-known team making an embarrassing mistake that is immediately punished by the opposing team scoring, and the comedic [...] "butt fumble" [...] nickname completes [...] "the perfect storm." ...|$|E
2500|$|The deal {{generated}} controversy after Canadian channel TSN {{had announced}} that the trade was complete, then claimed that the Flames had balked at completing the deal, believing they would need their players for a scheduled game. Consequently, Jokinen appeared in his final game with the Flames knowing through the media {{that he was to}} be traded afterward. When the trade was officially made, Jokinen bluntly described his feelings on the deal: [...] "It’s a brutal business. That’s <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> It comes with the salary. When you make $5 million, 11 goals is not going to cut it. ... It’s definitely {{a slap in the face}} to get traded." [...] Jokinen scored 15 points in 21 games with the Rangers. In the final game of the season, New York faced the Philadelphia Flyers with the winner qualifying for the final playoff spot. Regulation time ended with the two teams tied, and the game ultimately went to a shootout. Jokinen came up as the Rangers' final shooter, with Philadelphia leading by one goal. His shot was stopped by Brian Boucher, ending their season.|$|E

[...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer {{was in the midst}} of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E

Starring Robert De Niro, the movie garnered tremendous critical acclaim and emerged as a cult classic. Over the years many directors have been inspired by its style and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> about constructing a psychological study of a man leading a life shrouded by disturbing elements, or rather deconstructing the psychological state of disturbed man finding it difficult to come to terms with his environs.|$|R

60|$|He sought {{forgetfulness}} in Mr. Gay. He had the delicate-minded man's inherent {{taste for}} verse, a quick ear for the melody of words, the aesthete's love of beauty in phrase as of beauty in all else; and culture had quickened his perceptions, developed his capacity for appreciation.

I work my {{territory}} jus' as hard as I ever did, but I can't meet the competition of the floor-wax people. They're making an auto polish now--better article at a lower price--and what can I do? They got a full line, varnish, cleaner, polish, swell window displays, national advertising, swell discounts--everything; and I can't buck competition like that. And then a lot of the salesmen at our shop are jealous of me, and one thing and another. Well, now I'll go down and spit the old man in the eye couple o' times, and get canned, unless I can talk him out of his bad acting. Oh, I'll throw a big bluff. I'll be the little misunderstood boy, but I don't honestly think I can put anything across on him. I'm-- Oh, hell, I guess I'm getting old. I ain't got the pep I used to have. Not but what J. Eddie Schwirtz can still sell goods, but I can't talk up to the boss like I could once. I gotta feel some sympathy at the home office.

I put on a Worth frock, and mamma would make me put on a Worth spirit, if she could. I do my best to conform, because it's the bargain, and I'll keep my word if it kills me. Now you see what a double life I lead! If I could only be steeped in hopeless poverty to the lips! If I could have a room like this, even! Sometimes I'm so bewildered by the twofold existence I'm leading, I don't really know what I'm saying. Those your things, of course?"

6000|$|... "Every time a woman {{wants to}} do well by her darling, she puzzles her brain to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands. Why, sir, a woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of {{complexion}} (and so had the woman), and swore {{that the child was}} mine and she my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I could not remember her name. Well, sir, she called my {{attention to the fact that}} the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble me--a common thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put it in my nursery, and she left. And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when they came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun! Bless my soul, you don't know anything about married life. It is a perfect dog's life, sir--a perfect dog's life. You can't economize. It isn't possible. I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions. But it is of no use. First you'll marry a combination of calico and consumption that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll get a creature that's nothing more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you've got to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon. That is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> And think of the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and eighty-four pieces a week! No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy in a family like mine. Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it! And vermifuge! Soothing syrup! Teething rings! And 'papa's watches' for the babies to play with! And things to scratch the furniture with! And lucifer matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves with! The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to say, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as fast as I feel I ought to, with my opportunities. Bless you, sir, at a time when I had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out the whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet long and ninety-six feet wide. But it was a failure, sir. I could not sleep. It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once. The roar was deafening. And then the danger of it! That was what I was looking at. They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could actually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all exhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and strain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together. My friend, take an old man's advice, and don't encumber yourself with a large family--mind, I tell you, don't do it. In a small family, and in a small family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford us, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no acquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us. Take my word for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over it." ...|$|E
