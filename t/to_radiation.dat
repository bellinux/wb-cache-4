40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the University of the Witwatersrand in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Medicine Johannesburg 2014 Animals can shift their orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> <b>to</b> adjust the amount of body surface area that is exposed <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> thereby manipulating the amount of radiant heat they absorb from their environment. This behaviour is especially important in animals that need to graze {{out in the open}} during the day, such as wild ungulates. All previous studies of orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> in animals have relied on visual observations. The problem with visual observations is that animal behaviour, including animal orientation, can be affected by human presence. Therefore I set out to develop a remote technique to detect and quantify orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> in wildebeest <b>to</b> eliminate the need of a human observer. I hypothesised that if an animal was orientated perpendicular <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> the side facing the sun would be hotter than the opposite side. In contrast, if the animal was orientated parallel <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> I hypothesised that both sides will have a similar temperature. To test my hypothesis, temperature-sensitive data loggers were implanted subcutaneously into free-ranging black (Connochaetes gnou) and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) from Mokala National Park and their orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> was determined visually. I found that when wildebeest were orientated perpendicular <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> there was a greater difference between the left and right subcutaneous temperature than when wildebeest were orientated parallel <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> (t 7 = 2. 5, p= 0. 04). However, using subcutaneous temperature difference on its own to predict orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> could not account for how the previous orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation</b> of wildebeest affected subcutaneous temperature patterns. Therefore, I designed a prediction model incorporating both subcutaneous temperature difference and rate of change in subcutaneous temperature difference to determine orientation <b>to</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> The prediction model was accurate more often than expected by chance (60...|$|R

Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
