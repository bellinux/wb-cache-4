40|$|Background: Postural {{alterations}} of the shoulders, dorsal {{spine and}} hips {{could have an}} influence {{on the development of}} craniomandibular dysfunctions. Aim: To study the influence of body posture on the prevalence of craniomandibular dysfunction. Subjects and methods: One hundred thirty six dental students and 41 patients assisting to the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) clinic at the Freie Universität at Berlin, were studied. Masticator, cervical muscles, temporomandibular joints and occlusions were clinically examined. The position of shoulders and hips was measured with the use of an acromiopelvimeter. Results: No relationship was found between postural alterations of the hips and shoulders, articular noises and <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> pain while palpating the temporomandibular joints. Among students, a relationship between postural alterations of the shoulders and <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> pain while palpating the TMJ, was observed. When all muscles were considered, a significant relationship between asymmetric shoulders or hips and muscular pain while palpating was observed among students. Conclusions: Some symptoms, especially muscular sensibility is more pronounced in people with hip and shoulder asymmetries. This relation is more pronounced in dental students than in patients...|$|R

Due to <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> specificity limitation of Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP), a cluster lncRNAs were revealed as fingerprints for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we enrolled all the reported circulating lncRNAs in HCC as candidate targets and examined in an independent cohort. Methods: The candidate lncRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR divided into training and validation sets. The risk score analysis was employed to evaluate the potential diagnosis ability of the lncRNAs independently or combining with AFP value. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied for presentation of <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> specificity. Results: Among the ten candidate circulating lncRNA, LINC 00152, RP 11 - 160 H 22. 5, XLOC 014172 and LOC 149086 were screened with significant difference in training set. Further investigation in validation set indicated LINC 00152, RP 11 - 160 H 22. 5 and XLOC 014172 might be the fingerprints for HCC comparing with chronic hepatitis (CH) patients or healthy controls. The risk score analysis revealed the combination of three lncRNAs with AFP could distinguish the HCC from either CH or healthy control with the area under curve value (AUC) of 0. 986 and 0. 985, respectively. Conclusion: The three lncRNAs may act as novel biomarkers for acting as fingerprint in HCC combining with AFP...|$|R
40|$|The authors examined, through content analysis, some criticisms {{that have}} been {{levelled}} at the press in its coverage of crime. The propositions examined included the accusations that newspapers are preoccupied with violence and “street” crime, that they focus on the bizarre, are superficial in their reporting of crime, misinform {{the public about the}} characteristics of offenders and victims, and exhibit a conservative bias in their analysis. This study of a major Canadian daily newspaper revealed substantiation for some of these claims but failed to support others. Violent and street crimes received disproportionate coverage and very few articles contained an in-depth analysis of the roots of crime or the workings of the criminal justice system. The evidence was less clear or non-existent in relation to the claims that the press focus on nonroutine events, that they provide distorted images of offenders and victims and that they have a conservative bent.

Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship, and that the convergence of documentary evidence used to support Shakespeare's authorship—title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records—is the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era. No such direct evidence exists for any other candidate, and Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.|$|R

5000|$|The main recent {{sense of}} the word [...] "art" [...] is roughly as an {{abbreviation}} for creative art or [...] "fine art." [...] Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage <b>the</b> audience's aesthetic <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>or</b> to draw <b>the</b> audience towards consideration of the [...] "finer" [...] things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a craft instead of art, a suggestion which is highly disputed by many Contemporary Craft thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered design instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called applied art. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art {{has more to do with}} the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference. Art usually implies no function other than to convey or communicate an idea.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{present study}} aims to test, under {{different}} simulated anatomic circumstances the sensitivity and reproducibility of the T‐Scan®III HD sensor (T‐Scan® Tekscan Incorporation, Boston, USA), the newest generation of a computerized occlusal analysis device. MethodsFour different occlusal tables were created: two of 120 ° represented by an artificial inferior first molar either {{embedded in a}} periodontal‐ligament‐simulator or not; one of 100 ° (simulating the occlusion of anterior teeth) and a plane surface (180 °) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied, 40 times each, by a universal testing machine (Autograph®, AG‐I) with a spherical bur (diameter= 2. 2 mm) on the sensor film. One‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons. ResultsAccording to our study, 85 % of the outliers are within the 5 first closures, representing the conditioning time required by the initially flat sensor. Graphically and statistically sustained differences (p< 0. 05) in the recorded data could only be found when the sensor's position was switched between closures, {{but not in the}} other circumstances. ConclusionsAn undeniable improvement of the T‐Scan®III HD system as compared to former designs could be shown. The anatomic circumstances did not influence <b>the</b> sensor's <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> reproducibility. However, further studies on the varying sensitivity throughout its sensing surface are required. Its reproducibility could be proved, except for the 5 first values (outliers to the mean values), which shall be used as a conditioning time to both the sensor and the patient...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Bakground Knowledge: Baclofen pump {{treatment}} is used with patients with spasms and spasticity. The pump is implanted subcutaneous on the abdomen, and a spinal catheter continuously delivers the medication to the cerebrospinal fluid. Current practice is to implant the pump with an angular incision. Hypothesis: In this project we have examined {{patients with a}} baclofen pump {{with a view to}} the impact of the incision to <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> over <b>the</b> pump. Our hypothesis was that the angular incision cut through nerves in the skin, so that <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> to stings over the skin area punctured while filling the pump was reduced, which would lead to less discomfort for the patients when filling-up. Material and Method: We examined patients who came for a routine check-up at the neurological policlinic at Rikshospitalet. All the patients were asked to participate in the study, 9 was excluded, 7 declined, and 23 were included in the study. <b>The</b> patients’ <b>sensibility</b> was examined for 3 modalities; temperature, touch, and sting. We examined proximally and distally around the incision, in addition to {{the opposite side of the}} stomach/abdomen in order to have a reference sensibility. Results: Only 6 patients had <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> outcome that we had expected they would get, with a clear reduced <b>sensibility</b> distally by <b>the</b> incision. The remaining either had unchanged <b>sensibility</b> <b>or</b> loss of <b>sensibility</b> that could not be related to the incision. Discussion: The patients’ diagnosis and time of implantation were dissimilar, however, we did not find a correlation between the different results and the different diagnoses or time of surgery. The peripheral neurones have a considerable ability of regeneration. This could indeed help explain that the cutting of the nerves in the skin during surgery seems to be of limited value. Conclusion: Our conclusion is that the value of the angular incision seems to be limited and that one should adjust the incision to each patient’s wishes, needs and anatomy...|$|R

40|$|Privileged Sensibilities” {{argues that}} <b>the</b> rhetoric of <b>sensibility</b> was {{essential}} to constructing ideas about racial difference and nationhood in the early Republic. Broadly, I demonstrate how in early national literature emerging value-laden descriptions of phenotype existed in tension with Scottish Enlightenment theories of sensibility and of humankind 2 ̆ 7 s development though stages, or conjectural history. Both theories overlooked physical appearance to define human value in terms of emotional and moral sophistication. Many literary scholars have examined the prominent place of sympathy in abolitionist rhetoric and debates over Indian removal. Fewer scholars, however, have attended to how <b>the</b> recourse to <b>sensibility,</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> capacities for feeling, moral judgment and action, and aesthetic assessment, served to restructure racial formations and, in the process, to increase notions of racial fluidity. I contend that in the country 2 ̆ 7 s first three decades, U. S. writers interwove discourses of sensibility, phenotype, and historical progress to erect the United States as the ideal of cultivated whiteness. Portraying the new nation as neither savagely rude nor decadently over-civilized, authors sought to figure it as the domain of privileged <b>sensibilities,</b> <b>the</b> preeminent example of tender feeling and morality in the modern world. Yet in their endeavor to broadcast an exceptionally sophisticated national sense of virtue in relation to differently racialized populations both within the country and abroad, white U. S. writers often drew distinctions among a citizenry holding conflicting interests. Frequently, they fashioned analogies across racial and national divides to redraw political battle lines within the early Republic itself. Looking at texts composed during conflicts waged on the turn-of-the-century U. S. political landscape, I show, for example, how Federalists compared Republicans to self-serving, vicious Jews and French Jacobins, and how Republicans likened Federalists to tyrannical, morally vitiated Barbary despots. Tracking sensibility 2 ̆ 7 s role in describing human difference in the new nation reveals an era characterized by unstable racial hierarchies that would only realize greater fixity in the later decades of the nineteenth century. It also shows that sensibility, a capacity that allegedly cohered society and indeed humanity, also called into question the United States 2 ̆ 7 ability to achieve emotional and moral harmony. ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the {{eleventh}} century that the effects of the poetry of the Christian and chivalric systems began to manifest themselves. The principle of equality had been discovered and applied by Plato in his Republic, as the theoretical rule of the mode in which the materials of pleasure and of power, produced by the common skill and labour of human beings, ought to be distributed among them. The limitations of this rule were asserted by him to be determined only by <b>the</b> <b>sensibility</b> of each, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> utility to result to all. Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and Pythagoras, taught also a moral and intellectual system of doctrine, comprehending at once the past, the present, and the future condition of man. Jesus Christ divulged the sacred and eternal truths contained in these views to mankind, and Christianity, in its abstract purity, became the exoteric expression of the esoteric doctrines of the poetry and wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of the Celtic nations with the exhausted population of the south, impressed upon it the figure of the poetry existing in their mythology and institutions. The result was a sum of the action and reaction of all the causes included in it; for it may be assumed as a maxim that no nation or religion can supersede any other without incorporating into itself a portion of that which it supersedes. The abolition of personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation of women from a great part of the degrading restraints of antiquity, were among the consequences of these events.|$|R
