He later stated in a debate that he would have signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E
5|$|The {{progenitors}} of Type Ib/c supernovae are {{not observed}} at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often {{lower than those}} of known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed Type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal Type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly-rotating massive stars, likely corresponding to the highly-energetic Type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
50|$|However, by 1971/1972 {{the market}} had already shown signs of weakening, and, unfortunately, {{subsequent}} global events {{had a lot}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about <b>whether</b> that rosy forecast would come true.|$|R

50|$|The {{most widely}} {{prevailing}} view {{on how to}} best account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality.

50|$|Wambaugh {{devised the}} eponymous Wambaugh's Inversion Test, which {{provides}} that {{to determine whether}} a judicial statement in a common law case is ratio or obiter, you should invert the argument, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> ask <b>whether</b> the decision would have been the different, had the statement been omitted. If so, the statement is crucial and is ratio; whereas if it is not crucial, it is obiter.|$|R
25|$|It is {{a notable}} {{fact that it}} was in Izhevsk in 1994 that one of the first Slavic Rodnover communities, the Tur, first appeared.

50|$|In any case, by 1 Ma, hominins {{had settled}} {{in most of the}} Old World.

Early Acheulean tools at Ubeidiya from 1.4 Ma is some evidence for a continuous settlement in the West, as successive waves out of Africa after then would likely have brought Acheulean technology to Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> clearly <b>whether</b> a particular image {{should be regarded as}} a Lamentation or one of the other related subjects discussed above, and museums and art historians are not always consistent in their naming. The famous Mantegna painting, clearly motivated by an interest in foreshortening, is essentially an Anointing, and many scenes, especially Italian Trecento ones and those after 1500, share characteristics of the Lamentation and the Entombment.|$|R

25|$|Nipple {{stimulation}} and breastfeeding {{triggers the}} release of natural oxytocin in the body, therefore {{it is thought that}} encouraging the baby to suckle soon after birth may reduce the risk of PPH for the mother.

25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on the issue of what exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> the Bucci case is still good law. However, because {{there have been so many}} divergent opinions and fact specific determinations from subsequent cases, it is not likely that the case would be strictly followed by other courts.|$|E
60|$|Miss Halcombe, {{after looking}} at me very earnestly, said a few words, on her side, to the same effect--with a certain {{hesitation}} of manner, however, which the circumstances {{did not seem to}} me to warrant.

25|$|Other {{theories}} suggest Donati's death resulted {{more directly}} from specific crimes {{he was engaged}} in. Some reports suggest he was an occasional informant to authorities and thus was killed for that reason; In 1997, a federal prosecutor who had been threatened with contempt of court charges if he refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> Donati was an informant told a judge {{that he had not}} been, at least not to any federal agencies.

In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.|$|E

25|$|An inquest {{into his}} death was held at Westminster Coroner's Court on 26 February 2013. The jury {{returned}} a verdict of accidental death. Those who gave evidence included his Surrey teammates Jade Dernbach and Rory Hamilton-Brown, {{who had been with}} him earlier in the evening of his death. The post-mortem on Maynard revealed that he was nearly four times over the legal drink-drive limit and had also taken cocaine and ecstasy in the form of MDMA. A forensic pathologist said that it was not possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> electrocution or being hit by the train was the cause of death.|$|E
25|$|In Transylvania, the Celts {{shifted from}} inhumation to cremation, either through natural {{progression}} {{or because of}} Dacian influence. Almost without exception, the necropoleis so far studied are bi-ritual, although cremation {{appears to be more}} prevalent than inhumation. The Celts in Dacia certainly cremated their dead from the second La Tène period onwards but Celtic inhumations appear no older than pit-grave cremations in any of the cemeteries. It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> the Celts turned away from the practice of cremation as the Scythians had. Although less frequent, inhumation still occurred as a constant practice even during the final stage of Celtic inhabitation of this territory.|$|E

All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
