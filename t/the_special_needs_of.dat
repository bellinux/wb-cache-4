25|$|In {{terms of}} family {{guidelines}} and agreements, corporate policies exclusively refer to marriages among {{women and men}} and thereby disregard the situation and <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> non-traditional families. These non-traditional families often consist of couples or individuals with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) backgrounds that are increasingly under pressure of the community, as their needs within corporations are often paid inadequate attention. Exclusive behavior such as creating environments that do not encourage LGBTs to disclose their sexual orientation, or even neglecting the fact that LGBT are allowed to adopt children, leads to a feeling of isolation and job stress that ultimately negatively effects the WLB of the affected individuals.|$|E
25|$|An Act of January 1984 {{asserted}} a {{right for}} all parents {{to benefit from}} a parental leave of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year’s seniority. This legislation also allowed parents (under the same conditions) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave. In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity. For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures {{must be taken to}} accommodate <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years' service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract. The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.|$|E

The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7.

Findings showed that raising children with disabilities reduced the time working mothers had for leisure activities, but increased the time for socializing activities.

40|$|Abstract. The markup {{approach}} to represent and store large corpora of annotated textual documents is criticized for several reasons: it poses problems in expressing non-hierarchical structures, it limits the annota-tions in type and complexity, it makes difficult {{the writing of}} complex textual analysis programs since it {{requires the use of}} generic query lan-guages like XQuery which are not well suited to <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain. We present a model and a language, called Manuzio, developed to be {{at the base of a}} new generation of textual document management systems which overcome the previous shortcomings. The model is an ob-ject based one, specialized for the specific domain, and has abstraction mechanisms which present some similarities with those of the object ori-ented database models. The language has query facilities and allows the development of sophisticated textual analysis applications. A prototype for a system has been designed and applied to several test cases. ...|$|R
