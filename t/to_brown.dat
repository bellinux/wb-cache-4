5000|$|Sporangiophores bearing sporangiola are erect, hyaline, unbranched, and apically dilated {{to form a}} clavate vesicle, {{from which}} arise dichotomously branched, {{distally}} clavate secondary vesicles. The sporangioles are indehiscent, ellipsoid, <b>brown</b> <b>to</b> dark <b>brown</b> with distinct longitudinal striations and measure 12-20μm x 6-12μm. Sporangia are multispored, spherical, initially white <b>to</b> yellow, pale <b>brown</b> <b>to</b> dark <b>brown</b> at maturity and measure 40-160μm.

5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries <b>to</b> <b>brown</b> or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
5|$|Sliced apples turn {{brown with}} {{exposure}} to air {{due to the}} conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars vary in their propensity <b>to</b> <b>brown</b> after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit can be treated with acidulated water to prevent this effect. Sliced apple consumption tripled in the US from 2004 to 2014 to 500 million apples annually due to its convenience.|$|E

5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} <b>to</b> <b>brown,</b> grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or hypoxia. Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturæ in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos.

He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant <b>to</b> <b>Brown,</b> who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached a football team there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval dental officer.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan <b>to</b> <b>brown</b> with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E

5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine.

The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
