40|$|It {{is argued}} that from the {{viewpoint}} of efficiency, agriculture should not be taxed relative to other sectors, and neither should it be favored. Nevertheless, developing countries have traditionally taxed the agricultural sector while developed countries have protected it, and both have incurred efficiency losses. Based on Schiff and Valdes (1992), it was shown that the taxation of agriculture in developing countries resulted in a slowdown in agricultural growth and in overall economic growth, and that the slowdown was caused essentially by indirect taxation policies (industrial and macroeconomic policies) rather than by the direct (sectoral) ones. A number of LDCs have undertaken structural adjustment reforms in the last fifteen years, including trade policy reform and stabilization efforts, and this has reduced the level of indirect <b>taxation.</b> One <b>reason</b> often given for direct taxion of agriculture is to keep food prices low for urban consumers and to obtain export tax revenue. However, the poorest are often located in the rural areas rather than in the cities, and it is preferable to use non-price instruments to attain social or distributional objectives. As for export tax revenues, LDCs who depen...|$|R
40|$|Countries with a {{low income}} most often {{experience}} the coexistence of a very low rate of tax pressure (relation between tax incomes and gross domestic product) and a very high rate of <b>taxation.</b> The main <b>reason</b> behind this paradoxical situation lies {{in the existence of}} both a taxation system which leaves much to be desired, and a very high rate of informal and/or clandestine practices that render the collection of various taxes owed by taxpayers particularly difficult in these countries. The governments have misguidedly raised taxation rates in an effort to increase their tax revenue. In fact, it has never been the case since these increases have on the contrary initiated in secret certain outdated modern and regularly imposed practices. This article is aimed at enacting a model taxation system for activities relating to the poll tax. It is the implementation of this model that will encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes without pressure. A few economic policies have been formulated regarding the collection of poll tax. Dontsi.

40|$|In Germany {{property}} <b>taxation</b> was the <b>reason</b> for {{the establishment}} of the cadaster {{in the beginning of the}} 19 th century. One hundred years later (1900) the property cadaster was established. In the last decades the cadaster was increasingly used for a lot of other mapping and planning issues- it became a so called multi-purpose cadaster as a geo-basis Land Information System (LIS) and nowadays as a part of the Naional Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). Nowadays economy, science and administration have an increasing demand for official three-dimensional spatial information (3 D-geodata) as a base for multiple applications. The surveying and mapping administration in Germany has accepted this demand as a challenge to develop and realize sustainable conceptions for 3 D-geodata, focusing on fast and economic solutions. In this context, national and international standards, infrastructures and activities had to be considered. The German AAA ® cadaster standard takes into account the international standardization of ISO and OGC to include 3 D-geodata. The cadaster in Germany is a parcel-based system, i. e. information is geographically referenced to unique, well-defined units of land. These units are defined by formal boundarie...|$|R
40|$|Recent data {{gathered}} by the World Bank show that informal markets are present all over the world, but particularly in (developing and developed) countries {{with high levels of}} inequality. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse whether this apparent empirical link between inequality and the size of the informal markets has any theoretical foundation. For this, the paper develops a model for the occupational choice of individuals in the presence of informal markets, which are de…ned as markets in which economic activities evade taxation and governmental regulation. The model shows the higher the initial level of inequality is the higher the size of the underground economy will be. With high levels of inequality, there are few people that are able to afford to set up business in the formal sector and instead they prefer to set up business at a small scale in the informal sector with lower costs and avoid <b>taxation.</b> For this <b>reason,</b> at early stages of development, informal and formal markets can coexist, but the model shows that in the long run the size of the informal economy can decline to a negligible size, depending on the initial distribution of wealth and the parameters of the economy (taxes and entr...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the question of how couples should be taxed. One reason for the importance of this issue is simply that the overwhelming majority of individuals live in households formed around couples, and so {{it could be argued that}} empirically, this is the single most important problem in personal income <b>taxation.</b> A second <b>reason</b> is that the economic theory of optimal taxation and tax reform, at least as it is presented in the mainstream literature, provides little guidance on this issue, resting as it does on models of the single person household. An old insight in the earlier public finance literature is that any discussion of the taxation of two-person households necessarily involves the recognition of the importance of household production. In this paper we try to show how a simple model of household production can be used to help the analysis of optimal taxation and tax reform, and to put the “conventional wisdom”, which says that it is optimal to tax women on a separate, lower tax schedule than men, on a firmer basis. What emerges clearly from the analysis is how centrally important the relationship between productivity in household production and female labour supply really is, and how little we know about it empirically. Optimal taxation, household production, labour supply. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Childhood {{obesity is}} a serious concern for {{developed}} and developing countries. This study aimed to assess the level of support in Australia for regulation and to assess whether systematic differences occur between individuals who support increased regulation and individuals who oppose it. Methods: An online survey (n = 563) {{was used to assess}} parental/caregiver preferences for taxation policy options and nutrition labelling designed to address the incidence of childhood obesity. Participants were parents or caregivers of young children (3 to 7 years) who were actively enrolled in an existing birth cohort study in South-East Queensland, Australia. Results: The majority of the parents (over 80 %) strongly agreed or agreed with labelling food and drink with traffic light or teaspoon labelling. Support for taxation was more variable with around one third strongly supporting and a further 40 % of participants equivocal about using taxation; however, a quarter strongly rejected this policy. Cluster analysis did not detect any socio-demographic differences between those who strongly supported taxation and those who did not. Conclusions: Better food labelling would be welcomed by parents to enhance food choices for their children. <b>Taxation</b> for health <b>reasons</b> would not be opposed by most parents. Implications for Public Health: Governments should consider taxation of unhealthy drinks and improved labelling to encourage healthy food purchasing.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show, contra the right-libertarian {{critique}} of social justice, that there are good reasons for defending policies of social justice within a free society. In the first part of the paper, we will present two influential right-libertarian critiques of social justice, found in Friedrich Hayek’s Law, Legislation and Liberty and Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State and Utopia. Based on their approach, policies of social justice are seen as an unjustified infringement on freedoms of individual members of a society. In response to this critique, we will introduce the distincion between formal and factual freedom and argue that the formal principle of freedom defended by Hayek and Nozick does not suffice for the protection of factual freedom of members of a society, because it does not recognize (1) the moral obligation to help those who, without their fault, lack factual freedom to a significant degree, and (2) the legal obligation of the state to protect civic dignity of all members of a society. In the second part of the paper, we offer an interpretation of Kant’s argument on taxation, according to which civic dignity presupposes factual freedom, in order to argue that Kant’s justification of <b>taxation</b> offers good <b>reasons</b> for claiming that the state has the legal obligation to protect factual freedom via the policies of social justice...|$|R
40|$|The non-law {{schools have}} long {{recognised}} {{the importance of}} the legal element in their programs and some of the most reputable commercial legal scholars are found in the law discipline within those schools. There is also an increasing number of non-law students in commercial law subjects within law schools. One of the main subjects attracting students from a variety of disciplines is <b>taxation.</b> For various <b>reasons,</b> but probably at least in part because of its association with traditional law school subjects for lawyers, mooting is seldom used in the teaching of taxation. This paper examines whether mooting can be used usefully in an undergraduate taxation law program that includes, or is made up of, non-law students. The first part of the paper reviews the skills that have been identified as being important to tax professionals, whether lawyers or non-lawyers. It looks at the development of those skills {{in the context of a}} mooting program and concludes that mooting is a valid method for developing many of the skills required of a tax professional, in whatever discipline the instruction takes place. The second part of the paper provides a detailed model of how a moot can be used as part of an undergraduate tax course in the light of the underlying theory. The paper concludes with a review of possible resource implications of implementing a mooting program and consideration of two particular problems that need to be dealt with...|$|R
5000|$|The {{explanation}} of the 1969 Act prepared by Congress's Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue <b>Taxation</b> described the <b>reason</b> for the AMT as follows:"The prior treatment imposed no limit {{on the amount of}} income which an individual or corporation could exclude from tax as the result of various tax preferences. As a result, there were large variations in the tax burdens placed on individuals or corporations with similar economic incomes, depending upon the size of their preference income. In general, those individual or corporate taxpayers who received the bulk of their income from personal services or manufacturing were taxed at relatively higher tax rates than others. On the other hand, individuals or corporations which received the bulk of their income from such sources as capital gains or were in a position to benefit from net lease arrangements, from accelerated depreciation on real estate, from percentage depletion, or from other tax-preferred activities tended to pay relatively low rates of tax. In fact, many individuals with high incomes who could benefit from these provisions paid lower effective rates of tax than many individuals with modest incomes. In extreme cases, individuals enjoyed large economic incomes without paying any tax at all. This was true for example in the case of 154 returns in 1966 with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 a year (apart from those with income exclusions which do not show on the returns filed). Similarly, a number of large corporations paid either no tax at all or taxes which represented very low effective rates." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of what policy options Sudan can choose to emerge from its current economic crisis of persistent inflation, unsustainable external and internal imbalances, and negative growth in real output is addressed in this study. An empirical general equilibrium model is constructed, validated and used to research the nature, causes and possible remedies for the economic problems of Sudan. The model {{is based on the}} multi-sector Walrasian equilibrium structure. Keynsian macro-features recognizing short-run adjustment dynamics, sticky prices and an endogenous monetary mechanism are also incorporated. The model allows for less than perfect flexibility in some markets such as the foreign exchange and domestic capital markets due to price rigidities. Partial adjustment in some agricultural sectors where supply lags exist are also modelled. The economy is disaggregated into 16 sectors. Detailed supply and demand specifications are given for each sector in the model. The general price level together with other nominal and real flows are endogenously determined in this model;Econometric methods are used to estimate the model parameters. This provided superior statistical basis for model predictions over calibration. A jacobian algorithm (GAMS/MINOS) is employed to solve the model for equilibrium in the product market. Validation and policy analysis are conducted using dynamic simulation. The model showed powerful performance in recovering the historical path of the economy;Policy experiments indicated that the economy is non-responsive to movements in nominal interest rates as the domestic credit market is highly controlled. Removal of the institutional rigidities in the domestic capital market is therefore necessary for effective monetary control and efficient allocation of capital resources in Sudan. Simulation results also provided further empirical support to the argument that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies have worked against stabilization and economic recovery in Sudan. The thesis objecting to removal of indirect <b>taxation</b> for budgetary <b>reasons</b> is challenged by the tax policy experiment results. The results of the six policy experiments suggested that for positive growth and improved performance of the Sudan economy, monetary control and minimal indirect taxation are required to support exchange rate adjustments...|$|R
60|$|For {{what reason}} ought {{equality}} {{to be the}} rule in matters of <b>taxation?</b> For the <b>reason</b> that {{it ought to be}} so in all affairs of government. A government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it. If any one bears less than his fair share of the burden, some other person must suffer more than his share. Equality of taxation, therefore, as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacrifice. It means apportioning the contribution of each person toward the expenses of government, so that he shall feel neither more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from his. There are persons, however, who regard the taxes paid by each member of the community as an equivalent for value received, in the shape of service to himself; and they prefer to rest the justice of making each contribute in proportion to his means upon the ground that he who has twice as much property to be protected receives, on an accurate calculation, twice as much protection, and ought, on the principles of bargain and sale, to pay twice as much for it. Since, however, the assumption that government exists solely for the protection of property is not one to be deliberately adhered to, some consistent adherents of the quid pro quo principle go on to observe that protection being required for persons as well as property, and everybody’s person receiving the same amount of protection, a poll-tax of a fixed sum per head is a proper equivalent for this part of the benefits of government, while the remaining part, protection to property, should be paid for in proportion to property. But, in the first place, it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government. In the second place, the practice of setting definite values on things essentially indefinite, and making them a ground of practical conclusions, is peculiarly fertile in the false views of social questions. It can not be admitted that to be protected in the ownership of ten times as much property is to be ten times as much protected. If we wanted to estimate the degrees of benefit which different persons derive from the protection of government, we should have to consider who would suffer most if that protection were withdrawn: to which question, if any answer could be made, it must be, that those would suffer most who were weakest in mind or body, either by nature or by position.|$|R
