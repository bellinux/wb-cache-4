5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} {{forests are}} arrays of roughly vertically aligned nanotubes. Under certain growth conditions, these forests can show a growth instability that {{gives rise to}} periodic ripples that are coherent over a forest-sized scale.

Here, we identify the conditions that reproducibly promote the formation of these <b>ripples.</b> We investigate <b>the</b> formation mechanism via ex situ scanning electron microscopy and in situ optical imaging. While <b>the</b> <b>rippling</b> amplitude varies appreciably, <b>the</b> <b>rippling</b> wavelength varies very little and can be estimated from simple mechanical considerations.
