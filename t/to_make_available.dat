5|$|Gameplay in Popotan {{follows a}} semi-predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but {{personal}} storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near {{the ruins of}} Tokyo in the distant future. The player's goal is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse {{with one of the}} girls. The player can pursue other girls once they have finished one of the sisters' storylines.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, {{a further}} {{improved}} version, the BN-2B Islander II, was produced {{as a result}} of a product improvement program. The BN-2B model involved several changes, including a redesigned cockpit and a reduction in cabin noise levels. In 1980, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> turboprop engines for the type, adopting twin Allison 250-B17C engines; when the latter are installed, the aircraft is designated the BN-2T Turbine Islander. The first such BN-2T entered service in 1981.|$|E

25|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that The Wolf Age would receive little to no technical support or official patches from either MumboJumbo or Take-Two, a group of programmers, artists and coders banded together under the name MythDevelopers, and approached Take-Two to ask for access to the game's source code so as to continue its development. To the surprise of many in the industry, Take-Two not only granted MythDevelopers access to The Wolf Ages code, they also authorized Bungie <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> the source code for the first two games.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, a New Jersey state appeals court, in the {{decision}} Lewis v. Harris, upheld a state law defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, in part, by accepting that the marriage procreation link although maybe not wise wasn't irrational. However, in 2006, the New Jersey state Supreme Court unanimously overruled that decision, requiring the state <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> to all couples in New Jersey the equal protection of family laws irrespective of {{the gender of the}} participants but not necessarily the title.|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

25|$|Designed by W. E. W. Petter, the Gnat has {{its origins}} in the {{preceding}} private venture Folland Midge. The issuing of Operational Requirement OR.303 by the British Air Ministry served to motivate the type's development, the Gnat was later submitted to meet this requirement. Its design allowed for its construction and maintenance tasks {{to be carried out}} without specialised tools, making it suitable for use in countries that had not yet become highly industrialised. The Gnat has been viewed as a major motivating factor towards the issuing of the NATO NBMR-1 requirement, which sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> a common strike/attack light fighter with which to equip the air forces of the various NATO members.|$|E
25|$|General Heinz Guderian had {{originally}} planned {{to execute a}} major offensive against the 1st Belorussian Front, cutting off the leading elements of Georgy Zhukov's forces east of the Oder. The Soviet forces were to be attacked from Stargard (Pomerania) in the north {{as well as from}} Glogau (Silesia) and Guben (Brandenburg) in the south. In order to carry out these plans, he requested that the Courland Pocket be evacuated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> the divisions trapped there, removed troops from Italy and Norway, and involved Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army which had been intended for counter-attacks in Hungary. In a meeting with Guderian Hitler insisted that Courland be held and that the army continue with its planned attacks in Hungary; the meeting rapidly degenerated into a heated and farcical argument.|$|E

Then, it was also repeated on TVN7.|$|E
25|$|The {{institutionalization of}} science {{occurred}} throughout the 18th century. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin established the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first library {{owned by a}} group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments. Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> to all free of charge, forming the first Public Library. Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published Memoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{have stated}} that one {{motivation}} to submit these reports may be to avoid identification by other states as having failed to implement ICCPR principles, or risk the embarrassment of being blacklisted. The publication of State Reports on the internet allows for individual access to a country's progress {{as well as the}} response from the HRC. Public accessibility to reports has been further aided with a United Nations General Assembly resolution (57/300) <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>available</b> in the UN information centre of each state, copies of recent state reports, summary records and concluding observations. This stigma that may result from non-compliance does not prevent some reports being excessively late, and in some cases, erroneous. The non-invasive nature of the process means the committee is precluded from enforce recommendations made during the reporting process, therefore the power lies with the state in deciding whether the observe these observations.|$|E
