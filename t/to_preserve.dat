5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California.

There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E
