Therefore, {{the type of}} horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry or pull, and distance <b>travelled.</b> <b>Weight</b> affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection, but added weight reduces maximum speed. Therefore, various cultures had different military needs. In some situations, one primary type of horse was favoured over all others. In other places, multiple types were needed; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance, and then switch to a heavier horse, with greater weight-carrying capacity, when wearing heavy armour in actual combat.|$|R

The design, known as Lubok, reached trials in 1932 and in 1934 was adopted as the 122-mm howitzer model 1934. It had a 23 caliber barrel, a maximum elevation of 50°, traverse of 7°, and a combat and <b>travelling</b> <b>weight</b> of 2,250 and 2,800kg respectively. Like its predecessors, Lubok had a fixed trail carriage and although it was equipped with suspension, its wheels lacked tires, limiting towing speed to only 10km/h. Nevertheless, it was undoubtfully superior to the M1910/30 which remained in production until 1941. However, after eight pieces were built in 1934-1935, production was stopped for unclear reasons, possibly relating to the disbanding of KB-2.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to address how obesity is {{affecting}} the proper use of child restraints. Child passenger safety advocates recommend that a child be secured in a 5 -point harness restraint until at least the age of four. Unfortunately, high obesity rates in toddlers are creating a problem because most standard restraints only allow a weight maximum of 40 pounds. Overweight children are being improperly secured during <b>travel.</b> <b>Weights</b> and BMI?s were analyzed from children two and three years old enrolled in WIC to determine how many children do not fit in a standard harness weight child restraint. The study found that 7. 5 % (49) children from the population sampled, weighed greater than 40 pounds; thus would not fit in a standard weight child restraint. In addition, 20 % of the sample fell into either the ?overweight? or ?obese? category based on their BMI. The information found can shed light on the need for parent and law enforcement education on high-weight harness restraints, affordable and accessible high weight harness restraints, and vehicle LATCH systems engineered to handle higher weight limits on restraints...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{contribution}} {{reports on}} a type of pneu-matic artificial muscles (PAMs) that was recently developed at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, department of Mechanical Engineering. Its distinguishing feature is its pleated design. Due to this, {{it has a very}} high contraction force and an equally high <b>travel.</b> The <b>weight</b> of these pleated PAMs is very low: a muscle of only 60 gr can pull up to 3500 N and contract by an amount of 42 %. Furthermore, dry friction and associated hysteresis, typical of many other designs, is avoided by the folding–unfolding action. This significantly simplifies position control using these actuators. Although the force–displacement characteristics of our actuators are non–linear, they can be effectively controlled using basic linear PI techniques. Another advantage of these actua-tors is their inherent and controllable compliance, making them ideally suited for walking/running machines or when-ever delicate tasks, e. g. handling fragile objects, have to be performed. In view of all characteristics pleated PAMs are very well suited for automation and robotic applications. I...|$|R

50|$|To make {{controllable}} {{automatic fire}} possible {{through such a}} system, designer Stechkin employs several mechanical solutions. Firstly, the slide has a very long stroke (three times {{the length of the}} cartridge). This allows time to slow the slide down and reduce felt recoil by minimising the jolt produced through the collision of the slide with the frame. Secondly, the rate-reducer lever offers extra resistance to the opening stroke of the slide, further slowing down the cycling process. Finally, the primary inertial rate reducing plunger delays the dropping of the hammer after the slide closes. The slide has a large cam that strikes a lever downwards. This lever transfers that energy to a spring-loaded weight located in the grip. The <b>weight</b> <b>travels</b> down, compressing its spring, then slams back up into the trigger bar, tripping the sear and firing the gun. Effectively, the rate reducer, which reduced the automatic rate of fire from 1000 RPM to 750RPM, also acts as the auto-sear.|$|R

50|$|The East India Company took {{constructive}} {{steps to}} improve the existing systems in India when, in 1688, they opened a post office in Bombay followed by similar ones in Calcutta and Madras. Lord Clive further expanded the services in 1766 and in 1774 Warren Hastings made the services available to the general public. The fee charged was two annas per 100 miles. The postmarks applied on these letters are very rare and are named 'Indian Bishop Marks' after Colonel Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom who introduced this practice in Britain. The Post Office Department of the East India Company was first established on 31 March 1774 at Calcutta, followed in 1778 at Madras and in 1792 at Bombay. After 1793, when Cornwallis introduced the Regulation of the Permanent Settlement, the financial responsibility for maintaining the official posts rested with the zamindars. Alongside these, private dawk mail systems sprang up for the commercial conveyance of messages using hired runners.

50|$|This type of cam {{was used}} for example in {{mechanical}} time keeping clocking-in clocks to drive the day advance mechanism at precisely midnight and consisted of a follower being raised over 24 hours by the cam in a spiral path which terminated at a sharp cut off at which the follower would drop down and activate the day advance. Where timing accuracy is required as in clocking-in clocks these were typically ingeniously arranged to have a roller cam follower to raise the drop weight {{for most of its}} journey to near its full height, and only for the last portion of its <b>travel</b> for the <b>weight</b> to be taken over and supported by a solid follower with a sharp edge. This ensured that the weight dropped at a precise moment, enabling accurate timing. This was achieved by the use of two snail cams mounted coaxially with the roller initially resting on one cam and the final solid follower on the other but not in contact with its cam profile. Thus the roller cam was initially carried the weight, until at the final portion of the run the profile of the non-roller cam rose more than the other causing the solid follower to take the weight.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the sake}} of comparison, Wehrmacht possessed several models of heavy 15 cm guns: K 16, K 18, K 39; {{a limited number of}} naval SK C/28 guns were fitted with wheeled carriages. However the combat {{efficacy}} of these [...] "wheeled naval guns" [...] has never been independently verified by corroborating with non-Wehrmacht sources. The most numerous of those was K 18, with at least 101 pieces built. Like with Br-2, its barrel and carriage were transported separately, though it had a shorter range. However, the Rheinmetall design was superior in many respects, none of which translated into verifiable battlefield performance for the German. It was lighter (18,310 kg in travel position, 12,930 kg in combat position), which was only necessary due to the Wehrmacht's reliance on outdated halftracks as tow vehicles. It used turntable platform to achieve relatively quick 360 degrees traverse, though this was negated by the Wehrmacht's awful fire direction procedure for corps and above. Another comparable weapon was the 17 cm K 18 MrsLaf (338 pieces). Similar to the Br-2 in <b>weight</b> (<b>travel</b> 23,375 kg, combat 17,520 kg), and also separately transported, this gun was far more powerful because the Germans overbored it and gave it a much shorter barrel life. It fired 68 kg shells to the range of 29.6 km once in rigged test conditions, but never was recorded with achieving this in combat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We are {{witnessing}} increasing {{interests in the}} effective use of road networks. For example, to enable effective vehicle routing, weighted-graph models of transportation networks are used, where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge, e. g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. <b>Weights</b> that capture <b>travel</b> times and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network with <b>travel</b> cost based <b>weights</b> from a set of trips in the network that cover {{only a small fraction}} of the edges, each with an associated ground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by minimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account the topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank values of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and the property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to assign weights. Empirical studies with <b>weights</b> capturing <b>travel</b> time and GHG emissions on two road networks (Skagen, Denmark, and North Jutland, Denmark) offer insight into the design properties of the proposed techniques and offer evidence that the techniques are effective...|$|R
