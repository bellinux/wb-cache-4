40|$|Biochar {{production}} and waste <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> represent an attractive solution to decrease carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations {{and to enhance}} the enrichment of soils by treating in a more sustainable way the biodegradable waste generated in urban or rural areas. However, its application in developed regions (such as Scotland) is still uncertain due to the consolidation of other disposal and treatment technologies in the waste market. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} analyze this technology and compare it, from an environmental and economical point of view, with other waste treatment and disposal technologies that are currently operating in Scotland, such as landfill disposal or anaerobic digestion...|$|E
40|$|Thermodesorption {{coupled to}} gas {{chromatography}} coupled to mass spectroscopy (TD-GC–MS) {{has been investigated}} to identify volatile degradation products generated during wood heat <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> mild <b>pyrolysis.</b> For this purpose, wood samples of different softwood and hardwood species have been heat treated under nitrogen for different temperatures comprised between 180 and 230 °C during 15 min in the glass thermal desorption tube of the thermodesorber and the volatile wood degradation products trapped. The trapped products were then thermodesorbed and analysed by GC–MS. Chromatograms of the different samples indicated the formation of different products resulting from degradation of lignin and hemicelluloses. Hardwoods were shown {{to be more sensitive}} to thermodegradation than softwoods, for which degradation products appear at slightly higher temperature. The important formation of acetic acid is concomitant with the formation of most of degradation products and at the origin of the difference of reactivity observed between softwoods and hardwoods.

40|$|International audienceLast decades, {{wood was}} {{promoted}} as building material. Wood heat <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> mild <b>pyrolysis</b> {{has been reported}} to improve biological durability and dimensional stability of the material and constitutes an attractive `` non biocidal `` alternative to classical preservation treatments. Previous studies have shown that conferred properties strongly depend on the heat treatment intensity. A quality control marker based on mass loss has been developed. For several years, the increased development of Tunisian wood industry provides a significant capacity of wood production and transformation. Forests in Tunisia consist essentially of coniferous species [Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), Radiata pine (Pinus radiata), Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), Stone pine (Pinus pinea) ], characterised by a weak natural durability. Improved durability and fungal resistance should allow the use of Tunisian species in the wood industry. Import limitation of European species and the use of local species allow the conservation of economic value added in the country and improve the economic balance. For this reason, several Tunisian softwood species (Aleppo pine, Radiata pine and Maritime pine) have been heat-treated under vacuum atmosphere at 230 degrees C to obtain a thermal degradation with mass losses of approximately 8, 10 and 12 %. The oven device allows recording the dynamic Mass Loss (ML) during the treatment and following the thermodegradation kinetic. The chemical composition of the studied wood samples was determined before and after heat treatment. For each wood species and treatment intensity, wood chemical and mechanical analyses were performed by measuring O/C ratio, bending and hardness tests. Afterward, tests of decay resistance were performed according to the EN 113 Standard, with different fungal attacks (Poria Placenta, Coriolus Versicolor) at 22 degrees C and 70 % of humidity for 16 weeks. Results were related to the mass loss. Furthermore, intensity of thermal degradation was evaluated by TD-GC-MS. Treated and untreated wood samples were maintained during 15 minutes at 230 degrees C under nitrogen in the thermodesorption tube in order to analyse and compare resulting from the wood thermodegradation volatile compounds...|$|R
