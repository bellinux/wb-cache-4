5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of grid electricity.

5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to <b>the</b> <b>price</b> board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a production economy where commodities are partitioned into K irreproducible factors and L reproducible goods, {{and the production}} technologies have constant returns to scale. We examine the geometry of the global production set {{in the space of}} commodities, and we derive theorems of non-substitution type. We define the "factors values" of the different goods, we use them to characterize the efficient production plans, and we investigate in detail the relations between <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of goods and <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of factors. We show that <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of factors uniquely determine <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of goods, and that, generically, equalising <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of 2 K goods equalises <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of factors.

In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram).

5000|$|Prices in a {{structured}} derivative market not only replicate the discernment {{of the market}} participants about the future but also lead <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of underlying to the professed future level.

50|$|Nontradables are {{primarily}} {{services and the}} output of the construction industry. Nontradables also lead to deviations in PPP because <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of nontradables are not linked internationally. <b>The</b> <b>prices</b> are determined by domestic supply and demand, and shifts in those curves lead to changes in the market basket of some goods relative to <b>the</b> foreign <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> same basket.

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>price</b> {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in <b>the</b> <b>price,</b> no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>price</b> {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on <b>the</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>price</b> {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when <b>the</b> <b>price</b> is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E
