40|$|The aim of {{this work}} in {{cooperation}} with Red Hat Czech company is to design, implement and verify documentation generator for test written using BeakerLib library, which effectively creates documentation from BeakerLib <b>tests</b> <b>without</b> <b>any</b> documentation markup. In the first step generator parses data from every BeakerLib command in the test. Subsequently data are transformed as a natural language information. At the end generator transforms this information into documentation template. In this case an argparse method was used to find possible data from BeakerLib commands. In contrast to existing documentation generators this generator brings {{a new way of}} documentary creation from <b>tests</b> <b>without</b> <b>any</b> documentation markup. Thanks to this point of view we can generate documentation, which is created on base of  automated understanding of test source code.

40|$|Problem statement: This study {{presents}} the results of ANFIS based model proposed for predicting the performance characteristics of reinforced HSC beams subjected to different levels of corrosion damage and strengthened with externally bonded glass fibre reinforced polymer laminates. Approach: A total of 21 beams specimens of size 150, 250 × 3000 mm were cast and tested. Results: Out of the 21 specimens, 7 specimens were <b>tested</b> <b>without</b> <b>any</b> corrosion damage (R-Series), 7 after inducing 10 % corrosion damage (ASeries) and another 7 after inducing 25 % corrosion damage (B-Series). Out of the seven specimens in each series, one was <b>tested</b> <b>without</b> <b>any</b> laminate, three specimens were tested after applying 3 mm thick CSM, UDC and WR laminates and another three specimens after applying 5 mm thick CSM, UDC and WR laminates. Conclusion/Recommendations: The test results show that the beams strengthened with externally bonded GFRP laminates exhibit increased strength, stiffness, ductility and composite action until failure. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model is developed for predicting the study parameters for input values lying within the range of this experimental study...|$|R
