5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually <b>true</b> <b>white</b> horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E
25|$|<b>True</b> <b>white</b> horses have unpigmented pink {{skin and}} unpigmented white hair, though eye color varies. The lack of pigment {{in the skin}} and hair {{is caused by the}} absence of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Some coat colors are {{characterized}} by light or white-like coats and even pinkish skin, however these white-like coats are not lacking melanocytes. Instead, white-like coat colors result from various changes in the ways melanocytes produce pigment.|$|E

2500|$|The off-white coat, {{pale blue}} eyes, and rosy pink skin {{distinguish}} the coats of double-dilutes {{from those of}} <b>true</b> <b>white</b> horses. <b>True</b> <b>white</b> horses have unpigmented skin and hair due to the incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest during development.|$|E
2500|$|<b>True</b> <b>white</b> hair {{is rooted}} in unpigmented skin that lacks melanocytes. In contrast, diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary due to the {{concentration}} or chemical structure of the pigments made by these pigment-producing cells, not {{the absence of the}} cells themselves. [...] There are at least five known types of pigment dilution in horses, three which, as described below, can act to produce off-white phenotypes. Horses with strongly diluted coat colors usually have pale blue eyes, cream-colored coats, and rosy-pink skin. White markings are usually visible upon closer inspection.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{video and}} digital still cameras can adjust for color {{temperature}} by zooming {{into a white}} or neutral colored object and setting the manual [...] "white balance" [...] (telling the camera that [...] "this object is white"); the camera then shows <b>true</b> <b>white</b> as white and adjusts all the other colors accordingly. White-balancing is necessary especially when indoors under fluorescent lighting and when moving the camera from one lighting situation to another. Most cameras also have an automatic white balance function that attempts to determine {{the color of the}} light and correct accordingly. While these settings were once unreliable, they are much improved in today's digital cameras and produce an accurate white balance {{in a wide variety of}} lighting situations.|$|E
2500|$|Gray horses {{have the}} most common [...] "white-like" [...] coat color. However, the most {{noticeable}} difference between a gray horse whose hair coat is completely white and a white horse is skin color: most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes, white horses have light, unpigmented skin. [...] The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, {{as opposed to the}} unpigmented pink skin of <b>true</b> <b>white</b> horses. [...] The skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as white markings, certain white spotting patterns or dilution genes. [...] Gray foals may be born any color, but the colored hairs of their coat become progressively silvered as they age, eventually giving mature gray horses a white or nearly-white hair coat. [...] Gray is controlled by a single dominant allele of a gene that regulates specific kinds of stem cells. [...] Gray horses are at an increased risk for melanoma; 70-80% of gray horses over the age of 15 have a melanoma tumor.|$|E

The Marquis de Nidemerle had sent a young officer and sergeant's party to meet the travellers several miles off, and bring them unquestioned through the outposts of the frontier town, so closely watched {{in this time of}} war, and at about half a mile from the gates he himself, with a few attendants, rode out all glittering and clanking in their splendid uniforms and accoutrements. He doffed his hat with the heavy white plume, and bowed his greeting to the ladies and clergymen, but both the young Frenchmen, after a military salute, hastily dismounted and knelt on one knee, while he sprang from his horse, and then, making the sign of the Cross over his son, raised him, and folding him in his arms pressed him to his breast and kissed him on each cheek, not without tears, then repeated the same greeting with young D'Aubepine. He then kissed the hand of his belle cousine, whom, of course, he knew already, and bowed almost to the ground on being presented to Mademoiselle Woodford, a little less low to Monsieur Archfield, who was glad the embracing was not to be repeated, politely received Mr. Fellowes, and honoured the domestic abbe with a kindly word and nod.
