5|$|During {{the early}} 1720s, a {{constitutional}} struggle began between the Provost and <b>the</b> <b>Fellows,</b> {{culminating in a}} lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, Edmund Gibson, then Bishop of Lincoln. The Provost continued to reject candidates, fuelling discontent among <b>the</b> <b>Fellows,</b> until a writ of attachment against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the original statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second versiont, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for <b>the</b> <b>Fellows,</b> supporting the original charter of Edward II.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Vermont {{to work as a}} {{mechanical}} engineer for <b>the</b> <b>Fellows</b> Gear Shaper Company. He was already friendly with James Hartness, the president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J), another company in town. In 1911, Flanders married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic lathe. Flanders redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of 245 fellow eyes of patients admitted in primary acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) is presented. Twenty-five (10. 2 %) had acute ACG in <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> eye on presentation. Of the remaining 220, 33 (15 %) subsequently developed acute ACG before prophylactic surgery was performed. Possible predisposing factors were analysed. The main findings were that acute ACG in <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> eye occurred most frequently in hospital, {{or during the}} first month after discharge if prophylactic surgery was not performed. The instillation of mydriatics in the operated eye increased the risk to <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> eye. Pilocarpine and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors confer the best protection on <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> eye, but no medical regimen entirely prevented an attack of acute ACG in <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> eye...|$|R

5|$|On 24 January 1674, Bishop Fuller {{issued a}} decree {{dealing with the}} {{recommendations}} of the commissioners—a majority of all <b>the</b> <b>Fellows</b> should always be present at an election, so the Provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty's election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in retirement, he {{received}} an unexpected invitation to become Master of Peterhouse in 1987, thus becoming {{the first person in}} over four centuries to lead a college at both Oxford and Cambridge. Chadwick's second appointment as head of a college proved a happier experience than his first. The college had been experiencing some problems following the admission of the first female students, to which some fellows were implacably opposed, making their displeasure known at High Table. Chadwick insisted on civility, which coupled with the retirement of some of <b>the</b> <b>fellows,</b> ensured an improvement in the atmosphere within the college. This continued after his second retirement (again to Oxford) in 1993. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1991 he published a new translation of Augustine's Confessions, with extensive notes revealing Augustine's debt to Plotinus.|$|E
5000|$|Social {{entrepreneurs}} who pass {{the selection process}} are called Ashoka fellows. [...] Each Ashoka fellow receives a financial stipend that <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> can use {{to pay for their}} personal expenses so <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> can fully devote <b>the</b> <b>fellow's</b> time in pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>fellow's</b> innovative social ideas. The size of the stipend is decided on a case by case basis, according to the cost of living in the entrepreneur's local area. The stipend is available for up to three years. The organization is very clear that the stipend is only for living expenses and not for funding the social entrepreneur's initiative or organization.|$|R

5|$|In the inter-war years (1918–39) Jesus {{was seen}} {{by some as a}} small college and {{something}} of a backwater; it attracted relatively few pupils from the public schools traditionally seen as the most prestigious. The college did, however, attract many academically able entrants from the grammar schools (particularly those in northern England and Scotland). Among these grammar-school boys was Harold Wilson, who would later become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. During the Second World War, many of <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> served in the armed forces or carried out war work in Oxford. The college remained full of students, though, as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned, and also housed officers on military courses.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{had planned}} {{for a college}} of a Principal and sixty {{bachelor}} fellows; however, Sutton lowered this to only twelve. The Principal was required to be over thirty, a graduate and priest, and {{have the support of}} the Visitor, the Bishop of Lincoln. He was entitled to take up ecclesiastic office or duties that did not interfere overly with his job as principal; <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> were required to be resident for ten months of each year. Entrants to the college would have been only 11 or 12 years old, with an intake both from those whose income was very low, alongside those from gentlemanly backgrounds. Fellows had a high degree of autonomy, but received only board and lodging as reward.|$|E
5|$|T. E. Lawrence, perhaps {{better known}} as Lawrence of Arabia, was {{stationed}} at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a revised version of his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm too shy to go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with <b>the</b> <b>fellows.</b> They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E
40|$|The VA {{inpatient}} rotation provides <b>the</b> senior cardiology <b>fellow</b> {{with a broad}} {{exposure to}} the care of the hospitalized cardiology and cardiac surgery patient. <b>The</b> <b>fellow</b> will have substantial responsibility for the evaluation and treatment of inpatients requiring invasive cardiac procedures. As such, <b>the</b> inpatient <b>fellow</b> will work closely with <b>the</b> consult <b>fellow</b> and <b>the</b> junior invasive <b>fellow</b> in triaging patients requiring coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, and electrophysiologic testing, and device implantation. Whenever possible, <b>the</b> inpatient <b>fellow</b> will directly participate in invasive therapeutic procedures such as percutaneous coronary interventions and EP device implantation. Following <b>the</b> procedures, <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> becomes responsible for the post-procedure care of patients not on the housestaff service. During the rotation, <b>the</b> inpatient <b>fellow</b> is also expected to round on a bi-weekly basis with the Cardiac Surgery Service on post-surgical patients in the Medical/Surgical ICU and Intermediate ICU. <b>The</b> <b>fellow</b> is also strongly encouraged to observe at least one cardiac surgery case in order to better understand cardiac anatomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac anesthesia, and use of intra-operative TEE. At the start of the rotation, <b>the</b> inpatient <b>fellow</b> will contact <b>the</b> Chief Cardia...|$|R

He said <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> didn't give any name, but said he was looking up some ranch properties for some Chicago capitalists." ...|$|R

5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from <b>the</b> <b>Fellows</b> at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
5|$|A further {{delay in}} {{construction}} {{was announced in}} 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.|$|E
5|$|Charles Buller Heberden became {{principal}} in 1889. He saw sporting {{as a means}} to the institution of civility than an end in itself; together with Richard Lodge, it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal. Academic rigour was reintroduced to the college, and the staff of Brasenose were increasingly successful in maintaining discipline. Until the end of the century, however, the number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts. Author John Buchan joined in 1895, a man of this new era– although his work continued to portray Brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype. Heberden was also the first lay principal, although he was personally committed to the church– purchasing an organ for the chapel out of his own personal funds. Brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all. Three of the ten fellows were set aside for non-classicists; a Junior Common Room (JCR) was created in 1887; in 1897 the library was opened up to undergraduates; in 1899, Fellows were granted a right to sabbatical leave. <b>The</b> <b>fellows</b> themselves were increasingly secular; only four of fourteen fellows were clergy.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, three visitations {{reformed}} the University of Oxford in the Parliamentarians' preferred style, including purging Brasenose of its remaining loyalists. Sir William Petty, {{a former}} student, {{was among those}} promoted to fellow of the college. Samuel Radcliffe, Principal, was to be replaced with Dr Daniel Greenwood, a long-term fellow {{of the college of}} Puritan sympathies by order of the visitors. However, the college held out repeatedly against efforts to expel or remove its fellows and principal, most through deliberate inactivity. Radcliffe was ill and continued to personally oppose handing over control of the college to Greenwood, particularly the college archives and treasury. <b>The</b> <b>fellows,</b> also opposing Greenwood, instead elected Thomas Yate to replace Radcliffe upon his death, although owing to the visitors' choice of Greenwood he would not take up his post fully for twelve years. Over this period, thirteen of Brasenose's sixteen remaining fellows were expelled, but the college survived.|$|E
25|$|In April 1687, James ordered <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> of Magdalen College, Oxford {{to elect}} a Catholic, Anthony Farmer, as their president. <b>The</b> <b>fellows</b> {{believed}} Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected John Hough instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so could not wait for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> to elect the Bishop of Oxford. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. <b>The</b> <b>fellows</b> then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford as their president but James required that they admit {{they had been in}} the wrong and ask for his pardon. When they refused most of <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> were ejected and replaced by Catholics.|$|E
