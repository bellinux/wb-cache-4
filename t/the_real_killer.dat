5|$|A {{few months}} later, Phoenix's {{reputation}} takes a hit when {{he fails to}} properly defend a former client, Maggey Byrde, against accusations that she poisoned a talented programmer, Glen Elg. Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him say something only <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer</b> would know.|$|E
5|$|However, Seymour later recanted her story, {{and another}} man came forth {{claiming}} to know the identity of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer.</b> This new evidence, along with the behaviour of the judge in both the initial case and the appeal, made the case controversial enough that Members of Parliament from the three major political parties directly questioned the Home Secretary on the matter. Despite many requests for clemency, all appeals were denied, and Williams was executed in 1913. The case {{was one of the}} first investigations in Britain to use the emerging science of ballistics.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several {{instances}} when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has {{shed some light on}} the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of Mississippi vs. Bourne, the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendantâ€™s teeth. DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene. In the case of State vs. Krone, the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer</b> and Krone was set free.|$|E

25|$|Jeffreys's DNA {{method was}} first {{put to use}} in 1985 {{when he was asked}} to help in a disputed {{immigration}} case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from Ghana. The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to {{the other members of the}} family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results. DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls. This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer</b> was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. In 1992, Jeffreys' methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele, who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a femur bone of his exhumed skeleton, with DNA from his widow and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts, attempts to identify <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer</b> are hampered {{by the lack of}} surviving forensic evidence. DNA analysis on extant letters is inconclusive; the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results. There have been mutually incompatible claims that DNA evidence points conclusively to two [...] suspects, and the methodology of both has also been criticised.|$|E
500|$|The film is {{loosely based}} on the actual crimes {{attributed}} to an unidentified serial killer known as the Phantom Killer; it claims that [...] "the incredible story {{you are about to}} see is true, where it happened and how it happened; only the names have been changed." [...] The actual Phantom attacked eight people between February 22 and May 3, 1946 in or near the town of Texarkana, Texas, which is on the Texas border with Arkansas. Most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside Texarkana, in Bowie County, Texas, while the film has them occurring in Arkansas. However, the general outline of the murders largely follows reality, with mostly minor artistic license taken. As in the film, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>killer</b> was never identified nor apprehended.|$|E
