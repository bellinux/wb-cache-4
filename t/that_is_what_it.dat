25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is to be human.|$|E

In 1909, Kanō {{incorporated}} the Kodokan, and endowed it with ¥10,000 (then about U.S. $4,700). The reason, said Japan Times on 30 March 1913, was [...] "so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct, for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> really does, the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth, without its founder's personal attention." ...|$|E

500|$|Oxford's {{finishing}} {{coach was}} surprised that Cambridge made such a good start, while his counterpart, Stephen Peel, had hoped that his crew would [...] "rattle Oxford by breaking contact". Winning head coach Stephen Royle praised his stroke, Obholzer: [...] "Rupert was brilliant. [...] He took the race by the scruff of the neck." [...] Despite Michels shouting [...] "see you at the finish" [...] as his boat pulled away from Cambridge, and a celebration considered [...] "street-gang-style prancing" [...] by the Oxford crew, Michels explained: [...] "without Cambridge, there is no race. [...] The beauty of the event is the personal conflict, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> brings out in the crowds." ...|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Truman's {{decision}} argue that, {{given the}} tenacious Japanese {{defense of the}} outlying islands, the bombings saved {{hundreds of thousands of}} lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan. Critics have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary, given that conventional tactics such as firebombing and a naval blockade might have induced Japan's surrender without the need for such weapons. Truman strongly defended himself in his memoirs in 1955–56, stating that many lives could have been lost had the U.S. invaded mainland Japan without the atomic bombs. In 1963, he stood by his decision, telling a journalist that [...] "it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Indus script (also {{known as}} the Harappan script) is a corpus of symbols {{produced}} by the Indus Valley Civilization during the Kot Diji and Mature Harappan periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, {{making it difficult to}} judge whether or not [...] these symbols constituted a script used to record a language, or even symbolise a writing system. [...] In spite of many attempts, 'the script' has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known bilingual inscription to help decipher the script, nor does the script show any significant changes over time. [...] However, some of the syntax (if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> may be termed) varies depending upon location.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{all periods}} of Macedonski's work reflect, {{in whole or}} in part, his public persona and the polemics he was {{involved}} in. George Călinescu's emits a verdict on the relation between his lifetime notoriety and the public's actual awareness of his work: [...] "Macedonski [...] a poet well-known for being an unknown poet." [...] According to literary critic Matei Călinescu, the innovative aspects of his impact on Romanian literature were not as much related to his [...] "literary ideology", as much as to his [...] "contradictory spirit" [...] and [...] "essential nonconformism". However, literary researcher Adrian Marino proposes that Macedonski {{was one of the first}} modern authors to illustrate the importance of [...] "dialectic unity" [...] through his views on art, in particular by having argued that poetry needed to be driven by [...] "an idea". Having theorized once, while questioning Junimist rigor, that [...] "the logic of poetry is absurdity itself [...] ", the poet also said: [...] "Poetry is the chaos of spirit and matter, of the cries of distress and mad laughter. From the sublime to the trivial, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should be." [...] He later revised part of this verdict, and, making explicit his adoption of aestheticism, spoke against trivial subjects and in favor of the sublime.|$|E
2500|$|President Harry S. Truman had a {{well-known}} dislike of the Marines {{dating back to}} his service in World War I, and would say in anger in August 1950, [...] "The Marine Corps is the Navy's police force {{and as long as}} I am President, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will remain. They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's." [...] Johnson exploited this to reduce or eliminate many Marine Corps' budget requests. Johnson attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation entirely by transferring its air assets to the Navy and Air Force, and again proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces. Johnson ordered that the commandant be barred from attending Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings in his role of chief of service (including meetings involving Marine readiness or deployments), deleted him from the official roll of chiefs of service branches authorized a driver and limousine, and for whom a special gun salute was prescribed on ceremonial occasions. He further specified {{that there would be no}} future official recognition or celebration of the Marine Corps birthday. The Navy's surface fleet and amphibious ships were drastically reduced, and most landing craft were reserved for army use.|$|E

2500|$|Both Truman and Johnson {{extended}} {{their opposition to}} the Navy in their treatment of the U.S. Marine Corps.

[...] Johnson attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation by transferring its air assets to other services, and proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces. [...] Johnson ordered that the highest-ranking Marine officer, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, be deleted from the official roll of chiefs of service branches authorized a driver and limousine, and for whom a special gun salute was prescribed on ceremonial occasions. [...] He further specified {{that there would be no}} future official recognition or celebration of the Marine Corps birthday. [...] More ominously, Johnson barred the Commandant of the Marine Corps from attending Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) meetings in his role of chief of service (including meetings involving Marine readiness or deployments).|$|E

5000|$|Nick Totton commented about The Mind has Mountains in The Spectator: [...] "Mary Hocking writes brilliantly on {{many levels}} at once, because she knows that the {{everyday}} contains another, stranger reality: it only takes attention, an at first casual intensification of vision, to open the crack between the worlds ... The Mind Has Mountains is a funny, serious book, to be read and reread: the kind of book that bides its time, perhaps remaining an innocuous entertainment for years until a reader is opened to it by explosive experience—'so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant!' <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a Steppenwolf for our time; and, I think, the equal of Hesse's." ...|$|R
