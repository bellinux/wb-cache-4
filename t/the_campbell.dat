5|$|One of {{the long-standing}} controversies about Citizen Kane {{has been the}} authorship of the screenplay. Welles {{conceived}} the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, <b>The</b> <b>Campbell</b> Playhouse. Mankiewicz based the original outline {{on the life of}} William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary Flames {{have won}} the Western (previously <b>the</b> <b>Campbell)</b> Conference three times in {{franchise}} history, winning the Stanley Cup once, in 1989. They have twice won the Presidents' Trophy as the top team in the NHL during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{hosted the}} 1985 All-Star Game at the Olympic Saddledome. A {{sell-out}} crowd saw the Wales Conference defeat <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference 6–4, while Al MacInnis and Paul Reinhart represented the Flames at the game. Along with Theoren Fleury and Jarome Iginla, MacInnis played a franchise high six All-Star Games {{as a member}} of the Flames.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Campbell's</b> of Possil's first {{origins in}} Scotland {{is in the}} area of Argyll (...) , archaically Argyle (Earra-Ghàidheal in modern Gaelic [...] ), which is a region of western Scotland. The family is an {{extended}} branch of <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Kinloch and also <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Murthlie. These both have origins from <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Lawers.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, {{the next}} chief of <b>the</b> <b>Campbells,</b> <b>the</b> {{son of the}} former chief, was a Royalist, so after the {{restoration}} of Royalist rule, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> were not ultimately dispossessed of their gains. However, after James VII came to the Scottish throne, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> revolted, and <b>the</b> chief was executed, but his son, the new chief, {{took part in the}} successful explusion of James VII, so <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> once again ultimately retained their lands.|$|R
50|$|Principal Campbell himself {{belonged to}} <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Quoycrook in Caithness. They were {{claimed to have}} descended from MacIvers of Lergachonzie. Campbell also claimed that the related {{families}} to this branch were <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Duchernan, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Thurso and Lochend, and the Iverachs of Wideford in Orkney. Campbell of Airds notes that both {{the arms of the}} Iverachs and <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Duchernan display the gyronny prevalent in Campbell heraldry.|$|R
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or near the top of <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) {{in order to make it}} to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Campbell nominees and winners, such as Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} superstition that is {{prevalent among}} many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. There have been other teams, however, that have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophy and then {{went on to win the}} Cup anyway.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the civil}} war between Royalists and Puritans, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> had sided with the Puritans, so {{following}} their defeat at the Battle of Inverlochy, Clan Lamont {{took the opportunity to}} push back <b>the</b> borders of <b>Campbell</b> control. Predictably, in 1646, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> took revenge, and overran Toward Castle; after being offered hospitablity, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> slaughtered <b>the</b> Lamont occupants in their beds. Despite the chief of the Lamonts surrendering, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> hanged many members of Clan Lamont, in {{what became known as the}} Dunoon massacre.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Campbells</b> gave {{support to}} the Crown {{throughout}} the 15th century. By {{the end of the}} 15th century the power of the Lords of the Isles (chiefs of Clan Donald) who were the Crown's most powerful rivals had been broken leaving <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> as <b>the</b> main power in the area. From this time onwards <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> acted as <b>the</b> main instrument of central authority in the area and this could be the real cause of the ancient enmity between <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> and <b>the</b> MacDonalds.|$|R
50|$|The leading {{family of}} <b>the</b> MacIver <b>Campbells</b> were <b>the</b> MacIvers of Lergachonzie and Stronshira. A {{branch of the}} MacIvers were Captains of the Castle of Inveraray, where the {{standing}} stone in {{the grounds of the}} castle was said to have been the boundary between the lands of the MacIvers and the MacVicars. Other branches of MacIver <b>Campbells</b> include <b>the</b> MacIver <b>Campbells</b> of Ballochyle in Cowal, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Kirnan in Glassary, <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Pennymore on Loch Fyne, south of Inveraray, and <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> of Ardlarach near Ardfern, Craignish.|$|R
5|$|After {{defeating}} Dallas in five games, the Canucks {{eliminated the}} Toronto Maple Leafs in <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference Finals {{to meet the}} New York Rangers in the Finals, where the Canucks lost in seven games. Bure finished with a team-high 16 goals and 31 points in 24 games, second in playoff scoring only to Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brian Leetch. His points total also remained the highest by any Russian player until Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins recorded 36 in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Allied to John de Courcy, Donnchadh fought {{battles in}} Ireland and {{acquired}} land {{there that he}} subsequently lost. A patron of religious houses, particularly Melrose Abbey and North Berwick priory nunnery, he attempted to establish a monastery in his own territory, at Crossraguel. He married the daughter of Alan fitz Walter, a leading {{member of the family}} later known as the House of Stewart—future monarchs of Scotland and England. Donnchadh was the first mormaer or earl of Carrick, a region he ruled for more than six decades, making him one of the longest serving magnates in medieval Scotland. His descendants include the Bruce and Stewart Kings of Scotland, and probably <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Dukes of Argyll.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} one of its founders, Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal, from 1871 until his {{retirement}} in 1912. He was knighted as a Knight Bachelor by King Edward VII in 1909, for his services to blind people. He was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell, and following his death in 1929 Guy's widow, Louie Bealby Campbell took over the position. The role of principal passed outside <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> family for the first time upon Louie Bealby Campbell's retirement in 1934.|$|E
50|$|While {{the appeal}} was pending, in late 1984 <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> reached a verdict with Slusher and Ospital's estate, whereby those parties {{agreed not to}} seek {{satisfaction}} of the judgment against <b>the</b> <b>Campbells,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> would pursue a bad-faith action against State Farm. The attorneys for Slusher and Ospital's estate would represent <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> in <b>the</b> bad-faith suit and would make all major decisions regarding it. No settlement would take effect without the approval of Slusher and Ospital's estate, who would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.|$|R

50|$|Colin Campbell {{refused to}} {{recognize}} the claim of Gregor Roy MacGregor to the estates, and for ten years Gregor waged a war against <b>the</b> <b>Campbells.</b> He was an outlaw who raided cattle and sheltered in the high glens. However, in 1570, he was captured and killed by <b>the</b> <b>Campbells.</b> <b>The</b> chiefship was claimed by his son, Alistair, but {{he was unable to}} stem <b>the</b> <b>Campbell's</b> persecution of his kinsmen, who over time became known as the Children of the Mist, a name associated with the MacGregors due to the extent of their losses.|$|R
5|$|Fleury {{fell back}} to 33goals in 1991–92 as the Flames missed the playoffs. That season, {{he made his}} second All-Star Game appearance, {{recording}} a goal for <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference. Fleury finished with over 100points {{for the second time}} in his career in 1992–93 to lead the team in scoring, and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the panel in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the panel in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Campbell</b> Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E
50|$|Scott married Sarah Whitsette in 1823, and {{the family}} moved to Ohio in 1826 He began working with <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> in August of that year. He was hired to work as an evangelist in 1827. Within three years he brought over 3,000 {{converts}} into the movement. At that time <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> were associated with the Mahoning Baptist Association; as the number of converts grew, conflicts with other Baptists also grew. In 1839 Scott and <b>the</b> <b>Campbells</b> disassociated themselves from the Baptists.|$|R
