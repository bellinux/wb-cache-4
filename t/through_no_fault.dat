By then, however, <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> of the moneyers' {{there was a}} problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E

In Denmark, primary care is organized around a gatekeeping system, in which General Practitioners serve as gatekeepers to other medical services, including hospitals and specialists.

Additionally, the 1572 Vagabonds Act further enabled Justices of the Peace to survey and register the impotent poor, determine how much money was required for their relief, then assess parish residents weekly for the appropriate amount.

40|$|Many of the {{elements}} that have traditionally supported state level normative self-organization, most notably territory, are being actively undermined by rising sea levels, flooding, desertification, amongst other climate change effects. As more and more states come to be redefined as “disappearing”, that is, states losing their territories to the natural environment <b>through</b> <b>no</b> specific <b>fault</b> of their own, a question arises as to how displaced communities will be assisted in their desire (and right) to continue to practice principles of self-determination and self-government?

Instead, alternative ontological models of sovereign community are required, as is a re-imagining of how statehood might be re-constituted in the future in response to deepening ecological problems. The international community must now begin to address the immanent nature of threats posed to disappearing states and consider how a model of statehood that does not privilege territory as a fixed component of state identity could be operationalized. This paper considers how a democratic reform of statehood might proceed and resettlement agreements for displaced communities determined. The transition to an era of peaceful sovereign relations under deteriorating global climate conditions and growing natural resource scarcity, it argues, will require a significant extension of established traditions of democratic compromise, human rights solidarity and cosmopolitan justice...|$|R

500|$|In Argentine society, Messi is {{generally}} held in lesser esteem than Maradona, {{a consequence of}} not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi {{is in some ways}} the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.

[...] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months.

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Discrimination against {{persons with}} disabilities the world over {{in the realm of}} {{employment}} has been a real problem especially in developing countries such as Ghana, where there are no enough government incentives to help cushion the bad effects of unemployment and redundancy on the disabled. Negative perceptions suggesting that disability means incapability are rife and thus prevents the disabled from getting a job or rendering those who have jobs and became disabled <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>faults</b> of theirs' redundant. The disabled in Ghana, thus, can only make ends meet by resorting to begging on the streets, or engaging in some vocations. The few of them who are in employment face problems such as infrastructural deficiencies like the absence of adaptive aides to help them move around easily, for instance, the absence of elevators in storey buildings. Those in some vocations on their own suffer financial problems and hence cannot expand their ventures to the levels that can help them cater for their needs. Most of them are very poor and dependent on family and friends for survival. Laws made to safeguard their rights are not enforced. Ghana is not only a party to the ratification of the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, they have a Persons with Disability Act (Act 715 of 2006), but the situation is no better. This research aimed at exploring the difficulties faced by the disabled people in Ghana in terms of getting a job. Interview was set and qualitative method of study is applied to elicit authentic information from the informants who are graduates, vocational trained and illiterates, but are jobless. The study took place in Accra the capital of Ghana. Among other questions, the research found out how the disabled feels without a job {{and whether or not they}} would like to be employed. Twelve disabled (9 males and 3 females) were interviewed for this study. Informants chosen were the blind and physically challenged. All informants, but one wanted to work but they revealed "barriers" that prevents them from achieving that aim. Among some of the barriers were non-enforcement of existing laws that safeguard rights of the disabled; stereotyping and discrimination against {{persons with disabilities}}; and lack of capital to start businesses. Stemming the tides, it is expected of the government and various stakeholders to sensitize the population on the rights and capabilities of the disabled so as to reduce or eliminate the discrimination against them, as well as provide financial support and credit to those who wanted to start their own businesses.

If such barriers are removed they are going to enjoy a better life...|$|R
