500|$|During the 2008 presidential campaign, Swift {{promoted}} the Every Woman Counts campaign, aimed at engaging {{women in the}} political process, {{and was one of}} many country stars to record a PSA for the Vote (For Your) Country campaign. She stated: [...] "I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote." [...] Following Barack Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: [...] "I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive. I'm so glad <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> election." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan's {{individual}} {{event was}} the 400-metre freestyle. She reduced her personal best by 2.3 seconds in recording {{a time of}} 5 minutes 7.8 seconds in the heats, just 0.2 of a second behind Marley Shriver of the United States, who set a new Olympic record. The mark was surpassed in later heats by Fraser and Crapp, but Morgan nevertheless qualified fourth fastest for the final, almost seven seconds faster than the cutoff. The final was held {{the day after the}} relay final. Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance, finishing sixth in a time of 5 minutes 14.3 seconds, far outside her personal best. Had she repeated her heat swim, she would have placed fourth, just 0.7 of a second from the bronze medal. Nevertheless, she noted that [...] "I was so happy that I had made the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> appearance in a senior competition".|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

2500|$|As artist Peter Malick {{states in}} the liner notes, [...] "I started looking for a singer who could record [...] for me. [...] On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer {{announced}} the last song of the set. [...] The Dinah Washington classic [...] "Since I fell for You" [...] filled the room and I was struck breathless. [...] Here, {{in the tradition of}} Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> contact with Norah Jones." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was there}} that I first met Gurdjieff {{in the autumn of}} 1920, and no {{surroundings}} could have been more appropriate. In Gurdjieff, East and West do not just meet. Their difference is annihilated in a world outlook which knows no distinctions of race or creed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first,</b> and has remained one of my strongest impressions. A Greek from the Caucasus, he spoke Turkish with an accent of unexpected purity, the accent that one associates with those born and bred in the narrow circle of the Imperial Court. His appearance was striking enough even in Turkey, where one saw many unusual types. His head was shaven, immense black moustache, eyes which at one moment seemed very pale and at another almost black. Below average height, he gave nevertheless an impression of great physical strength ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the post-war}} period progressed, Abe's stance as an {{intellectual}} pacifist led to him joining the Japanese Communist Party, with whom he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after his reception of the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel {{the constraints of the}} Communist Party's rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created under the title of [...] "socialist realism." [...] By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish rebels and their freedom movement, drawing the ire of the Japanese Communist Party. The Party's criticism reaffirmed his stance: [...] "The Communist Party put pressure on me to change the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. I said I would never change my opinion on the matter. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> break with the Party." [...] The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the Twentieth Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. Here, Abe saw little of interest, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka's house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.|$|E

6000|$|Mark {{the nature}} of the human soul! I had begun with awe, not to say terror, for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{experience}} of such things. I stepped back from the banks of the Riverside Geyser, saying:--"Pooh! Is that all it can do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{inkling of}} what I was to {{understand}} more fully in later years.

6000|$|... "`Now I'll {{make the}} eyes,'" [...] said the farmer. So he painted my right eye, {{and as soon}} as it was {{finished}} I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of the world.|$|E

6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{lesson in}} the {{discipline}} of the sea, and I never forgot it.

It is enough that they command it, so that the motto is, [...] "Obey orders, though you break owners." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the words}} of the proverb, I was {{resolved}} not to let the grass grow under my feet. The next morning I set forth to seek an interview with Mrs. Clements. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> step forward in the investigation.

6000|$|... "Bless me, I don't know," [...] came back. [...] "At least <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> indiscretion. There <b>are</b> {{twenty-four hours}} in each day, and I must spend them somehow. Come {{and have a}} drink." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We're glad you've come," [...] replied Hutter, simply. [...] "I {{just got}} back from the East myself. Chicago an' Kansas City. I came to Arizona from Illinois over thirty years ago.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{close contact}} with death, and it filled me with awe.

Her dust mingled with the soil of the little burial ground just beyond the village bounds.|$|E
6000|$|It is useless, of course, {{to dwell}} upon my joy--upon my transport--upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. I loved. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> love--so I felt it to be. It was love supreme-indescribable. It was [...] "love at first sight;" [...] {{and at first}} sight, too, it had been {{appreciated}} and returned.|$|E

6000|$|The {{discourse}} with Andries Coejemans {{was interrupted}} by the sudden entrance of Frank Malbone into the court. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> meeting with my young surveyor, and the Chainbearer introduced us {{to each other in}} his usual hearty and frank manner.

60|$|Here, being lodged {{on shore}} by my master's order, I had {{the charge of}} the captain's business, he having seen me very diligent for my own master; and in requital for his mistaken confidence, I found means to secure, that is to say, to steal, about twenty moidores out of the gold that was shipped on board by the merchants, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> adventure.|$|E
60|$|As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> essay, so it {{met with}} the fortune of an {{unfinished}} piece; that is to say, it was damned in private, by the advice of some friends to whom I shewed it; who freely told me, {{that it was an}} excellent subject; but not so artificially wrought, as they could have wished; and now let my enemies make their best of this confession.|$|E
