500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once they arrive, the two cosmonauts sent to Parity {{discover}} that their predecessors have disappeared completely. Before leaving, they {{left a note}} stating that they had made contact with intelligent life from the planet Lesnaya Grud'. Together, they decided to keep their findings private out of fear for the political turmoil that might occur. The inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' had traveled to Parity and transported the two cosmonauts to their home planet. From there, the cosmonauts send a transmission back to Parity describing the planet. It has a much larger population than Earth, nobody has any concept of war, {{and there is an}} established and functional world government. Furthermore, Lesnaya Grud' suffers from the problem of [...] "internal withering," [...] where portions of the planet turn to uninhabitable desert. Although this problem will not be critical for many millions of years, the inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' are already <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> to do about it and how to possibly fix it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaders of}} the Sumter County Movement were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> to do next, and a young activist chose to lead a group to pray in front of city hall. Aelony {{attended}} the march as a non-participant observer and was arrested {{on a charge of}} insurrection against the state of Georgia. This charge carried the death penalty under Georgia’s 1871 Anti-Treason Act. Three other CORE fieldworkers, Ralph Allen, Don Harris, and John Perdew, were arrested in Americus as well. With Aelony, this group became known as the Americus Four while they spent time on death row. Their arrest originally went unnoticed in the United States, but attracted attention in Europe and Africa. As public concern grew, awareness spread within the United States and eventually put pressure on the federal government to attend to the arrests in Georgia. The Americus Four were ultimately exonerated. [...] Shortly afterward, he suffered a myocardial infarction and was hospitalized at Grady Hospital, by a local black physician who cared for the CORE workers. [...] Thus, Aelony integrated the black ward at Grady Hospital. He was examined [...] there by the famous academic cardiologist, Professor Willis Hurst, [...] who felt his heart attack was related to his beating in Ocala, Florida. [...] He was then advised to terminate his dangerous protest work in the deep South.|$|E

6000|$|Various {{circumstances}} {{contributed to}} the poorness of the figure Ashe cut in the opening moments of this interview.

In the second place, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry, he had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl, {{and it was no}} slight matter to change this {{on the spur of the}} moment into a pleasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sitting for half an hour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words: [...] "The Adventure of the Wand of Death," [...] and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> a wand of death might be, has not his mind under proper control.|$|E

It seemed from this account that the suicide was directly after the trial; even before the boy's letter to Nedda had been written. He must surely have heard of it since and given up his mad idea! He leaned over, touched John on the knee, and handed him the paper. John read the paragraph, handed it back; and the two brothers stared fixedly at each other.
