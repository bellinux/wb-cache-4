40|$|The {{effects of}} truncal vagotomy and parietal cell vagotomy on gastric acid {{secretion}} and plasma gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide release were studied in 28 duodenal ulcer patients under basal conditions and after modified sham feeding and infusion of pentagastrin (2 micrograms/kg/h). Before vagotomy gastric acid output in response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding {{was significantly higher}} than basal acid secretion in all subjects tested and reached about 45 % of the pentagastrin maximum. No difference in the increase in acid response, or in the pancreatic polypeptide response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding was found between patients with high and low basal secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration was unaltered by modified sham feeding before and after truncal vagotomy or parietal cell vagotomy, although after vagotomy it tended to reach higher values than before this procedure. After truncal vagotomy, basal pancreatic polypeptide concentration was decreased and modified sham feeding-induced pancreatic polypeptide increment was completely eliminated. Four weeks after parietal cell vagotomy, the modified sham feeding-induced increment in plasma pancreatic polypeptide was significantly decreased and observed only in seven of 12 patients. Four to five years after parietal cell vagotomy all subjects responded <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding with pancreatic polypeptide increment similar to that before vagotomy and in three of 12 patients acid response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding was seen. This study indicates that truncal vagotomy eliminates gastric acid and plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses to vagal excitation while parietal cell vagotomy abolishes gastric acid response and reduces temporarily the pancreatic polypeptide response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding (possibly because of transient impairment of the vagal innervation of the pancreas). (2) A high ratio of basal to maximal acid output in non-operated duodenal ulcer patients is not associated with a low acid response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding, nor with a high pancreatic polypeptide concentration, and (3) Restitution of the pancreatic polypeptide response <b>to</b> <b>modified</b> sham feeding five years after parietal cell vagotomy does not indication ineffective denervation of the parietal cells...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Celiac is an {{autoimmune}} disease caused by of gluten proteins {{which can be}} found in multi-grain food like wheat, barley and oat. The disease affects more than 1 % of population and characterized by intestinal inflammation. In celiac disease, mucosal damage is a dynamic process. It is shown that it has autoimmune components. It is also T-Cell mediated and can be categorised as a chronic inflammatory disease. The {{purpose of this study is}} <b>to</b> make <b>modified</b> Marsh classification of the duodenal biopsies that came to our department in the 10 years. The study deals with reassessment of all events and uncovering the low graded events that were not diagnosed. Material and Methods: 467 biopsies (diagnosed between 2001 and 2011 at the Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology) were taken and analyzed by two pathologists. Each sample was reevaluated without taking the previous reports into consideration and scored by using modified Marsh classification. Results: According <b>to</b> <b>Modified</b> Marsh Classification total of 48 cases were diagnosed as Type 1. Total of 6 cases according <b>to</b> <b>Modified</b> Marsh Classification was diagnosed as Type 2. Total of 11 cases according <b>to</b> <b>Modified</b> Marsh Classification was diagnosed as Type 3 a. Total of 5 cases, according <b>to</b> <b>Modified</b> Marsh Classification, was diagnosed as Type 3 b. Total of 6 cases according <b>to</b> <b>Modified</b> Marsh Classification was diagnosed as Type 3 c. Conclusion: As a result of this study, it has been found that Modified Marsh Classification is a very important standardization tool for detection of suspicious duodenal biopsies and for early case examinations...|$|R
