40|$|Providing {{electricity}} {{to a group}} of remote domestic or industrial customers can be achieved by a grid connection, or by an off-grid (island) generator. While the former can become costly and will likely be prone to disruption, the latter is normally based on fossil fuels, which makes fuel sourcing and transport critical. To overcome these obstacles, a novel micro-scale biomass generation plant was developed. This plant uses locally available renewable biomass feedstock to generate decentralized power at the point of demand and without the necessity of a grid connection. In this paper, load simulations {{on the basis of a}} process simulation model of the plant are performed to achieve a continuous match of supply and demand. It is analysed which load characteristics and fluctuations have to be expected when generating for a remote group of domestic customers, and it is evaluated how the plant needs to be operated to always provide sufficient power. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>system</b> of the plant system is investigated: The plant does not employ electrical storage, but instead matches demand and supply by means of internal usage of heat and power and through fuel storage. Relative and absolute storage levels as well as the storage charge/discharge cycles are analysed, and it will be shown that the plant can easily accommodate severe load fluctuations. Finally, the plant load factors are evaluated, and the findings show that this design is an interesting alternative to common island generators or to a conventional grid connection for remote customers...|$|E

Recent efforts have consolidated <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> and L-Basin has become the SRS site for wet storage of spent nuclear fuels. Corrosion surveillance of coupons in this basin is being performed to provide assurance of safe <b>storage</b> of spent <b>fuel.</b> This paper describes the highlights of recent studies on these aluminum coupons after immersion for more than 7 years in L-Basin. Selected coupons were metallurgically characterized to establish the existence of general corrosion and pitting. Minor pitting corrosion was observed on the intentionally galvanically coupled samples and creviced coupons, thus demonstrating that localized concentration cells were formed during the exposure period. In these cases, the susceptibility to pitting was not attributed to aggressive basin water chemistry but to localized conditions [...] crevices and galvanic coupling [...] that allowed the development of oxygen and/or metal ion concentration cells that produced locally aggressive waters. General corrosion was also observed {{on some of the}} coupons. None of the coupons were pre-oxidized to form a protective oxide as compared to <b>the</b> spent <b>fuel</b> which was oxidized during reactor operations. This enables the coupons to react to basin water chemistry in {{a relatively short period of}} time whereas spent fuel is protected against such reactions.

Generic calculations to determine the distance required to neutronically isolate neighboring fissile regions are reported. Two specific fuels are also addressed, Fort Saint Vrain and Shippingport PWR Core- 2 Seed- 2 (PWR). These fuels are addressed under both dry and flooded conditions. Fort Saint Vrain fuel contains a uranium-graphite fuel matrix, is graphite moderated and has a relatively low {sup 235 }U loading ({approximately} 1 kg per element).

40|$|Hydrogen {{fuel cell}} vehicle safety {{generally}} focuses on three areas of vehicle safety: <b>The</b> <b>fuel,</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>system,</b> and the vehicle itself. This presentation will give an overview using the Opel HydroGen 4, equipped with a 70 MPa compressed hydrogen <b>storage</b> <b>system,</b> as an example [1]. Like any fuel, hydrogen has {{a significant amount of}} chemical energy which will be released upon ignition if an oxidizer such as oxygen is available. In air, mixtures between 4 vol % H 2 (lower flammability limit, LFL) and 74 vol % H 2 (upper flammability limit, UFL) are ignitable [2]. An unintended release of hydrogen itself is not a threat as hydrogen is not toxic, but the possible risk of ignition needs to be considered in the safety assessment. For gasoline-driven vehicles, gasoline fuel leaks can be detected in two ways. First, it is a fluid and leakages are directly visible. Second, gasoline has a characteristic smell so that some discharges may also be detected directly. In contrast, hydrogen gas is invisible and odorless. However, depending on the storage technology, additional signs of leakage may be noticeable [3].

The {{work done}} for this {{dissertation}} {{is based on}} actual thermo–hydraulic design work done during 2002 to 2006 {{on one of the}} subsystems of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor is a proved revolutionary small, compact and safe nuclear power plant. It operates on a direct closed Brayton cycle.

The system is also responsible for discharging spent–fuel spheres to the spent–fuel storage area and recharging the reactor with fresh <b>fuel</b> spheres. <b>The</b> focus of this dissertation is the thermo–hydraulic design of the FHSS system, with specific focus on the FHSS helium circulator, referred to as the FHSS blower. The FHSS blower is a single–stage centrifugal machine, submerged in an enclosed pressure boundary, which forms part of the closed–loop helium pressure boundary. The aim of the dissertation is to simulate all the operating parameters of the system to determine the volumetric flow rate and pressure rise the impeller of the blower has to deliver. Due to the complexity of the simulation model and lack of experimental data a Sensitivity and Monte Carlo study was also done. The output of the study is sufficient thermo–hydraulic data to design all the major components of the FHSS system. For components such as the piping and pressure boundary this includes (i) temperature, (ii) pressure and (iii) heat transfer through the material at all the operating conditions. For the blower it includes; (i) blower mass flow rate, (ii) pressure ratio, (iii) inlet pressure and (iv) inlet temperature at all the operating conditions. Master...|$|R

This study covers a variety of tasks, from the modelling of a single fuel sphere to modelling of the entire Sphere <b>Storage</b> <b>System</b> for the normal and various off-normal conditions, and for the determination of keff values for the system under these conditions. Additional models were also created to investigate the phenomena of clustering of low burnup <b>fuel</b> spheres and <b>the</b> effects of graphite spheres being mixed with <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> spheres in <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> containers. The entire study was done using the SCALE 5. 1 computer code package. SCALE 5. 1 is licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) and is a package that is widely used in the US and around the world to perform criticality safety analyses as well as other nuclear-related calculations. For this study the control module CSAS 6 was specifically used to develop the appropriate models because of its suitability for the modelling of pebble fuel and its advanced geometric modelling capabilities. It also automatically invokes the specific functional modules using the sequence CSAS 26 in order to obtain the appropriate information as required by another functional module KENO-VI, which calculates keff for the specified input models. 3 The results from the models for the various scenarios representing normal and off-normal conditions show that the design of the proposed current design of the Sphere <b>Storage</b> <b>System</b> remains critical safe (keff < 0. 95) for all the plausible scenarios considered.

Criticality calculations with the MCNP code investigated various contingencies for the criticality control parameters. Important contingencies included mix of fuel element types stored, water density due to air bubbles or water level for the over-moderated racks, interaction with existing <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> racks and <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> holsters in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> pool, neutron absorption of planned rack design and materials, and criticality changes due to manufacturing tolerances or damage. Some limitations or restrictions on use of <b>the</b> new <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> rack for storage operations were developed through the criticality analysis and are required to meet the double contingency requirements of criticality safety. As shown in the analysis, this system will remain sub [...] ...|$|R
