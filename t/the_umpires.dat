5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be referred to a committee member. Umpires were introduced {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field referee was introduced for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. <b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team. The concept was later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> became linesmen. The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth {{became a}} member of the {{official}} AL umpire staff in 1999, when multiple call-up umpires were hired to take the place of umpires who had participated in a mass resignation. He began his career on the AL staff, but in 2000 MLB merged <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> from its two leagues. Culbreth wore #42 as an AL umpire, but he had to stop using that number after it was retired in recognition of Jackie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player {{has been able to}} modify his action to appease his critics and <b>the</b> <b>umpires,</b> but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.|$|E

2500|$|... "If [...] runner has {{contact with}} a legally {{occupied}} base when he hinders , he shall not be called out unless, in <b>the</b> <b>umpire’s</b> judgment, such hindrance, whether it occurs on fair or foul territory, is intentional. If <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> declares <b>the</b> hindrance intentional, the following penalty shall apply: With less than two out, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> shall declare both the runner and batter out. With two out, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> shall declare <b>the</b> batter out." ...|$|R
5000|$|The infield fly rule is a {{judgment}} call, as the rule states that [...] "The judgment of <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> must govern". <b>The</b> rule directs <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> to declare an infield fly immediately on determining that the play meets the criteria described above, solely based on <b>the</b> <b>umpire's</b> discretion. Since different umpires {{may have different}} definitions of what constitutes [...] "ordinary effort," [...] the rule may be applied differently depending on <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> and game conditions.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> for {{the series}} were Joe West, Dana DeMuth, Gerry Davis, Brian Gorman, Jeff Nelson, and Mike Everitt. The World Series crew had {{included}} at least 1 umpire who had never worked the World Series in 24 of the past 25 series; however, following several mistakes by umpires in earlier rounds of the playoffs, this crew did not.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Lindwall was {{selected}} as part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up {{to the start of}} the tour. Lindwall was carrying an injured leg tendon and his foot drag in the delivery stride led to murmurings in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who had Lindwall's leg back to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front. Bradman stated his firm belief that Lindwall's delivery was fair. During the lengthy boat journey to England, Bradman emphasized to Lindwall the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual, to avoid being no-balled, and to avoid bowling at full speed until <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> were satisfied with his action. Bradman assured Lindwall that he was an automatic selection for the Tests even if he did not take a wicket in the lead-in tour matches, telling him that being passed by <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> was the first priority. Bradman recalled how Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 tour, destroying his confidence. Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and so it remained for the rest of the tour.|$|E
25|$|In most {{professional}} play and some amateur competition, {{there is an}} officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to as <b>the</b> <b>umpire),</b> who sits in a raised chair {{to one side of}} <b>the</b> court. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> has absolute authority to make factual determinations. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> has <b>the</b> right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> is sure that a clear mistake has been made.|$|R
25|$|If, in <b>the</b> <b>umpire's</b> opinion, {{this is the}} case, and {{the ball}} was a legal {{delivery}} that was caught before touching the ground, then the batsman is given out by <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> {{does not have the}} benefit of the Snickometer, and must instead rely on his senses of sight and hearing, as well as his judgement. When <b>the</b> <b>Umpire</b> DRS (Decision Review System) was introduced to Test Cricket, Snicko was not considered accurate enough, and so another edge detecting tool Hot Spot was used.|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{a runner}} has {{contact with a}} legally {{occupied}} base when he hinders fielder who is attempting to make a play on a batted ball, he shall not be called out unless, in <b>the</b> <b>umpire’s</b> judgment, such hindrance, whether it occurs on fair or foul territory, is intentional. If <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> declares <b>the</b> hindrance intentional, the following penalty shall apply: With less than two out, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> shall declare both the runner and batter out.

5|$|Culbreth has umpired in five Division Series, six League Championship Series, two World Series and one All-Star Game, {{as well as}} the National League's single-game playoff in 2007. He was one of <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> when a Tampa Bay Rays pitcher threw {{a no-hitter}} {{for the first time in}} team history, and he was behind the plate when the New York Mets {{achieved}} the same distinction. Prior to the 2013 Major League Baseball season, Culbreth, Ted Barrett and Jim Joyce became crew chiefs after the retirements of Ed Rapuano, Tim Tschida and Derryl Cousins.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall. Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64, having top-scored in both innings, to leave England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed in the fading light, prompting <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> to call off play. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|Finally, within 36 {{hours of}} a game's {{conclusion}} (including {{the conclusion of a}} suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.|$|E
50|$|McAllister {{also was}} <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> in a July 15, 1900 minor league game between Cleveland and Detroit. After {{hostilities}} with <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>the</b> previous day, Tigers manager Tommy Burns {{feared that the}} crowd would injure umpire Joe Cantillon. Burns forfeited the game, but Cleveland manager Jimmy McAleer agreed to play using reserve player McAllister as <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> Detroit won 6-1.|$|R
5000|$|A {{member of}} the {{defensive}} team may appeal to <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> when a batter bats out of turn. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> then enforces <b>the</b> penalty for batting out of turn, if any. The ball must be live for this as for any appeal. After the appeal is made, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> will usually signal [...] "Time" [...] and figure out whether the appeal is successful.|$|R
50|$|On April 26, 2006, {{while playing}} for the Durham Bulls {{in a game against}} the Pawtucket Red Sox, Young was ejected for arguing a disputed third strike call, and before heading back to the dugout, Young flung his bat underhand, which made contact with <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> After <b>the</b> third-strike call he stared at <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> for some time and refused to leave the batter's box. He finally did, but then started to return to his dugout and the center field camera caught him {{throwing}} his bat underhand, end-over-end, toward <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>The</b> bat hit <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> on his chest and arm but he was not seriously hurt.|$|R
5|$|On April 10, 2014, Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was {{believed}} to have been using pine tar in a Yankee-Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium. This was never brought to <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> attention, therefore it was never tested and no actions were taken. On April 23, 2014, at a Yankee Red Sox game in Fenway Park, John Farrell noticed that Pineda was using pine tar again. Farrell walked to the home plate umpire and got Pineda ejected from the game in the 2nd inning.|$|E
5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of overarm bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were dismayed by the state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported <b>the</b> <b>umpires,</b> finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> {{is allowed}} {{a certain amount}} of {{discretion}} and it is made clear that <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> is <b>the</b> [...] "sole judge" [...] and that [...] "his determination shall be absolute" ...|$|R
5000|$|The ball becomes live {{when the}} pitcher {{is on the}} pitcher's plate ready to pitch; the batter, catcher, and <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> are all ready; and <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> calls or signals [...] "Play".|$|R
50|$|If {{necessary}} {{to make it clear}} to the players that <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> considers <b>the</b> ball to be dead, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> signals dead ball by crossing and uncrossing his arms in front of his body.|$|R
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> answered me.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{declared}} at {{the start}} of the fifth day after a pitch inspection, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>umpires</b> had decided to start play half an hour later than normal, but this was not possible and they helped the ground staff to clean up the wet surface. Bradman chose to use the light roller and play was supposed to begin as soon as the lunch break ended.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
5000|$|The officiating team {{consists}} of one umpire, {{two or more}} line referees and a scorer. When <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> calls [...] "play", if a team refuses to play it forfeits <b>the</b> match. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> is <b>the</b> sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is <b>the</b> <b>umpire's</b> responsibility to call [...] "fault" [...] or [...] "let", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls [...] "fault" [...] and immediately corrects himself and calls [...] "play" [...] but the striker fails to return the ball, a [...] "let" [...] is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and {{one half of the}} side line opposite <b>the</b> <b>umpire,</b> in addition to any other duties assigned by <b>the</b> <b>umpire.</b> Referees signal <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> in a code prescribed by the BFF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} round Ilie Nastase was {{defaulted}} from his match against John McEnroe. <b>The</b> <b>umpire</b> had docked Nastase a point in third set and then a game in the fourth for arguing and stalling. A near riot followed as the crowd disagreed with <b>the</b> <b>umpire's</b> decision, by throwing bear cans and cups on court. The match was eventually restarted with <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> being replaced before McEnroe ran out the winner.|$|R
5000|$|Other umpires {{are called}} base umpires and are {{commonly}} stationed near <b>the</b> bases. (Field <b>umpire</b> is a less-common term.) When two <b>umpires</b> are used, <b>the</b> second <b>umpire</b> is simply <b>the</b> base <b>umpire.</b> This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, {{as well as}} in the middle of the outfield. When three <b>umpires</b> are used, <b>the</b> second <b>umpire</b> is called <b>the</b> first-base <b>umpire</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>umpire</b> is called <b>the</b> third-base <b>umpire,</b> even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands. [...] These two umpires also call checked swings, if asked by <b>the</b> plate <b>umpire</b> (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only <b>the</b> plate <b>umpire</b> can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): <b>the</b> first base <b>umpire</b> for right-handed batters, and <b>the</b> third base <b>umpire</b> for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> will make a [...] "safe" [...] gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.|$|R
5|$|Apart from Pringle, {{who played}} in the First and Second Tests, none of the six new {{selections}} had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance. The side fell to a relatively facile defeat against a West Indies team whose own batsmen failed to dominate; they had no need. Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets {{at a cost of}} 98 runs - despite being hampered early on in the match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being waterlogged and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation to the attention of <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.|$|E
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} to key players {{ahead of the}} tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only made the trip after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon. In addition, his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on ahead of the tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until <b>the</b> <b>umpires</b> were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

2500|$|Law 31: Appeals. If the fielders {{believe a}} batsman is out, they may ask <b>the</b> <b>umpire</b> [...] "How's That?"
