5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned that de Grasse was {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>at</b> least part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he {{was aware of the}} number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Fran√ßais, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E

Rumors circulated throughout 1975 that he might return to Notre Dame, but both he and Devine denied them. He finally decided that December that he would not coach in 1976 despite reportedly being pursued by the New York Jets of the NFL, but would instead host a television show beginning the following fall. His last coaching appearance was with the college players in the annual Chicago College All-Star Game against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers on July 23, 1976 at Chicago's Soldier Field. The game was halted in the second half when a torrential thunderstorm broke out. Fans rushed onto the field, and play was never resumed. It was the last such game ever played.|$|E
