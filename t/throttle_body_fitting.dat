50|$|On the B1 model, {{the four}} fuel {{injectors}} are mounted {{directly into the}} cylinder head above the inlet ports (hence the EFI system {{was referred to as}} port injection), while the B2/A (DFI) model had the more common <b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> Injection (TBI) where the injectors are mounted into the <b>throttle</b> <b>bodies.</b> With different <b>throttle</b> <b>bodies</b> comes a very slight difference in the air box mounting. The intake rubbers on the B1 are smaller than the B2 so a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> swap is not possible without replacing the inlet rubbers. They are also mounted at a 45 degree angle as the port injector openings are in the way.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} {{rated at}} five litres and , was specially made to withstand racing conditions. The block was specially cast and crankcase was fitted with four bolt main bearing caps. The heads were revised with high-flow intake ports and roller rockers. Special connecting rods, crankshafts, and pistons were fitted {{as well as}} a custom exhaust. The key feature though was the fabled Walkinshaw twin <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> inlet manifold, which had been specially developed for the Group A and featured sequential setup with a smaller and larger <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> This was fitted with a restrictor plate on the larger, secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> which actually let less air through than the smaller <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> Some reports have indicated that as much as 50-60 horsepower can be gained from the removal of the restrictor plates.|$|R

50|$|Most fuel {{injected}} vehicles use a pleated paper filter {{element in the}} form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> with ductwork. Older vehicles that use carburetors or <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel injection typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually a few inches high and between 6 in and 16 in in diameter. This is positioned above the carburetor or <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid. The overall unit (filter and housing together) is called the air cleaner.|$|R

50|$|A <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> is {{somewhat}} {{analogous to the}} carburetor in a non-injected engine, although {{it is important to}} remember that a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> is not the same thing as a throttle, and that carbureted engines have throttles as well. A <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> simply supplies a convenient place to mount a throttle in the absence of a carburetor venturi. Carburetors are an older technology, which mechanically modulate the amount of air flow (with an internal throttle plate) and combine air and fuel together (venturi). Cars with fuel injection don't need a mechanical device to meter the fuel flow, since that duty is taken over by injectors in the intake pathways coupled with electronic sensors and computers which calculate how much fuel is needed. However, they do still need a throttle to control the airflow into the engine. The simplest way to do this is to simply remove the carburetor unit, and bolt a simple unit containing a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> and fuel injectors on instead. This is known as <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> injection (called TBI by General Motors and CFI by Ford), and it allows an older engine design to be converted from carburetor to fuel injection without significantly altering the intake manifold design. More complex later designs use intake manifolds, and even cylinder heads, specially designed for the inclusion of injectors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mathematical {{modelling}} of the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{air flow}} {{is one of}} the first steps in generating a generic spark ignition (SI) engine model for control-oriented development. Typically, the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> flow model is subdivided into components: a one-dimensional isentropic flow law, an empirically derived effective area component and a closed plate leakage term. Of these, only the effective area term presents any difficulty. This paper describes the mathematical formulation and analysis of a generic model for the <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> Once the model is formulated, the experimental procedure for the identification and estimation of the numerical values of the elements within the model is described. The primary focus of the analysis procedure is the statistical modelling methods associated with calibrating the effective area term. Non-linear repeated measurement analysis methods are used for this purpose...|$|R
