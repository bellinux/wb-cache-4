40|$|Chaos is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} origins of irreversibility appearing in macroscopic systems, such as N-body systems [1]. Accordingly, stability of the system has been extensively examined nu-merically, especially in anN-body system interacting with short-range potentials. However, numerical irreversibility due <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> errors may behave as if it were a physical irreversibility, although it is not a physical one [2]. The influence of round-off errors should be a more serious problem in an N-body system interacting with 'long-range potentials', e. g., self-gravitating systems [3]. For instance, in a typical star-rich cluster with a million stars, each star feels enough of the granularity of the grav-itational field of the other stars that the consequent perturbations lead to a total loss of memory of the initial conditions of its orbit [4]. However, in N-body simulations, numerical fluctuations due <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> errors could behave as if they were the physical perturbations. Therefore, we have investi-gated numerical irreversibility and instability of the self-gravitating system, through the Loschmidt reversibility paradox based on a velocity inversion technique [5]. Consequently, the memory loss time, when the simulated trajectory completely forgets its initial conditions, increases approximately linearly with the Lyapunov time. Because of long-range attractive potentials, such a self-gravitating system exhibits several peculia...|$|R
40|$|The reduced basis {{method is}} a model {{reduction}} technique yielding substantial savings of computational time when a solution to a parametrized equation has to be computed for many values of the parameter. Certification of the approximation is possible {{by means of an}} a posteriori error bound. Under appropriate assumptions, this error bound is computed with an algorithm of complexity independent {{of the size of the}} full problem. In practice, the evaluation of the error bound can become very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> errors. We propose herein an explanation of this fact. A first remedy has been proposed in [F. Casenave, Accurate a posteriori error evaluation in the reduced basis method. C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris 350 (2012) 539 [...] 542. ]. Herein, we improve this remedy by proposing a new approximation of the error bound using the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM). This method achieves higher levels of accuracy and requires potentially less precomputations than the usual formula. A version of the EIM stabilized with respect <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> errors is also derived.

It is shown that the CKF may become completely unreliable when the original plant is unstable, and that this is easily circumvented by a number of techniques. The square root filters, often quoted to possess a conditioning or sensitivity that is the square root of that of the CKF, are shown to possess this property only for the computation of the covariance of the filtered signal and not for the computation of the Kalman gain or the filtered estimate.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} the shearing box approximation {{for the study of the}} dynamics of accretion disks in the Athena magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code. Second-order Crank-Nicholson time differencing is used for the Coriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equation for accuracy and stability. We show this approach conserves energy for epicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> error. In the energy equation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an effective potential in a way which guarantees that total energy (including the gravitational potential energy) is also conserved <b>to</b> <b>round-off</b> error. We introduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport to preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This algorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes the truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the shearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary to conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle similar corrections are also required to conserve mass, momentum and energy, however in practice we find the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than 0. 03 % over hundreds of orbits.
