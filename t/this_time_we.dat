25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> are asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, even though we are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E

500|$|The {{failure of}} {{successive}} Indonesian counterinsurgency campaigns led the Indonesian military elite to instruct {{the commander of}} the Dili-based Sub regional Military Resort Command, Colonel Purwanto to initiate peace talks with Fretilin commander Xanana Gusmão in a Fretilin-controlled area in March 1983. When Xanana sought to invoke Portugal and the UN in the negotiations, ABRI Commander Benny Moerdani broke the ceasefire by announcing a new counterinsurgency offensive called [...] "Operational Clean-Sweep" [...] in August 1983, declairing, [...] "This time no fooling around. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> are going to hit them without mercy." ...|$|E

500|$|Over 2014, Maroon 5 {{continued}} their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin {{and others to}} release their fifth studio album, entitled V. Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: [...] "We developed a really nice system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> kept it going but looked for different types of songs." [...] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon 5 World Tour 2015, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had {{spent so much time}} looking at computers and grids, we were like, that's enough, we can't do that any more. <b>This</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> used computers, but they had to actually be in the room with all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E
500|$|Reality Entertainment, an {{independent}} film company Matti co-founded, co-produced On the Job with Star Cinema. Dondon Monteverde, co-founder of Reality Entertainment, {{said that many}} studios were impressed by the script but were reluctant to finance an expensive action film. The production team considered reducing the film's budget, but decided not to, hoping to shift away from making low-budget films; Monteverde recalled arguing that it was [...] "really {{time to do something}} big-budget and showcase it, rather than making something small and claiming budgetary restrictions. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> didn't give ourselves any excuses. We went all the way". The production cost for the film amounted to ₱47 million (about US$1.1 million in 2013).|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin's main studio {{had both}} analog and digital equipment, a 60ft x 70ft x 18ft live room, and three {{isolation}} booths, for vocals, piano, and drums. The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48-track recorders and transferred {{them to a}} Sony digital recorder. For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though we used a sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish. See, the last record was all done with a Synclavier. But <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> tried to keep it all live and raw." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with Rap-Up, when talking about the video portraying him as a heartbreaker, Cruz said [...] "No, not really. I suppose maybe 20%. It was more of just playing a character and having fun, just going out there and making a real cool, fun, cocky video. Not everyone has seen the whole plot of the video, but it's actually myself and my girlfriend both going out with the intention of breaking everyone's hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of their second Star-Club visit from 1–14 November 1962, Starr had become the group's drummer. The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania (Detlev-Bremer-Strasse 8), having the luxury of single rooms for the first time, and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific (Neuer Pferdemarkt 30) for another booking from 18–31 December 1962. Harrison said: [...] "We came back to play the Star-Club, a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had a hotel. I {{remember}} it was quite a long walk from the club, {{at the top of the}} Reeperbahn going back towards the city." [...] Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted [...] "King Size" [...] Taylor of the Dominoes, another group playing at the club. The tapes were released on West Germany's Bellaphon label in 1977 as The Beatles: Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962, and subsequently re-released in various formats and titles.|$|E

500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E
500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> don't know what the future holds. But there is one thing we know for sure. That when a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Nimrod, Green Day {{explained}} to Cavallo {{their desire to}} create a more experimental album as the band had grown tired of its traditional three chord song structure. [...] Armstrong drew inspiration from The Clash's landmark record London Calling, and referred to Nimrod as [...] "the record I've wanted to make since the band started." [...] The album was intended to break the constraints of typical punk rock music. [...] To preserve the quality of his songwriting, Armstrong began writing each song on acoustic guitar, to which the rest of the band would later add heavier instrumentation and faster tempos. [...] Green Day recorded around 30 songs for Nimrod and picked 18 of them for the record. Dirnt explained that the recording was much more loosely structured than previous albums, and that creating songs was the focus as opposed to making a cohesive record. [...] He observed, [...] "We've always screwed around with different types of music during our jams, but we'd say, 'OK let's stop and get back to the album.' <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> just let them come up." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> can take the right tyres, we were always {{a little bit on}} the wrong side – it’s not easy, but I hope we will manage to get it right this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|The post-hardcore {{sound of}} Box Car Racer {{inspired}} {{the change in}} tone and experimental nature the band approached Blink-182 with. Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: [...] "Before, we got one guitar sound that we changed a little bit through the record. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> want to try a whole different setup for each song." [...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as}} the first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with Box Car Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like we made a mistake <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> felt bad about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E
