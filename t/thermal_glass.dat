40|$|Many {{optical and}} other {{nonlinear}} media {{are governed by}} dispersive, or diffractive, wave equations, for which initial jump discontinuities are resolved into a dispersive shock wave. The dispersive shock wave smooths the initial discontinuity and is a modulated wavetrain consisting of solitary waves at its leading edge and linear waves at its trailing edge. For integrable equations the dispersive shock wave solution can be found using Whitham modulation theory. For nonlinear wave equations which are hyperbolic outside the dispersive shock region, the amplitudes of the solitary waves {{at the leading edge}} and the linear waves at the trailing edge of the dispersive shock can be determined. In this paper an approximate method is presented for calculating the amplitude of the lead solitary waves of a dispersive shock for general nonlinear wave equations, even if these equations are not hyperbolic in the dispersionless limit. The approximate method is validated using known dispersive shock solutions and then applied to calculate approximate dispersive shock solutions for equations governing nonlinear optical media, such as nematic liquid crystals, <b>thermal</b> <b>glasses</b> and colloids.

40|$|Dynamical {{heterogeneities}} {{have been}} introduced {{in the context of}} the glass transition of molecular liquids and the lengthscale associated with them has been argued to be at the origin of the observed quasi-universal behaviour of glassy systems. Dense amorphous packings of granular media and foams also exhibit slow dynamics, intermittency and heterogeneities. We review a number of recent experimental studies of these systems, where one has direct access to the relevant space-time dynamics, allowing for direct visualisations of the dynamical heterogeneities. On one hand these visualisations provide a unique opportunity to access the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the growth of dynamical correlations. On the other hand focussing on the differences in these heterogeneities in microscopically different systems allows to discuss the range of the analogies between molecular <b>thermal</b> <b>glasses</b> and athermal glasses such as granular media and foams.
