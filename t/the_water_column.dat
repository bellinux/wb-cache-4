5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E

5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, usually at {{the top layer of}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> They are found only where there is an intact riparian area, as this is a major source of their food.

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> {{while others have}} developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, buffering them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E

50|$|Black {{rockfish}} are pelagic, that is, {{they occur}} on the continental shelf. Like other pelagic fish, they {{spend most of their}} time amid <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> and are generally associated with rougher terra. This can make it somewhat inconvenient for commercial fisheries, which are often situated in nearshore, shallow water, and rocky areas (reefs). They make up an important component of nearshore fisheries in Southeastern Alaska.|$|R
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
40|$|Fe isotope {{ratios and}} {{concentrations}} of dissolved Fe (Fedis, SPM) from a depth {{profile in the}} Eastern Gotland Basin, Baltic Sea, show a sharp gradient in &delta; 56 Fedis across the suboxic interface with &delta; 56 Fedis = &minus; 0. 4 &permil; in the euxinic deep basin and &delta; 56 Fedis = + 0. 3 &permil; in <b>the</b> oxic upper <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> isotopic gradient overlaps with a strong concentration gradient of Fedis, a concentration maximum in FeSPM and lower &delta; 56 FeSPM values than &delta; 56 Fedis. These features indicate preferential loss of light Fe isotopes into suspended iron-oxyhydroxides (FeIOH) during typical oxidative precipitation across the redox interface in the marine environment. The sign of the fractionation, &Delta; 56 FeFe_IOH&ndash;Fe(II) (aq) 56 FeFe_IOH&ndash;Fe(II) (aq) > 0 &permil;. The difference {{appears to be the}} result of isotope exchange dominated by reaction kinetics in <b>the</b> marine <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> rather than equilibrium fractionation generally inferred for oxidative Fe precipitation elsewhere. High residual &delta; 56 Fedis immediately above the suboxic interface and throughout <b>the</b> oxic <b>water</b> <b>column</b> suggest that any potential Fe export from reducing waters or sediments into <b>the</b> open <b>water</b> <b>column</b> is enriched in the heavy isotopes. Within the suboxic to euxinic deep basin the decreasing &delta; 56 FeSPM trend with depth and a generally low &delta; 56 Fedis are comparable to trends in marine anoxic sediment profiles indicative of microbial reductive Fe dissolution. This confirms supply of dissolved Fe to <b>the</b> euxinic <b>water</b> <b>column</b> mainly from reductive dissolution of settling particles...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts may spawn in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners {{are mostly}} limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards {{the surface and}} release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators {{and allow them to}} {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic larvae {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} such as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, spring seeps and temporary waters (vernal pools). The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, which are often strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf shredders, algal grazers, or collectors of particles from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> and benthos.
