The last shot where Parshya returns home wearing dark glasses, waving to his family and friends from the boat was widely appreciated by film critics.|$|E

500|$|On Memorial Day {{weekend in}} 2006, Cher called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal {{endorsing}} Operation Helmet, {{a group that}} provides helmets to help soldiers avoid head injuries while in the war zone. On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. They do what they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E

But <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> come up with is an assistant government whip". Tony Lloyd, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, called the rebellion a [...] "bit of a sideshow", and Emily Thornberry MP called Brown the [...] "best qualified" [...] to lead Britain through the economic crisis of 2008. The Labour Party said that it had received letters from a small number of MPs asking why no nomination papers had been released. David Miliband continued to show his support for Brown {{in the face of the}} challenge in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon.|$|E
500|$|When {{the book}} was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. [...] The {{first part of the}} novel {{concerns}} the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. [...] Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. [...] One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. [...] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. [...] This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of [...] "fine folks" [...] being people with good sense who do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> with what they have. [...] The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.|$|E

The Kennel Club defended the lack of health testing requirements, saying that it would drive breeders away from the Club. The president of the British Veterinary Association Nick Blayney agreed with the Kennel Club, stating that [...] "if it becomes too reactionary and loses the support of the majority, it would cease to have any influence.

2500|$|The IDF {{was heavily}} {{criticized by the}} Israeli press. The {{headline}} of Maariv read [...] "Foul-Up in the North - A Blow to the Army".
