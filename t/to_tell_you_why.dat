60|$|I {{have no time}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> this is so; nor do I know why, altogether; but so it is.|$|E
60|$|LESBIA [sitting {{down with}} The Times in her hand] Well, it has nerved me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I'm {{going to be}} an old maid.|$|E
6000|$|... (Holding out hand.) Well, so long. I've got to trot, and I haven't time <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I think {{political}} action {{would destroy the}} trade union movement.|$|E
6000|$|I:3:13 [...] SOL. [...] I {{sent for}} <b>thee,</b> [...] <b>To</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>why</b> I sent for thee; yet why, [...] Alas! I know not. Was it but to look [...] Alone upon {{the face that}} once was mine? [...] This morn it was so grave. O! was it woe, [...] Or but indifference, that {{inspired}} that brow [...] That seemed so cold and stately? Was it hate? [...] O! tell me anything, but that to thee [...] I am a thing of nothingness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to be quite frank with you, Mr. Coulson," [...] the Inspector continued. [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> exactly <b>why</b> I have come to see you again tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{knew how}} you would feel about it, {{and that was why}} I didn't dare <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>why</b> we fixed up this story about old Brackett. I couldn't bear to live on you any longer, and to see you {{roughing}} it here, when we might be having all the money we wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] she said. [...] "You speak now {{of things}} {{which you do}} not understand. I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I would not let them kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I've hurt you. Oh, I'm sorry. Your {{asking me}} makes such a difference. They {{are not in}} earnest. But, Russ, I had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I couldn't be engaged to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{smiled in}} a {{significant}} fashion. [...] "It's our friend's affair, and I guess he's not going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> he did it. Still, in one sense, I 'most think {{it was up to}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may help}} yourself," [...] she {{directed}} carelessly. [...] "Perhaps {{then you will}} be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have come in such a state." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} a ghost," [...] she said. [...] "You have been overworking {{yourself}} ridiculously. Now, will you be so good as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{have never been to}} see us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not intend}} to be communicative, I can see," [...] said Wolfenden, after a brief pause, [...] "but I wish I could persuade <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{attempted}} his life to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{as the young}} man grasped his hand, [...] "you want me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> your eyes are bloodshot, why your cheeks burn, and your hand is dry and hot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirty seconds is {{not long}} enough," [...] Da Souza answered, [...] "for me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I decline to go. Better {{listen to me}} quietly, my friend. It will be best for you. Afterwards you will admit it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we are quits," [...] said Bray. [...] "And you {{now know}} my real name. I only came here <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I could not answer your letter the same day. I never got it--I mean," [...] he added hurriedly, [...] "another man got it first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clearly--you had a {{right to}} speak, but only to me. You had no right to {{contradict}} my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool," [...] said Lydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, [...] "Is it possible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of any use for me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> again <b>why</b> we must try to part with the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|AMERICAN. [Pausing in the {{deglutition}} of his eggs--affably] Pardon me, sir; I'd like <b>to</b> have <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{called that}} {{little bit of a}} feller [...] "Herr Ober." [...] Reckon you would know what that means? Mr. Head Waiter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had first}} thought of writing you a letter, Mr. Flint," [...] he said, [...] "but {{it seemed to}} me that, {{considering}} your relations with my father, the proper thing to do was to come <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I cannot take the pass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, then it 'll shore {{turn out}} happy," [...] he said, {{squeezing}} her hand. His smile was grateful, {{but there was}} nothing in it of the victory he hinted at. Some of his ruddy color had gone. [...] "An' now I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I come." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{minister}} rose. [...] "Then I really mustn't detain you, I suppose. Good-bye." [...] He {{offered his}} hand. Colville took it, {{but could not}} let it go at once. [...] "I would like extremely <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I'm leaving Florence in such haste. But I don't see what good it would do, for I don't want you to persuade me to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I dared,' said Mrs Todgers, perceiving this, 'to violate a {{confidence}} {{which has been}} reposed in me, and <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I must beg of you to leave the little door between your room and mine open tonight, I think you would be interested. But I mustn't do it, for I promised Mr Jinkins faithfully, that I would be as silent as the tomb.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he retorted, with a {{violence}} that surprised him. [...] "I {{will not let}} you pass till you have listened <b>to</b> me--till <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> treat me so. I won't stand it--I've had enough {{of this kind of}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have seen}} {{you on the}} road on your wheel, and some one told me who you were. And now, since you have been so kind to me, I am going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> exactly <b>why</b> I cannot ask you to stop at our house. Everything is all wrong there to-day, and if I don't explain what has happened, {{you might think that}} things are worse than they really are, and I wouldn't want anybody to think that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatrice has prejudiced {{you against}} me," [...] she murmured. [...] "It is not fair. Please come and sit down--for five minutes," [...] she pleaded. [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have quarrelled with that funny little man, Mr. Dowling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> he came--why we came. It was {{something}} {{that we did not}} wish to enter into, and at first my husband refused outright. But when I saw him, and thought it over, I did not see how we could refuse. After all, it is something you must have expected, and that you must have been expecting at once, if you say--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not right yet," [...] said Davis. [...] "There's {{another thing}} I {{want to tell}} you first. You know what you said about my children? I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> it hit me so hard; I kind of think you'll feel bad about it too. It's about my little Adar. You hadn't ought to have quite said that--but of course I know you didn't know. She--she's dead, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{waited a}} little, {{struggling}} to control {{herself on the}} brink of the terrible revelation that was coming. Her eyes dropped before his; her heart beat faster and faster; but she struggled bravely. With a desperate courage she faced the position. [...] "If you are ready to listen," [...] she went on, [...] "I am ready <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I insisted on having the police officer sent out of the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Rosa, I do not {{understand}} this at all, and I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> were so extravagantly glad when you found my brother George was coming here, and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> were so overcome by your emotions when you heard of his engagement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, {{this is a}} most courteous offer," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch; [...] "but may I pray of your candour, most noble duke, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{dispose of}} a ward of so much wealth on a {{stranger}} like me, who may leave you to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Queen {{does not}} know me yet," [...] said Ozma, [...] "but I {{want you to know}} me, Lady Aurex, and I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you,</b> and all the Skeezers, are unhappy. Do not fear Coo-ee-oh's anger, for she cannot hear a word we say, I assure you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is, then. It {{begins with}} 'beware' written three times, and in much larger {{characters}} {{than the rest}} of the writing. BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE! Chris Dunbar, I intend to destroy you. I have already made two attempts upon your life, and failed. I shall yet succeed. So sure am I that I shall succeed that I dare to tell you. I do not need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why.</b> In your own heart you know. The wrong you are doing--And here it abruptly ends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{trying very}} hard to get those legs out of sight. [...] "Chug-a-rum! I always like to do {{something}} for those who do something for me, and I suppose now that I ought <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries. I would, if Peter Rabbit were here. If I tell you the story, Peter will be sure to hear of it, and then he will give me no peace until I tell it to him, and I don't like to tell stories twice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lieut thinks different," [...] said Lasky. [...] "He'd be {{only too}} glad to soak you; for you've always been too slick to get nicked before. Orders {{is out to}} get you, and if I were you I'd beat it and beat it quick. I don't have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I'm handing you this, but it's all I can do for you. Now take my advice and make {{yourself}} scarce, though you'll have to go some to make your get-away now--every man on the force has your description by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Harût," [...] I {{answered}} with an unconcerned yawn, [...] "when the guests come {{in such a}} doubtful fashion {{and in the middle}} of the night. But as you are here at last, will you be so good as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have kept us waiting all this time? Is that your way of fulfilling an engagement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was {{something}} I wanted: yes, I remember now,' said the lad. 'I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> fought like the champions and giants {{in the stories}} and for so little a thing. Are you indeed a man like us? Are you not rather an old wizard who lives among these hills, and will not a wind arise presently and crumble you into dust?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is trying}} to come between you and me, Elsa," [...] said Andor, {{who was trying to}} keep his violent rage in check. [...] "She tried to come between you and Béla, and chose an ugly method to get at what she wanted. She hates <b>you</b> [...] . . . <b>why</b> I don't know, but she does hate you, and she always tries to do you harm. Don't listen <b>to</b> her, I <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Why!</b> just look at her now! [...] . . . the girl is half mad." ...|$|R
