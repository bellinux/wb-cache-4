This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|E
25|$|The {{absolute}} value {{is closely related}} to the idea of distance. As noted above, the {{absolute value}} of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{second major}} reason for the {{difference}} in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's equatorial bulge (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be farther from the planet's centre than objects at the poles.

The length of an eight was assumed to be twenty yards and as such the course came to be described as ‘about 1 mile and 550 yards (2112 metres)’, which was the distance covered by an eight.|$|E
25|$|The {{impossibility of}} faster-than-light {{relative}} speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal (faster-than-light) travel {{by ensuring that}} {{the speed of light}} is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> outside the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole.

25|$|A {{receiver}} {{listening for}} these signals and displaying them on an oscilloscope {{will see a}} series of blips on the display. By measuring <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> the delay between the two signals can be calculated. For instance, a receiver might measure {{the distance between the}} two blips to represent a delay of 0.5ms. This implies that the difference in the distance to the two stations is 150km. In this case there are an infinite number of locations where that delay could be measured – 75km from one station and 225 from the other, or 150km from one and 300 from the other, and so on.|$|E

25|$|In {{elliptic}} geometry, {{two lines}} perpendicular {{to a given}} line must intersect. In fact, the perpendiculars on one side all intersect at the absolute pole of the given line. The perpendiculars {{on the other side}} also intersect at a point, which is different from the other absolute pole only in spherical geometry, for in elliptic geometry the poles on either side are the same. There are no antipodal points in elliptic geometry. Every point corresponds to an absolute polar line of which it is the absolute pole. Any point on this polar line forms an absolute conjugate pair with the pole. Such a pair of points is orthogonal, and <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is a quadrant.|$|E
25|$|The fish swim in a grid where <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is {{the same}} as the jump length of their prey, as {{indicated}} in the animation above right. In the animation, juvenile herring hunt the copepods in this synchronised way. The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure wave of an approaching herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herring allows a herring to eventually snap the copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into {{scattered}} cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> was such {{that they could not}} mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the Battle of Trenton, and the concurrent Battle of Princeton. While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts. Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.|$|E
