5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a <b>treadle</b> used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a <b>treadle</b> to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
25|$|A UK offset {{provider}} set up {{a carbon}} offsetting scheme that {{set up a}} secondary market for <b>treadle</b> pumps in developing countries. These pumps are used by farmers, using human power, in place of diesel pumps. However, given that <b>treadle</b> pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water, while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes, {{it is not clear}} that the <b>treadle</b> pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions. Other companies have explored and rejected <b>treadle</b> pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the attractions}} of an e-spinner {{is that it}} is not {{necessary}} to coordinate <b>treadling</b> with handling the fiber (drafting), so it is generally easier to learn to spin on an e-spinner than a traditional treadle-style spinning wheel.

Lawson in 1876. Some inventors even combined <b>treadles</b> and chains on the same bicycle.|$|R

25|$|One of Ma Jun's early inventions was an {{improved}} silk drawloom, which, according to Fu Xuan, earned Ma Jun considerable recognition for his innovative skill. In his time, silk looms generally had fifty heddles and fifty <b>treadles,</b> some even up to sixty of each. Ma Jun crafted a loom that had only twelve <b>treadles,</b> {{which not only}} made the process faster and more efficient, but also allowed the weaving of new intricate patterns.|$|R

25|$|Stationary {{machinery}} {{such as the}} bodger pole lathe {{have been}} in use for several thousands of years (since at least the bronze age) and exactly the same reciprocating <b>treadle</b> mechanism, with somewhat more advanced mechanics, was adapted to sewing machines as patented by Isaac Singer in 1851.|$|E
500|$|In {{the field}} of {{manufacturing}} textiles, Joseph Needham (1900–1995) wrote that the Chinese invented the quilling-wheel by the 12th century, and wrote the mechanical belt drive was known since the 11th century. Qin Guan's book Can Shu (Book of Sericulture) of 1090 described a silk-reeling machine with an oscillating 'proto-flyer', as the apparatus of the main reel of which the silk is bound is wound and powered by <b>treadle</b> motion. In this device the ramping arm of the flyer was activated simultaneously by a subsidiary belt drive. This machine was portrayed in an illustration of the Geng Zhi Tu book of 1237, and again a more elaborate illustration was provided in a 17th-century book. Qin Guan's 1090 book stated that: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} {{equipped}} with Sykes [...] "lock and block" [...] interlocking, which prevented signalmen allowing a second train onto a section before the previous train had left. The interlocking was normally released by trains passing over track <b>treadles</b> {{as they entered the}} next section. To allow for mechanical breakdowns, the signalman had a special key to override the interlocking and as some of the <b>treadles</b> in the St Johns area were not completely reliable it had become necessary to occasionally use this facility.|$|R

500|$|By December 1874, only 400typewriters {{had been}} sold, {{due in part}} to their high price and poor reliability. As {{businesses}} were slow to adopt the machine, authors, clergymen, lawyers and newspaper editors were the targeted customers. Individuals, however, generally did not write enough to justify the machine's price of about $125, the average annual income per person at the time. There were exceptions, however; Mark Twain {{was among the first to}} purchase the machine, which he termed a [...] "curiosity breeding little joker". Although the machine was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, it was overshadowed by Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. Several design and manufacturing improvements followed—including replacing the <b>treadle</b> with a hand lever—and 4,000machines had been sold by 1877. In 1878, Remington outsourced marketing to E. & T. Fairbanks & Company, a scale manufacturer, as marketing to that point had produced only lackluster sales.|$|E
500|$|As mentioned, {{the main}} {{production}} batch of Southern-built locomotives {{differed from the}} two prototypes, Channel Packet and Union Castle. [...] The steam-operated firehole door <b>treadle</b> was removed, and {{a new type of}} boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. [...] Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet blastpipe, which failed to be caught by the air flow. [...] After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst side smoke deflector plates were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included mounting lugs for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} drilled and tapped. Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid handwheel instead of the larger heavier spoked handwheel used on machines sold as <b>treadles.</b> The spoked handwheel is better for <b>treadles</b> because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid handwheel is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the early}} velocipedes there were designs with one, two, three, four, and even five wheels. Some two-wheeled designs had pedals {{mounted on the}} front wheel, while three- and four-wheeled designs {{sometimes}} used <b>treadles</b> and levers to drive the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Home and {{starting}} banner signals were used, electrically controlled, for each direction.Trains were, {{at that time}} uniquely, controlled by a development of the Syke's 'lock and block' system whereby the trains operated <b>treadles</b> on the single line {{to interact with the}} block instruments.|$|R
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot <b>treadle.</b> When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E
2500|$|As a foot <b>treadle,</b> {{the machine}} mounts in a cabinet {{about the size}} of an adult schooldesk. [...] The <b>treadle</b> pad is built into the cabinet's base right at the user's feet. [...] A round leather [...] "treadle belt" [...] passes up from the <b>treadle,</b> up through the cabinet, over the {{handwheel}} by following the belt groove, back down through the cabinet again, and then back to the <b>treadle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early {{electric}} conversions {{consisted of}} mounting a motor in the <b>treadle</b> cabinet. [...] The <b>treadle</b> belt was shortened to run {{only from the}} motor's pulley to the handwheel.

40|$|It {{may seem}} logical that sources of design {{inspiration}} among integer sequences should be sought among the complex, the unusual, {{and even the}} exotic. In fact, other articles in this series have explored these areas [1 - 2]. But relatively simple integer sequences contain hidden within them fascinating patterns {{that can be used}} to advantage in design, and in particular for threading and <b>treadling</b> sequences in weaving drafts. Consider the squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, … There are many interesting number theoretic aspects to the squares, including the fact that all positive integers can be represented as the sum of four squares. Nevertheless, the squares don’t have any obvious attractive characteristics that might be useful in weave design. And since they increase in magnitude rapidly, they seem far from the realm of threading and <b>treadling</b> sequences — t-sequences. It is necessary to “tame ” such sequences to bring them into the domain of t-sequences — to reduce the large numbers to the realm of the shafts and <b>treadles</b> that are available on looms. The natural way to do this, which preserves many of their intrinsic properties, is modular reduction, which is treated in detail in another article [3]. The basic idea is to take remainders on division by a number, called the modulus. These remainders are then adjusted to start at 1 rather than 0 to conform to the convention for numbering shafts and <b>treadles.</b> The result is a residue sequence that is suitable for threading and <b>treadling.</b> There is another problem to consider. Residue sequences often are missing values. For example, the residue sequence for the squares modulo 2 is 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, … repeated One way to handle this problem is to reassign the values to fill in the gaps. A systematic way has useful properties is called normalization [4]. Normalization reassigns successive value to the integers in order: 1, 2, 3, …. The normalized sequence for the example above is 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, … repeated Here are three normalized residue sequences for the squares, with two repeats shown in graphical format: squares mod 2...|$|R
5000|$|Besides being {{far easier}} to handle, the wax {{recording}} medium also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. [...] Additionally the Graphophones initially deployed foot <b>treadles</b> to rotate the recordings, then wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms, and finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank on Edison's phonograph.|$|R
50|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power loom. It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or <b>treadles,</b> operate the loom it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the loom are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. The cast metal chair, manufactured along with the loom, can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver <b>treadles</b> the loom. There is an example in the Bradford Industrial Museum.|$|R
