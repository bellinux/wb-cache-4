5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. <b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E

25|$|The Baeyer–Villiger {{oxidation}} is {{an organic}} reaction that forms an ester from a ketone or a lactone from a cyclic ketone, using peroxyacids or peroxides as the oxidant.

25|$|More useful is the E1 {{elimination}} {{reaction of}} alcohols to produce alkenes. <b>The</b> <b>reaction,</b> <b>in</b> general, obeys Zaitsev's Rule, {{which states that}} the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed.

25|$|In {{the case}} of an open circuit, the {{electric}} charge that has been separated by the mechanism generating the emf creates an electric field opposing the separation mechanism. For example, <b>the</b> chemical <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> a voltaic cell stops when the opposing electric field at each electrode is strong enough to arrest <b>the</b> <b>reactions.</b> A larger opposing field can reverse <b>the</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> what are called reversible cells.|$|R
25|$|Sodium amide can be {{prepared}} by the reaction of sodium with ammonia gas, but it is usually prepared by <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> liquid ammonia using iron(III) nitrate as a catalyst.

25|$|Hot-processed soaps {{are created}} by {{encouraging}} the saponification reaction by adding heat to speed up <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b> <b>In</b> contrast with cold-pour soap which is poured into molds {{and for the most}} part only then saponifies, hot-process soaping for the most part saponifies the oils completely and only then is poured into molds.|$|E
25|$|For {{reversible}} reactions, {{changes in}} the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.

25|$|In {{the case}} where a {{directing}} group, denoted at the right by DG, is present near multiple aliphatic C-H groups the catalyst will oxidize the C-H bond closest to the directing group.

25|$|In {{the context}} of chemistry, energy is an {{attribute}} of a substance {{as a consequence of}} its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in {{one or more of these}} kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.|$|E

By early April, in areas north of the Loire, order had been restored by the revolutionary government, but south of the Loire in four departments that became known as the Vendée militaire there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility.|$|E

25|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} exist demonstrating how {{in certain}} autocatalytic reaction systems {{the presence of}} a small amount of reaction product with enantiomeric excess {{at the start of the}} reaction can result in a much larger enantiomeric excess at the end of <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b> <b>In</b> the Soai reaction, pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Scheme 1) is alkylated by diisopropylzinc to the corresponding pyrimidyl alcohol. Because the initial reaction product is also an effective catalyst the reaction is autocatalytic. The presence of just 0.2 equivalent of the alcohol S-enantiomer at the start of the reaction is sufficient to amplify the enantiomeric excess to 93%.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b> <b>In</b> addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E
25|$|In steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid {{hydrocarbon}} feed like naphtha, LPG or ethane is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without {{the presence of}} oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> a transfer line heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.|$|E
