25|$|Ōkyo's {{first major}} {{commission}} came in 1768 from Yūjō, abbot of a temple in Ōtsu called Enman'in. Over {{the next three}} years, Ōkyo painted The Seven Misfortunes and Seven Fortunes, a depiction {{of the results of}} both bad and good karma. The three scrolls total about 148ft (45m) in length. Ōkyo tried to find models for the people depicted in them, even for the shocking images such as a man being ripped in two by frightened bulls. His introduction to the work states that he believed that people needed to see reality, not imaginary images of Nirvana or Hell, if they were to <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> in Buddhist principles.|$|E

I don't think he got a fair trial." [...] After his execution, Chandler was {{described}} as the [...] "loneliest man in the loneliest place on earth, death row"; he did not receive a single visitor during his years in Florida's death row unit.|$|E
500|$|The joke, {{which plays}} on the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "fishsticks" [...] and [...] "fish dicks" [...] when spoken, becomes a hit throughout South Park. When Cartman begins taking half credit for the joke, Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to Cartman. When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that he deserves credit.|$|E

500|$|On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica. In 1963, a four-season {{starting}} quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica {{left for the}} Raiders. Lamonica felt he [...] "...learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. [...] And I <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills." [...] In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns. The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in [...] weather. [...] During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because, Stone said, [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really going to do a whole episode about this?" [...] Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though they {{had nothing to do with}} it. Stone said, [...] "They <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden {{spoke of}} the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional {{committees}} including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia, which he feels he played a role in ending. Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say what they will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action. Who among us is going to be able to, on Day 1, step in and end the war?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Mele formulates {{an example}} of the [...] "static" [...] paradox as the following:If ever a person A deceives a person B into believing that something, p, is true, A knows or <b>truly</b> <b>believes</b> that p is false while causing B to believe that p is true. So when A deceives A (i.e., himself) into believing that p is true, he knows or <b>truly</b> <b>believes</b> that p is false while causing himself to believe that p is true. Thus, A must {{simultaneously}} believe that p is false and believe that p is true. But how is this possible? ...|$|R

500|$|In July 2011, {{a report}} by {{consultancy}} EC Harris found that Saudi Arabia is the cheapest country in the Middle East to build in, half as expensive as Bahrain, and 34% cheaper than the United Arab Emirates, where Burj Khalifa is located. The future towers' site is located in very close proximity to King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, whose runways nearly align with the towers' site, which will {{have an effect on}} the airspace. While skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre, even two kilometres (6,562 feet) high, are technically buildable, physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height. From a real estate perspective, it is considered virtually impossible to create enough demand to justify such a tower, but that at some point someone with a great excess of money will likely do it anyway. As for physical restraints, Bart Leclercq, head of structures for WSP Middle East recently said, [...] "I <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that 1 mile—1.6 kilometres—is within range. Over that, it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality. But 2km is too big a figure –it's just a step too far at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> in what he is saying. Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency would have been like.|$|E
