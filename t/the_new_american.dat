5|$|In {{addition}} to Long's extensive journal, he wrote {{on a variety}} of other subjects. During his unsuccessful attempt to start a law practice in Buckfield he produced a paper on Congressional power and slavery. While in Boston in the early 1860s he had a play produced locally.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> {{also brings}} to light {{many of the}} {{difficulties}} the immigrants face {{in the process of}} leaving their homeland and arriving in America. The book shows that the immigrants face problems such as racism, difficulty finding a job, difficulty acculturating, and the overwhelming sadness of leaving the land that they have always known. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> is based on a PBS documentary series also named <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> book received many positive reviews.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Baltimore <b>News</b> <b>American</b> Collection {{consists}} of materials that document {{the long history}} of <b>the</b> <b>News</b> <b>American</b> and its predecessors. <b>The</b> <b>News</b> <b>American</b> traced its lineage back to Baltimore's first newspaper, the Maryland Journal and the Baltimore Advertiser, which was started by William Goddard on August 20, 1773. However, historically, the connection between the two newspapers is ambiguous. Instead, the likely origins of <b>the</b> <b>News</b> <b>American</b> date to May 14, 1799, when Alexander Martin launched the American and Daily Advertiser. The collection dates from 1773 - 2006 with the bulk of material dating 1930 - 1973. It includes many different types of materials, such as newspaper clippings, library files, correspondence, scrapbooks, unpublished and published manuscripts and employee newsletters. Prominent individuals documented in the collection include H. L. Mencken, Frank A. Munsey, R. P. Hariss, William Randolph Hearst, Sr., William Randolph, Hearst, Jr. and John Steadman. Additional materials of interest, include information about <b>the</b> <b>News</b> American's Bicentennial Celebration, the demise of <b>the</b> <b>News</b> <b>American,</b> history of <b>the</b> <b>News</b> <b>American</b> buildings and scrapbooks from the 1930 's to the 1940 's including items that contain editorial commentary and the perspectives of William Randolph Hearst, Sr...|$|R

Because of official secrecy, little information about the bomb's development was released by the government, and press reports often attributed the entire weapon's design and development to Teller and his new Livermore Laboratory (when it was actually developed by Los Alamos).|$|E

50|$|As a major Task Force initiative, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> Project, {{seeks to}} {{encourage}} volunteerism among both U.S. citizens and <b>new</b> immigrants. <b>The</b> Task Force accomplished this through, among other projects, a zip code-based search engine listing volunteer opportunities {{to work with}} immigrants {{and a series of}} outreach events to promote volunteerism. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> Project aims to provide opportunities for immigrants themselves to integrate into their communities by volunteering.

40|$|On November 19, 2005, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> Executive Order, a first-in-the-nation {{attempt to}} adopt a coherent, strategic, and {{proactive}} state government approach to integrate the rapidly growing immigrant population of Illinois. For this purpose, the Executive Order created a <b>New</b> <b>Americans</b> Policy Council comprised of 24 prominent Illinois business, faith, labor, community, philanthropic, and governmental leaders with experience in this field. While Illinois has undertaken several efforts to advance immigrant integration, neither it nor any other state has developed a comprehensive and strategic integration policy. Given the rapidly evolving demographics; the fast paced changes of an increasingly global economy; and the growing demand for both high-skilled and low-skilled workers; immigrant integration {{is one of the}} most overlooked issues of governance. The Policy Council's strategic approach emphasizes strategies that allow immigrants to be empowered to participate to the fullest extent possible in our economic and civic life, while fostering social cohesion with their new neighbors.

5|$|With the {{election}} of President Richard M.

The goal of the U.S. was now to buy time for their South Vietnamese allies (and to cover their own withdrawal). On 11 May 1969 Sihanouk welcomed a return to full diplomatic relations with the U.S. On 18 March Nixon, already anticipating this development, ordered {{the bombing of the}} Cambodian sanctuaries by B-52s.|$|E
5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> League West division as a result.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>American</b> Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E

5|$|Gresley's initial Pacific {{project of}} 1915 was for an {{elongated}} {{version of the}} Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders. Finally realising {{that he was in}} a design impasse, he took as a model <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914. This in turn had been updated from a series of prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole, Alco's Chief Consulting Engineer at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania's K29 Alco prototype of 1911, also designed by Cole. Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up-to-date locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The Minnesota Vikings are an American {{football}} team {{playing in the}} National Football League (NFL). The Vikings compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The team was established in 1959, when three Minneapolis businessmen – Bill Boyer, H. P. Skoglund and Max Winter – were awarded a franchise in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> Football League (AFL). In January 1960, the ownership group, along with Bernie Ridder, forfeited its AFL membership and was awarded the NFL's 14th franchise, with play to begin in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Upon Shelby's {{leaving office}} in 1816, President Monroe offered him {{the post of}} Secretary of War, but he {{declined}} because of his age.

He was a faithful member of Danville Presbyterian church, but in 1816, built a small nondenominational church on his property. In 1818, he accompanied Andrew Jackson in negotiating the Jackson Purchase with the Chickasaw. He also served as the first president of the Kentucky Agricultural Society in 1818 and was chairman of the first board of trustees of Centre College in 1819.|$|E

5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of American troops to South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Further playoff defeats followed. In 1968, as a 32-year-old Ryan was benched {{in favor}} of Bill Nelsen, the Browns {{finished}} with a 10–4 record but lost to the Colts in the playoffs. Another playoff loss ended the Browns' season in 1969, this time to the Minnesota Vikings. After the American Football League's merger with the NFL was finalized in early 1970, the Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts moved to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> Football Conference along with the 10 teams of the former AFL. The Browns were slotted in the AFC Central in the 26-team league, alongside the Steelers, the Houston Oilers and the Cincinnati Bengals, a team Paul Brown founded in 1968 in the AFL. Cleveland's first big move under the new league structure was to trade star receiver Paul Warfield in January 1970 to the Miami Dolphins {{for the rights to}} draft Purdue University quarterback Mike Phipps as a replacement for Bill Nelsen, who had a pair of bad knees.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Paine, {{considered}} too moderate {{by the powerful}} Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the guillotine by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, at that time <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>American</b> Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of The Age of Reason, despite his poor health. Part II {{was first published in}} a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.|$|E
