5|$|At the Menominee–Delta county line, M-35 {{passes from}} the Central to the Eastern Time Zone. After passing {{the south side}} of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the Delta County Airport before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, US2/US41 join M-35 at the {{intersection}} of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form <b>the</b> <b>east–west</b> and north–south axes respectively of the Escanaba street numbering grid. From these two streets, <b>the</b> <b>east–west</b> avenues and north–south streets are numbered in a grid in the City of Escanaba. US2/US41 enter Escanaba from the west along Ludington Street, turning north along Lincoln Road, joining M-35. Here, M-35 joins the National Highway System, which is a road system important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as <b>the</b> <b>East–West</b> Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, <b>the</b> <b>east–west</b> highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E

5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in <b>the</b> <b>East-West</b> competition.

Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E
