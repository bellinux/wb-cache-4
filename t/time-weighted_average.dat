We first propose a Poisson distribution based method to determine the weight vector associated with a <b>time-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> (TWA) operator. Furthermore, we use a hybrid weighted aggregation (HWA) operator to fuse all individual decision information into group opinions at different stages, and then utilize the TWA operator to aggregate the derived group opinions at different stages into the complex group ones so as to rank the given alternatives. After that, we further investigate MS-MAGDM problems where all decision information at different stages cannot be given in exact numerical values, but value ranges can be obtained. An approach based on the uncertain <b>time-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> (UTWA) operator and the uncertain hybrid weighted aggregation (UHWA) operator is developed for solving MS-MAGDM problems under interval uncertainty.

Comparisons {{of satellite}} estimates to rain-gauge data are difficult, however, because of the extreme variability of rain {{and the fact that}} satellites view large areas over a short time while rain gauges monitor small areas continuously.

The model parameters were derived from radar observations of rain, but the model appears to capture many of the characteristics of rain-gauge data as well. The model predicts that many months of data from areas containing a few gauges are required to validate satellite estimates over the areas, and that the areas should be of the order of several hundred km in diameter.

The behavior of a hypothetical two gene in vitro transcription-translation reaction network is investigated using the Gillespie exact stochastic algorithm to illustrate some of the factors that influence the analysis and interpretation of these data. Results Specific issues affecting the analysis and interpretation of simulation data are investigated, including: (1) the effect of time interval on data presentation and <b>time-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> of molecule numbers, (2) effect of time averaging interval on reaction rate analysis, (3) effect of number of simulations on precision of model predictions, and (4) implications of stochastic simulations on optimization procedures.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} the interfractional variability in lung tumor trajectory and mean position {{during the course}} of radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat four-dimensional (4 D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans (median, nine scans/patient) routinely acquired {{during the course of}} treatment were analyzed for 56 patients with lung cancer. Tumor motion was assessed by using local rigid registration of a region of interest in the 3 D planning CT to each phase in the 4 D CBCT. Displacements of the mean tumor position relative to the planned position (baseline variations) were obtained by using <b>time-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> of the motion curve. RESULTS: The tumor trajectory shape was found to be stable interfractionally, with mean variability not exceeding 1 mm (1 SD) in each direction for the inhale and exhale phases. Interfractional baseline variations, however, were large, with 1. 6 - (left-right), 3. 9 - (cranial-caudal), and 2. 8 -mm (anterior-posterior) systematic variations (1 SD) and 1. 2 - (left-right), 2. 4 - (cranial-caudal) and 2. 2 -mm (anterior-posterior) random variations.

Task exposures were combined across the workweek using <b>time-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> to estimate job-level exposures. CTS case-criteria were based on symptoms and results of electrophysiological testing. HRs were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. ResultsAfter adjustment for covariates, analyst (HR= 2. 17; 95 % CI 1. 38 to 3. 43) and worker (HR= 2. 08; 95 % CI 1. 31 to 3. 39) estimated peak hand force, forceful repetition rate (HR= 1. 84; 95 % CI 1. 19 to 2. 86) and per cent time spent (eg, duty cycle) in forceful hand exertions (HR= 2. 05; 95 % CI 1. 34 to 3. 15) were associated with increased risk of incident CTS. Associations were not observed between total hand repetition rate, per cent duration of all hand exertions, or wrist posture and incident CTS. ConclusionsIn this prospective multicentre study of production and service workers, measures of exposure to forceful hand exertion were associated with incident CTS after controlling for important covariates. These findings may influence the design of workplace safety programmes for preventing work-related CTS.
