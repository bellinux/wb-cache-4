Predictions of the models are calibrated with test data on two circular columns taken from literature. Overall torque – twist behaviour and average strain in the <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements</b> were parameters for comparison. It is observed that both the models predicted the overall torsional behaviour of the test specimens reasonably well. However, the peak twist and post peak behaviour were better captured by the TS-STM. Average strain in <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements</b> predicted by the TS-STM was also closer to the measured values compared to the FE predictions.

The parameters included in the experimental program were the concrete compressive strength, the lap splice length, the amount of <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement</b> provided within the splice region, and the shape of the <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement</b> around the spliced bars. The experimental results showed that the displacement ductility increased and the mode of failure changed from a splitting bond failure to a flexural failure when the amount of the <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in the splice region increased, and the compressive strength increased up to 100 MPa. The presence of the <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement</b> around the spliced bars had a pronounced effect on increasing the ultimate load, the ultimate deflection, and the displacement ductility. The prediction of maximum steel stresses for spliced bars using the ACI 318 - 05 building code was compared with the experimental results.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on the behavior of 42 solid clay brick masonry columns internally strengthened by fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) fabrics or stainless steel grids placed in horizontal mortar joints. In some cases, every course, and in other cases, alternate courses were reinforced with steel grids, carbon, and basalt FRP fabrics. Monotonic compressive loading tests were carried out under concentric and eccentric loads. Eccentric tests were carried out by loading the specimens on a reduced area with respect to the entire cross section, producing a disturbed region (D-region). A detailed characterization of the constituent materials was made experimentally. The compression tests show the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening techniques to produce increases in strength and the energy required for collapse of brick columns under concentric loads. Under eccentric loads, the reduction in the load-carrying capacity owing to the reduced loaded area is attenuated by the presence of the <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> An analytical expression is proposed that gives the strength of clay brick masonry columns considering that the biaxial strength domain of the bricks is modified because of the tensile contribution provided by the presence of <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Moreover, a strut-and-tie model was utilized to calculate the load-carrying capacity in the D-region and was verified against experimental data, with good agreement...|$|R

The issue of connector ductility becomes especially important when partial shear connection is adopted, as premature failure of the shear connectors would lead to sudden failure of the composite beam.

For full shear connection design, pre-splitting shear capacity of the headed stud can be used for the composite design, while for partial shear connection design, post-splitting shear capacity of the headed stud should be used.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{presents the}} results of six full scale beams tests as part of a research program conducted at McGill University on the effect of steel fibres on the shear capacity of a beam with an aid ratio greater than 2. 5. The test specimens had the following dimensions: 4400 mm long, 300 mm wide and 500 mm long. The beams had 4 - 25 M bottom reinforcing bars and 2 - 20 M top reinforcing bars. Two series were designed with different reinforcing details: the "BA" series contained <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement</b> spaced at 275 mm center to center while the "BB" series had no <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The specimens were cast in three batches of two specimens from each series, with each batch containing concrete with respectively 0 %, 0. 5 % and 1 % fibres content by volume. The beams were simply supported and were tested with two equal point loads located at 500 mm from the centre of the beam. This research project demonstrated a clear improvement of the shear capacity resulting from the use of steel fibres for the beams without <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> For the beams with <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> displacement ductility was highly increased. This suggests that fibres have the potential to reduce the congestion of the reinforcement if fibres are designed to replace partially closely spaced <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Also, it was noted that a redistribution of stresses occurred resulting in the formation of more well-controlled cracks.

30|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements</b> confine the {{compressed}} concrete {{in the core}} region and inhibit the buckling of the longitudinal reinforcing bars. In addition, the reinforcements improve the ductility capacity of the unconfined concrete. This study adopted the model proposed by Mander et al.

An analytical model was proposed for confined intermediate strength concrete from 30  MPa to 40  MPa. The model incorporates all relevant parameters of confinement with a smooth transition from 30  MPa to 40  MPa.

30|$|The {{robustness}} of {{reinforced concrete}} structures is {{highly dependent on}} their capacity to deform in a ductile manner. One {{of the most important}} design considerations for ensuring ductility is the provision of <b>transverse</b> <b>reinforcements</b> (stirrups) in order to postpone shear failure and to prevent buckling in columns. Even though stirrups have been used for decades, several questions, such as obtaining the most efficient geometrical stirrup distribution, is still subject of ongoing research (Ding et al. 2011; Corte and Boel 2013; Breveglieri et al. 2015). Stirrups exert lateral compressive stresses on concrete as it expands in the transversal directions due to loading, which improves the structural members strength and ductility. In several scenarios the ductility of the reinforced concrete members is of utmost importance, such as in progressive collapse (Menchel et al. 2009; Hou and Song 2016; Petrone et al. 2016; Rashidian et al. 2016) and resistance against blast loading (Lim et al. 2016; Codina et al. 2016).|$|R
