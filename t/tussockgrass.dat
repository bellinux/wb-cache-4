Stipa lepida) is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names {{foothill}} needlegrass, foothills nassella, foothill stipa, small-flowered stipa, small-flowered needlegrass, and smallflower <b>tussockgrass.</b> It is native to California in the United States, where it occurs {{as far north as}} Humboldt County, and its range extends into Baja California.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpecies {{richness}} {{and diversity of}} Carabidae (Coleoptera), as well as rates of endemicity, are studied along altitudinal transects in the p치ramo of Ecuadorian Andes, from 3500 to 5000 m. Whereas a global tendency to reduction of species richness is evident from 4200 m upwards, two zones of high diversity and high proportion of endemic species occur at 3800 - 4000 m and at 4200 - 4400 m. Species turnover between grass p치ramo and superp치ramo is signifi cantly higher in drier mountains, especially in the Western Cordillera, than in humid mountains of the Eastern Cordillera. The altitudinal range of Carabid species tends globally to decrease along the vertical gradient, but with important local variations due to microenvironmental factors, especially humidity rate. When compared with recent phytogeographical studies, these results tend to {{support the idea that}} the majority of <b>tussockgrass</b> p치ramo is a secondary anthropogenic ecosystem. On the contrary, it is argued that the xeric landscape of the Chimborazo "arenal" is primordial, based on the presence of a stenotopic and possibly relict species, Pelmatellus andium Bates 1891...|$|E
