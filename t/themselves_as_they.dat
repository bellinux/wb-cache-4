5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for <b>themselves,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E

5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before dawn}} on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla {{surprised}} the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged {{the other three}} while suffering only minor damage <b>themselves.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired {{by one of the}} destroyers in Narvik. Commander Bey's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, so he decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the name}} of the band, or the band's logo, the members do not {{consider}} themselves antitheist. Singer Greg Graffin states that more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor for anything that does not allow for an individual's freedom to think or express <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion. Contrary to popular belief, Greg Graffin does not identify himself as an atheist, but chooses to identify as a naturalist.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{original}} written {{records from}} the Fair Play Men or their Declaration of Independence, although many later accounts exist. The two main theories that have been advanced to explain this are: first that any records were destroyed in the Great Runaway (only one house survived in the whole West Branch valley); or second that they kept no records to avoid incriminating <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were illegal settlers. The riders to Philadelphia {{are supposed to have}} lost their copy of the Declaration of Independence when ambushed or later when jailed.|$|E
25|$|While the Zapotec {{remained}} {{dominant in}} many parts of the Central Valleys and into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mixtec were pushing into Zapotec territory, taking Monte Alban. In areas they conquered, they became prolific builders, leaving behind numerous and still unexplored sites. However, the conquest of the Central Valleys was never completed with pressure coming from the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Zapotecs and Mixtecs both allied themselves and fought among <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> tried to maintain their lands and valuable trade routes between the high central plains of Mexico and Central America.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} {{function of the}} correct lead is for balance. While they are unimportant on a straight line, they can greatly influence the athletic ability of a horse on turns, especially if the turn is tight or performed at speed. Horses naturally lean in to the direction they are turning. Since they extend their lead-side legs further out, they may use them to balance <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lean into that direction. So, if on the right lead while taking a right turn, the right hind will be positioned more under the body, and the right foreleg more {{in front of the}} body, to act as a stabilizer as the horse turns.|$|E
25|$|Avatars {{may take}} any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a {{combination}} thereof) or residents may choose to resemble <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are in real life. They may choose even more abstract forms, given that {{almost every aspect of}} an avatar is fully customizable. Second Life Culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as alts).|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} two decades of the 19th century, London was {{expanding}} outwards as suburbs became more built up and were absorbed into the built-up area of London itself. Towns such as Croydon, Sutton and Norwood, which had previously been commuter towns separate from London, grew to form one large area of housing. Much of this was because {{of the success of the}} 'Terriers' <b>themselves,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had sped up suburban passenger services, encouraging people to move out of the centre of London. Trains became progressively heavier while the need for shorter journey times remained the same. As a result, the engines gradually became largely unsuited for their original purpose, and they were replaced by the larger D class tank engines. However the 'Terriers' were so reliable that they were put on other work, often finding use on branch line passenger and freight workings and as shunting engines.|$|E

The following week, Insane Clown Posse were interviewed in the ring by Mike Tenay. The duo explained that they were fans of TNA, and {{that they wanted to}} be a part of the promotion <b>themselves.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> started making (kayfabe) negative remarks toward Jeff Jarrett, Glenn Gilberti and David Young interrupted. When Gilberti tried to convince the duo to apologize to Jarrett, Insane Clown Posse chased Gilbertti and Young out of the ring before challenging the team to a match for the next week.|$|E
25|$|On January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremoniously broke {{ground in}} Sacramento, California, to begin {{construction}} of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains <b>themselves.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborersâ€”mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.|$|E
