40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental results {{related to the}} shear behaviour of unreinforced and geosynthetic-reinforced rail ballast. Large-scale direct shear tests were performed using fresh Latite ballast and geogrids with different aperture sizes. The laboratory experimental {{results indicate that the}} shear behavior of both unreinforced and geosynthetic-reinforced ballast follow a non-linear trend at low confining stress. The results further suggest that the shear strength of ballast can be improved significantly when reinforced with geosynthetics. However, the shear strength at the ballast-geosynthetic interface is found to be a function of the geogrid aperture to particle size ratio. It is expected that this study will assist in selecting suitable geosynthetics for successfully stabilising a given ballast gradation, to reduce <b>track</b> maintenance <b>costs.</b> Keywords: <b>Rail</b> ballast, Interface behaviour, Direct shear test, Geosynthetics...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO {{developed}} a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the <b>tracks</b> corrodes <b>rails,</b> <b>costing</b> Indian Railways {{tens of millions}} of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane., which can then be harmlessly discharged onto the tracks. Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets by 2020-2021. All new coaches will be installed with bio-toilets from 2016, with older rolling stock to be gradually retrofitted.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an intelligent image processing algorithm capable of detecting fatigue defects from images of the rail surface. The links between the defect detection algorithm and 3 D models for rail crack propagation are investigated, considering the influence of input parameters (materials, vehicle characteristics, loading conditions). The dynamic behaviour at the wheel-rail interface resulting in contact forces responsible for stressing and straining the rail material are imported from vehicle dynamics simulations. The integration of the simulated results from vehicle dynamics, contact and fracture mechanics models offer more reliable estimation of the stress intensity factors (SIF). Also the sensitivity analysis related to materials, vehicle characteristics, and loading conditions will provide further understanding of the factors that influence crack propagation in rails such as shear stresses, hydraulic pressure, fluid entrapment and squeeze film effect. This novel application of image processing for the detection of rail surface rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage and automatic incorporation in a crack growth model represents an important contribution to the development of modern techniques for non-destructive rail inspection. This will result in improved planning/scheduling of future rail maintenance (e. g. rail grinding, renewal), less disruptions and reduced <b>track</b> maintenance <b>costs</b> in <b>rail</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{external}} costs of surface freight transport in Spain and finds that a reduction {{occurred over the}} past 15 years. The analysis yields two conclusions: trucks have experienced a reduction in external <b>costs,</b> and <b>rail</b> has lower externalities. The external costs of road freight transport decrease between 1993 and 2007 (44 %). The external <b>costs</b> of <b>rail</b> freight increase by 12 %.

The external <b>costs</b> of <b>rail</b> related to pollutant emissions and climate increase by 4 % and 43 %. Oppositely, the external costs related to accidents decrease by 27 %. Road freight generates eight times the external <b>costs</b> of <b>rail,</b> 2. 35 Euro cents per tonne kilometre in 2005 (5. 6 % accidents, 74. 7 % air pollution and 19. 7 % climate) vs. 0. 28 (13. 4 % accidents, 53. 9 % air pollution and 32. 7 % climate) ...|$|R

It opens with a theoretical discussion, which concludes that the appropriate basis for changing is long run marginal social cost, but casts some doubt on whether the existing cost allocation procedure achieves this. The main {{reason for this is}} the likelihood that the marginal capital cost per unit of traffic of coping with an increase in traffic volumes greatly exceeds the average capital cost per unit of traffic at the present time. The DTp method of allocating <b>track</b> <b>costs</b> is then outlined, and the sensitivity of the results to variations in a number of the key assumptions is tested. The results show that the DTp method may only be allocating HGVfs as little as half of their costs. Hence instead of covering their allocated costs by some 30...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} of {{life cycle cost}} analysis (LCCA) for high-speed ballastless tracks in Spain is carried out in this document based on an approximation of the present value behaviour through the Electre II Multi criteria method. A review of other LCC researches has been done analysing their results in order to adapt previous experimental <b>tracks</b> <b>costs</b> to the present study which is focused on construction and maintenance costs in Spain. Even though several ballastless systems are introduced and analysed in terms of costs, and environmental impacts; only four of them are deeply compared with ballasted tracks: Japanese Shinkansen, Rheda 2000, EDILON embedded rail system and LVT. The comparisons are established using ratios (ballastless/ballasted <b>track</b> <b>costs)</b> instead of total costs due to their lack of validation among countries and years. Furthermore, two case studies have been presented: one using 3 % as discount rate which favours ballastless choice and another using 6 % which in contrast, favours the traditional option. Last chapter aims to compare results from the presented method with proper present value calculations during 60 years in the Ballasted Madrid-Seville line (Spain) ...|$|R
