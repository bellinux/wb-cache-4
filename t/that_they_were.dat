5|$|In {{the period}} from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and {{opposition}} leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the arbitrary arrest of thousands, and assassinations, {{all of which were}} denied by the authorities. Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being discriminated against by the government, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being treated as second class citizens.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Bellator CEO Bjorn Rebney stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{aiming to}} include Wallhead {{in the third}} season - {{despite the absence of}} a welterweight tournament - with a view to {{including}} him in the fourth season's welterweight tournament.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{scientists}} from Oxford University, the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute conducted tests on ten untrained Tanimbar corellas (Cacatua goffini), and found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to solve complex mechanical puzzles.|$|E

50|$|Carter {{thinks the}} Eagle {{is too low}} and is {{descending}} too rapidly but Kano counters <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing just fine by Computer. Irving reports <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> on course and holding and that everything is fine, but Carter observes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too close and too fast.|$|R
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> even {{more prone to}} wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Interface 2 proved popular, {{the high}} cost of ROM cartridges, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> limited to 16K in size, meant that very few titles were {{released}} in this format.|$|E
5|$|Any {{driver in}} the pit lane when a race is {{suspended}} was permitted {{to return to the}} circuit and take up the position on the grid <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> running in {{at the time of the}} suspension.|$|E
50|$|Another {{source of}} Anti-South Korean {{sentiment}} within China originates from reports {{by a number}} of overseas Chinese students in Korea, who experienced negative attitudes of local Koreans. It <b>is</b> reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> discriminated against based on the stereotype <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> uncivil, poor, and ignored by Koreans. Such reports by students claim <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> discriminated against based on the assumption <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> viewed as uncivil, poor and are excluded or ignored by Koreans.|$|R
60|$|Take as an {{instance}} the commonest of all--a storm. We know that storms are not caused (as folk believed in old time) by evil spirits; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> natural phenomena, obeying certain fixed laws; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> necessary {{from time to}} time; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> probably, on the whole, useful.|$|R

5|$|Blassingame {{asserts that}} slave parents {{attempted}} to shield infants {{and young children}} from the brutality of the plantation.

5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a cult or secret society; or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|R

5|$|Cheryl Cole later {{stated that}} despite her {{initially}} hating the song, {{that the success}} of the single taught the group <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to listen to their label from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> armed as a pike phalanx.

5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> similar to turtles.

5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious.
