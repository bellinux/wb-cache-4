50|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. More <b>textured</b> <b>finishes</b> include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with impact tools varying in coarseness. A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. A thermal (or flamed) <b>finish</b> produces a <b>textured,</b> nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame.

50|$|Dimension stone {{requires}} some specialized methods for cleaning and maintenance. Abrasive cleaners {{should not be}} used on a polished stone finish because it will wear the polish off.

50|$|The five-storey Pacific Commercial Company Building, {{also known}} as the National City Bank, was {{designed}} by American architects Murphy, McGill and Hamlin of New York City and Shanghai, and was completed in 1923 at a cost of two million pesos. Occupying about 1,800 square meters of an irregularly shaped corner lot adjacent to El Hogar, it has a frontage of forty-three meters on General Luna Street and forty-six meters on Muelle de la Industria, along the Pasig River. The building derived its design from the trademark architectural features set by the International Banking Corporation of New York for its overseas branches. The bank’s prototype was made up of a row of colossal columns in antis, which was faithfully reproduced for its Manila headquarters. The ground floor was fully rusticated to effect a <b>textured</b> <b>finish.</b> This floor had arched openings with fanlights emphasized by stones forming the arch. The main doors were adorned with lintels resting on consoles. Above the ground floor were six three-storey high, engaged Ionic columns, ending in an entablature topped by a cornice. These six columns dominating the south and west facades were, in turn, flanked by a pair of pilasters on both fronts. The fifth floor was slightly indented and also topped by an entablature crowned by strip of anthemion.|$|E
40|$|Electric field {{strength}} and leakage current density in the shank region of a polluted polymeric insulator may cause local dry-banding, with {{a risk of}} long-term degradation from partial-arc discharges. In a novel approach to dry-band control, the characteristics of silicone rubber surfaces with a <b>textured</b> <b>finish</b> are investigated and, depending on the geometry chosen for the texture, two useful objectives can be achieved. First, the increase of surface area can both reduce the leakage current density in the vulnerable shank region, and also increase the longitudinal creepage distance. Secondly, the damage arising from surface discharges can be mitigated. The principles of the proposed anti-fog design are described in detail. While complete prototype insulators are now being specified for fabrication, this paper reports preliminary results from tests using rectangular samples, which show an improvement in performance. The tests are of two kinds: a) inclined-plane, to assess erosion and tracking on rectangular samples of insulation materials. Such samples have been prepared both with a conventional plane surface and with a textured surface for comparative tests; b) clean-fog tests that use an initially dry pollution layer of known salinity. Here, plane and textured samples {{have been used for}} comparative tests, where leakage current and discharge activity are monitored during the generation of the fog...|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this project}} to test practice-oriented {{procedures}} that will allow for a broad application of electrostatic coating techniques for wood and wood com-posites. The underlying coating principle "Electric discharge across the wet paint film" has already been tested in the feasibility study for wood composites (Funding No. BW D 20002), and {{has been found to be}} suitable for practical use. For the testing of practice-proof procedures, three examples of application, namely - Finish painting of window frames, - <b>Textured</b> <b>finishing</b> of kitchen fronts, and - High-gloss painting of car interior parts were acquired, reset in the coating lab of Fraunhofer IPA (average value and dis-tribution of film thickness analog to practice examples), and finally the coating process was carried out with electrostatic high-speed rotational bells. In the present studies, considerable improvements compared to the current status of the practice examples could be obtained by using electrostatic high-speed rotational atomization for water-based paints. Both, average value and distribution of film thickness could be reproduced as on the original parts. Chemical and physical resistance of the water-based paints that were used in the electrostatic coating tests, however, differ from the values of the original paints. In the electrostatic application, the soiling tendency has been found to be non-critical, as long as plant dimensions, booth air flow, and atomizer control are operated in an adapted manner. The coating of wood and wood composites by electrostatic high-speed rotational bells offers high saving potentials. For a successful implementation, clearance tests are required for the water-based paints to be used...|$|R
40|$|A study {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} sheet surface condition on resistance spot welding (RSW) of aluminium has been carried out. This concentrates on two automotive aluminium alloys; AA 5754 and AA 6111, used for structural and closure applications respectively. The results show the marked effect that surface condition can have on the RSW process. For AA 5754 sheet incomplete removal of a ‘disrupted surface layer’ prior to surface pretreatment is shown to have a detrimental effect on the RSW process. The solid wax lubricant used to assist metal forming leads to unpredictable changes in contact resistance, and consequently affects the process stability. For AA 6111 closures the final surface topography can influence the RSW process. Standard ‘mill’ and electro-discharge <b>textured</b> (EDT) <b>finish</b> sheet surfaces were examined and preliminary results suggest that both are suitable for welding. The successful application of RSW of aluminium sheet requires careful consideration of the sheet surface condition. This requires close collaboration between material suppliers and automotive manufacturers...|$|R
50|$|Starcom Network {{began its}} life as Radio Distribution (Barbados) Limited, with the {{introduction}} of the first broadcast station then located at Wildey, St. Michael in 1935. At that time, the company transmitted its broadcast signal using a cable network system, known as subscription radio. As the only radio station in Barbados until the first wireless radio station 900 AM was started in 1963, subscribers used to pay for the radio on a monthly bases. The service (basically a large PA system) later renamed Barbados Rediffusion was broadcast via cable to wall-mounted <b>textured</b> wood <b>finished</b> receivers. Each device was connected to wires via telephone poles {{all the way back to}} the studio. The premier presenters were Alfred Pragnell, Olga Lopes-Seale, Maurice Norville and David Ellis. It was broadcast from 4pm to 10pm. The service was later expanded, featuring soap operas of the day. With the passage of time, Barbados Rediffusion closed on 30 November 1997.|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{flashover}} {{constitutes the}} predominant parameter for the design,specification and dimensioning of high voltage outdoor insulation [1 - 2]. For {{over a quarter}} of a century, polymeric insulators have been used for overhead lines and substations due to their enhanced performance in highly polluted environments. This is mainly attributed to the hydrophobic properties of polymeric surfaces thatlead to a reduction of surface wetting and, thus, to a reduction of leakage current and discharge activity that could result to a flashover. However, under severe ambient conditions, discharge activity is not totally eliminated. The present investigations have demonstrated the development of dry bands and partial arcs on polymeric insulators (Chapter 3). While ‘cap and pin’ ceramic insulators - e. g. porcelain and glass - employ special anti-fog designs of increased leakage path introduced by the presence of deeper ribs, such profiles cannot be used for polymeric insulators due to moulding restrictions [1 - 1]. Yet, these moulding properties allow the fine texturing of the polymeric surface [1 - 7]. Textured insulators are a novel approach for the improvement of polymeric insulators using a surface design consisting of an array of hemispherical protuberances of various configurations and range of diameters. The objective is to reduce power dissipation (P = EJ) on the insulator surface by reducing the electric field gradient E and current density J (Chapter 2). Moreover, an increase of the longitudinal creepage path can be achieved without the need of increasing the overall length of the insulator. Where discharges do occur, the formation of parallel current paths could lead to less harmful discharges hence mitigating damage due to thermal stresses. An initial theoretical classification of the textured designs resulted to a shortlist of textured patterns that could be employed {{for the development of a}} full insulator prototype. At the next stage, these patterns were experimentally evaluated in a series of material tests in accordance to IEC- 60587 inclined-plane test procedure [Chapter 5]. Rectangular silicone rubber samples with a plane surface were tested along with samples with a <b>textured</b> <b>finish</b> to assess the performance against erosion and tracking. The improvement introduced by these textured patterns in comparison with conventional non-textured samples was outstanding [2 - 48, 49]. The intersecting square pattern showed the best performance, hence it was chosen for the development of a full textured insulator. Conventional 11 kV silicone rubber insulators and textured insulators with the same shed profile were cast in-house using vacuum injection casting techniques. There are no international standards for the artificial testing of polymeric insulators. In this work, a proposed test procedure for non-ceramic insulators is described (Chapter 3). Clean-fog tests of conventional (Chapter 4) and textured insulators (Chapter 6), for a range of wetting and pollution severity conditions,showed that textured insulators showed an improved flashover performance that in some cases reached 26 %. Surface texturing seems to be more effective under severe conditions of wetting and pollution and when hydrophobicity is reduced, like the temporary loss of hydrophobicity observed for silicone rubber insulators in service...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{concrete}} can {{be treated}} {{using a variety of}} special methods to produce aesthetically pleasing effects. This type of concrete is called architectural concrete. It is possible to produce structures with colourful, smooth or <b>textured</b> surface <b>finishes</b> that will satisfy any of the demands of modern architecture. It is clear that matching the colour and texture of repair work in architectural concrete is problematic. Concrete surfaces with different types of finishes require different rehabilitation processes, just as different ages of concrete require different repair methods. The concrete life cycle is set up for aesthetic repair in this research. Before a repair project is undertaken it is important to ascertain the type of failure. The causes of the failure should be identified and removed if possible. The factors influencing the appearance of the concrete surface should be discussed, in order that the right skills and technical methods are employed during the rehabilitation process. The repair method should be divided into two categories, one is for the young concrete, and another is for the old concrete. A good starting point for the patching mortar of both young and old architectural concrete are suggested {{as a result of the}} experiments. Two new factors have been established as a result of this research, namely the colour coefficient and the colour influence coefficient, both of which will be beneficial to future research projects.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of the BiobeadTM version of the Biological Aerated Flooded Filter Process over the last few years. More than twenty of these units have been installed in the U. K. and the operating experience has enabled further development steps to be made, the range of application to be widened and the design methods associated with the technology to be refined. Operating problems have arisen when the design load is less than that found upon commissioning. For the BAFF system because of the short retention times within the media bed it is essential that excess dissolved oxygen is present at all times. Diurnal peaks in load must be allowed for in design. A related problem is that of septic influent. Septicity has a profound influence on the development flora and fauna in any biological system and so it is preferable that septicity is corrected outside of the BAFF system. Similarly intermittent saline intrusion will reduce performance, although to a lesser extent than that found on Activated Sludge processes. The final problem with BAFF's is that of media quality which is exclusively a quality control problem. The major engineering change introduced to the Biobead system is the aeration system which is now a simple sparge tube immersed in the media. This increases the allowable air rates and is particularly helpful in designing for larger than normal diurnal variation. Similarly, the air scour system now used an array of simple drop tubes. The performance of the media has been further improved by the use of charge neutralising additives to the plastic formulation together with broadening the range of source materials able to produce the <b>textured</b> surface <b>finish.</b> Modules of any size can be produced by assemblies of smaller modules of proven engineering performance...|$|R
