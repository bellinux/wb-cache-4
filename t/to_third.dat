5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move <b>to</b> <b>third,</b> and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance <b>to</b> <b>third.</b> Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went <b>to</b> <b>third,</b> and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
