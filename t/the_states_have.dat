5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> little say in federal decision making.|$|E
5|$|The former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh {{announced}} the operationalisation of the Act. Children, who had either {{dropped out of}} schools or never been to any educational institution, will get elementary education as it will be binding {{on the part of}} the local and State governments to ensure that all children in the 6–14 age group get schooling. As per the Act, private educational institutions should reserve 25 per cent seats for children from the weaker sections of society. The Centre and <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> agreed to share the financial burden in the ratio of 55:45, while the Finance Commission has given Rs.250billion to the States for implementing the Act.

50|$|To Brooks' {{contention}} that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> directly authorized <b>the</b> re-sale of her possessions under the UCC, Rehnquist responded that the UCC merely embodied <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> {{decision not to}} involve itself in the debtor-lendor dispute.

25|$|The Constitution {{is silent}} {{on the issue of}} whether or not Congress may limit the length of time that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> to ratify {{constitutional}} amendments sent for their consideration.

25|$|Municipalities, as <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>have</b> {{autonomous}} administrations, {{collect their}} own taxes {{and receive a}} share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.

25|$|On {{both sides}} of the Canada–United States border, the {{proliferation}} of dams and impoundments have multiplied, necessitating more regulatory efforts. Concerns by the mid-19th century included obstructions in the rivers which prevented salmon and lake sturgeon from reaching their spawning grounds. The Wisconsin Fisheries Commission noted a reduction of roughly 25% in general fish harvests by 1875. <b>The</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> removed dams from rivers where necessary.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of common}} law being {{replaced}} by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most {{but not all of}} <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s and the Federal Rules of Evidence in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the interstitial common law process determines the scope and application of the statute.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to statutory constraints, Congress and <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>have</b> altered {{the electoral process}} through amending the Constitution (first in the above mentioned Fifteenth Amendment). The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that {{they are to be}} elected by the people of the states. Also, the Nineteenth Amendment prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex; the Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax; and the Twenty-sixth Amendment prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of federal operations under the Constitution in 1789 through {{the beginning}} of 2013, approximately 11,539 proposals to amend the Constitution have been introduced in the United States Congress.

Prior to the Twenty-seventh Amendment, which languished for 202 years, 7 months, 12 days before being ratified (submitted for ratification in 1789 as part of the Bill of Rights, but not ratified until 1992), the Twenty-second Amendment held the record for longest time taken to successfully complete the ratification process – 3 years, 11 months, 6 days.

500|$|They act as {{limitations}} on {{the powers of the}} legislature and executive, under Article 13, and in case of any violation of these rights the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> the power to declare such legislative or executive action as unconstitutional and void. These rights are largely enforceable against the State, which as per the wide definition provided in Article 12, includes not only the legislative and executive wings of the federal and state governments, but also local administrative authorities and other agencies and institutions which discharge public functions or are of a governmental character. However, there are certain rights– such as those in Articles 15, 17, 18, 23, 24– that are also available against private individuals. Further, certain Fundamental Rights– including those under Articles 14, 20, 21, 25– apply to persons of any nationality upon Indian soil, while others– such as those under Articles 15, 16, 19, 30– are applicable only to citizens of India.|$|E

500|$|Tyler was unfazed {{when the}} Whig-controlled Senate {{rejected}} his treaty {{by a vote}} of 16–35 in June 1844; he felt that annexation was now within reach by joint resolution rather than by treaty, and made that request to the congress. Former President Andrew Jackson, a staunch supporter of annexation, persuaded Polk to welcome Tyler back into the Democratic party and ordered Democratic editors to cease their attacks on him. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Polk's narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution. Tyler announced in his annual message to Congress that [...] "a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> declared in favor of immediate annexation." [...] In late February 1845, the House approved a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas by a substantial margin—the Senate approved by a bare 27–25 majority, and three days before the end of his term, Tyler signed the bill into law. After some debate, Texas accepted the terms and entered the union on December 29, 1845, as the 28th state.|$|E
