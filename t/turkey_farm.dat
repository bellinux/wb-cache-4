25|$|Now {{known as}} <b>Turkey</b> <b>Farm</b> Road, NY29A {{continues}} southeast through Johnstown, becoming a two-lane residential street into the hamlet of Progress. After Progress, the route becomes more rural, soon crossing {{into the town}} of Mayfield.

25|$|At a {{junction}} {{with the}} western terminus of CR107 (East Main Street), the moniker of NY30A switches to North Comrie Avenue, soon reaching a junction with NY29. At this junction, NY30A begins paralleling Cayadutta Creek, winding northeast through Johnstown. The route bypasses the city of Gloversville, reaching a junction with NY29A (<b>Turkey</b> <b>Farm</b> Road) before crossing into a section of Gloversville. In this small section, NY30A junctions with the terminus of NY349 (East State Street). NY30A and NY349 now parallel each other out of Gloversville, crossing into the town of Mayfield. In Mayfield, NY30A crosses through the hamlet of Riceville, where it meets an intersection with NY30.

Fifteen Mile Creek Road continues south as an unimproved road through Green Ridge State Forest. US40Scenic passes over I-68 and passes by the westbound Exit62 ramps before intersecting the eastern end of MD144 (Old National Pike), which heads west as the local complement to the National Freeway. The scenic route continues as National Pike, crosses Fifteenmile Creek, then makes a sharp curve to the east, intersecting another section of Fifteen Mile Creek Road and beginning the short climb to the top of Green Ridge. After a short descent, the highway begins its curvy ascent of Town Hill, which has no climbing lanes. US 40 Scenic, which passes through the Billmeyer Wildlife Management Area, descends the mountain to the community of Piney Grove, where the highway intersects Orleans Road. At Mann Road, the highway turns south to cross over I-68.

40|$|Hogs {{are often}} grown in close {{proximity}} to <b>turkey</b> <b>farms</b> in North Cartolina, and the potential exists for transfer of pathogens, including Campylobacter, from one host animal to another. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain evidence for possible transfer of Campylobacter coli from hogs to turkeys, or vice versa. Strains from four paired hog and <b>turkey</b> <b>farms</b> were isolated and characterized in terms of their antibiotic resistance profiles, and by molecular subtyping utilizing PCR-RFLP of flaA. Certain strains were found to be shared between hogs and turkeys, suggesting possible transfer. In spite of identical molecular subtypes, such strains commonly differed in antibiotic resistance profiles. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that strains of C. coli may transfer between hogs and turkeys, or that certain strain subtypes may independently colonize these animals through unidentified reservoirs...|$|R
