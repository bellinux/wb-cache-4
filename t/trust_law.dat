In October 2013, Grupo Garza Ponce announced that they were selling 29 industrial parks and 4 territorial reservation areas totaling US$274.8 million to Fibra Uno, a Mexican real estate investment firm. This decision {{was part of a}} partnership agreement they had with US-based real estate firm Clarion Partners. Fibra Uno agreed to inherit a US$74.3 million debt and pay US$200.5 million in trust certificates. Garza Treviño explained that as part of the <b>trust</b> <b>law,</b> Grupo Garza Ponce and Clarion Partners owned half of the assets that were sold, which meant that each part was to receive US$137.4 million for the transaction. Garza Treviño stated that the money would be used to construct two additional industrial parks. Fibra Uno's general director Gonzalo Robina clarified that of the 29 industrial parks acquired, 14 of them were in Nuevo León, 13 were in either Chihuahua and Tamaulipas, one in San Luis Potosí, and another one—valued at US$50 million, the highest of the transaction—was in Saltillo, Coahuila.|$|E
25|$|English <b>trust</b> <b>law</b> {{concerns}} {{the creation and}} protection of asset funds, which are usually held by one party for another's benefit. Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations, but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States. Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courts and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result. On the King's behalf, the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery. Historically, trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will, created family settlements, created charities, or some types of business venture. After the Judicature Act 1873, England's courts of equity and common law were merged, and equitable principles took precedence. Today, trusts {{play an important role}} in financial investments, especially in unit trusts and pension trusts, where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish to save for retirement. Although people are generally free to write trusts in any way they like, an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries, or regulate the trust relationship, including the Trustee Act 1925, Trustee Investments Act 1961, Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, Trustee Act 2000, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{academic}} {{theories of}} <b>trust</b> <b>law,</b> {{there have been}} at least three main strands of discussion that have preoccupied authors in recent years. First, because <b>trust</b> <b>law</b> derived from the Lord Chancellor and courts of equity, separate from the common law (at least notionally) there has been a persistent debate over the extent that common law and equity should be [...] "fused". Before the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 and 1875, influential judges and authors, such as Edward Coke, and William Blackstone, had disapproved the notion that equitable jurisdiction was in some way distinct from the law. In the 19th century, Charles Dickens' books had heaped enough ridicule on the Victorian Chancery judges to impel reform. The court systems were merged, and if there was a conflict the precedents deriving from equity would prevail. But there remained disagreement about whether this was meant to achieve fusion in [...] "substance", rather than merely a fusion of [...] "procedure". The minority view, particularly well represented in Australia, is that equity represents a distinctive set of principles and its own logic, as manifested in the institutions it created, such as the trust. The majority view, however, {{is that there is no}} good reason why, as Andrew Burrows has written [...] "We do this at common law but that in equity" [...] when the situations are functionally identical, to treat like cases alike. If rules in equity, including <b>trust</b> <b>law,</b> did one thing and common law did another, either the common law was wrong or equity was wrong. One of the rules should be changed. Since the House of Lords and the Supreme Court declared it would overrule previous judgments that did not meet the evolving requirements of contemporary justice, the notional primacy of equity over common law was effectively obsolete. Even if a precedent in equity did still prevail over common law, either or both could be overruled in the interests of justice. In practice, the debate about the fusion of law and equity has waned in importance compared to discussion of how to fuse interpretation of judge made law with statutory regulation (for instance in the context of pensions or investment), and how to fuse national law with international norms, in an emergent system of global justice.|$|E
