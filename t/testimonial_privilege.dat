Writing for the majority, Justice Byron White declared that the petitioners were asking the Court [...] "to grant newsmen a <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> that other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do." [...] White acknowledged the argument that refusing to recognize such a privilege would undermine {{the ability of the}} press to gather news, but wrote that [...] "from the beginning of the country the press has operated without constitutional protection for press informants, and the press has flourished." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} redress wrongfully {{disclosed}} confidences through a separate {{breach of confidence}} tort is the topic of this Note. Not all disclosures are actionable wrongs. This Note will deal mainly with extrajudicial disclosures of customarily confidential information and will touch only superficially on <b>testimonial</b> <b>privileges.</b> This Note also will examine the inadequacies of theories advanced by many courts thus far as remedies for wrongful disclosures and the justification {{for the development of}} a separate breach of confidence tort in North Carolina...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{analyzes}} whether legislation {{analogous to}} rape-shield statutes should be enacted to limit testimony concerning the prior sexual {{history of a}} murder victim. The Note discusses {{the historical development of}} rape-shield statutes and the policies underlying their enactment, examines the constitutional of rape-shield statutes, and discusses the rationale behind state court decisions upholding the constitutionality of rape-shield statutes. The Note then considers whether existing law concerning the right of privacy and <b>testimonial</b> <b>privileges</b> may be construed to enable the family members of a murder victim to prevent the exposure of a deceased victim 2 ̆ 7 s sexual past. Based upon this analysis, the Note proposes legislation to extend the protection of rape-shield statutes to deceased victims of sex crimes...|$|R
50|$|The witness-spouse may invoke <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> {{regarding}} {{events which}} occurred (1) during the marriage, if the spouses are still married; and (2) {{prior to the}} marriage if he is married to his spouse in court proceedings {{at the time of}} trial. If, by the time the trial occurs, the spouses are no longer married, the former spouse-witness may testify freely about any events which occurred prior to, after, or even during the marriage. Spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege,</b> in other words, only lasts as long as the marriage does.|$|E

40|$|This Article reviews {{both the}} giving and the taking away: the protections afforded to {{confidentiality}} by privileges and legal duties, {{and the way}} those protections are eroded. The duties of professionals and others to maintain confidences are noted, but <b>testimonial</b> <b>privileges</b> are emphasized. This Article proposes reforms {{in the way we}} try to protect confidentiality and suggests that the protection of therapy confidences be dealt with as a coherent whole (privileges and obligations of confidentiality should be dealt with together). Exceptions to privileges should be reduced and narrowed, and federal law should recognize the desirability of a consistent approach to confidentiality. Perhaps most importantly, the transmission of some confidential information to third parties should carry with it a duty which would require the recipient to maintain confidentiality (2 ̆ 2 extended confidentiality 2 ̆ 2) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} provide an {{overview}} of some of the more common legal, procedural and practical issues, questions, and problems that committees have faced in the course of an investigation. Following a summary of the case law developing the scope and limitations of the power of inquiry, the essential tools of investigative oversight [...] subpoenas, staff interviews and depositions, grants of immunity, and the contempt power [...] are described. Next, some of the special problems of investigating the executive are detailed, with particular emphasis on claims of presidential executive privilege, the problems raised by attempts to access information with respect to open or closed civil or criminal investigative matters, or to obtain information {{that is part of the}} agency deliberative process, and the effect on congressional access of statutory prohibitions on public disclosure. The discussion then focuses on various procedural and legal requirements that accompany the preparation for, and conduct of, an investigative hearing, including matters concerning jurisdiction, particular rules and requirements for the conduct of such proceedings, and the nature, applicability and scope of certain constitutional and common law <b>testimonial</b> <b>privileges</b> that may be claimed by witnesses. The case law and practice respecting the rights of minority party members during the investigative process is also reviewed. The report concludes with a description of the roles played by the offices of House General Counsel and Senate Legal Counsel in such investigations...|$|R
5000|$|Under U.S. federal common law, the spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> {{is held by}} the witness-spouse, not the party-spouse, and {{therefore}} does not prevent a spouse who wishes to testify from doing so. [...] The rationale of this rule {{is that if a}} witness-spouse desires to testify against the party-spouse, there is no marital harmony left to protect through the obstruction of such testimony. This common law principle is the view in a minority of U.S. states. A majority of U.S. jurisdictions, however, do not follow U.S. federal common law; in most states, the party-spouse, and not the witness-spouse, is the holder of spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> may not {{be invoked}} if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; {{if one of the}} spouses has {{initiated}} a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{communications}} privilege {{begins on}} marriage, and cannot be invoked to protect confidential communications between now-married spouses that occurred {{prior to their}} marriage. [...] Unlike <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege,</b> the communications privilege survives {{the end of a}} marriage, and may be asserted by a spouse to protect confidential communications that were made during the marriage—even after divorce or death.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{also had}} no trouble {{applying}} it to therapy provided by a licensed clinical social worker. Social workers provide {{a significant amount of}} mental health treatment. Their clients often are of modest means and cannot afford the assistance of psychiatrists and psychologists. The vast majority of states explicitly extend a <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> to social workers. Thus, the Court saw no reason to delimit the privilege so as to exclude social workers from the privilege.|$|E
50|$|Police {{and public}} safety {{psychology}} requires, at a minimum, distinctive {{knowledge of the}} following: essential functions of police and public safety organizations and personnel, working conditions unique to their respective positions, common and unusual stressors in public safety work, normal and abnormal adaptation to occupational stress and trauma, research related to resilience and recovery in public safety personnel, and the unique aspects of confidentiality and <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> when providing services to public safety personnel and/or agencies.|$|E
50|$|Both {{types of}} {{privilege}} {{are based on}} the policy of encouraging spousal harmony and preventing spouses from having to condemn, or be condemned by, their spouses: the spousal communications privilege or confidences privilege is a form of privileged communication that protects the contents of confidential communications between spouses during their marriage from testimonial disclosure, while spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> (also called spousal incompetency and spousal immunity) protects the individual holding the privilege from being called to testify in proceedings relating to his/her spouse.|$|E

50|$|The spousal {{communications}} privilege may not {{be invoked}} if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; {{if one of the}} spouses has initiated a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses. These three scenarios are identical to the limitations which also apply to limit the spousal <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b> Two further scenarios apply to defeat the attachment of the spousal communications privilege: if the confidential communication was made in order to plan or commit crime or fraud, or if a defendant-spouse wishes, in a criminal trial, to testify in their own defense, about a confidential marital communication. In these five cases, a court will not allow either spouse to assert the privilege to block the testimony.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{what happens}} to <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> following a patient's death. First, the article reviews the concepts of confidentiality and <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b> Second, the article discusses the case of Jaffe v. Redmond, in which the Supreme Court ruled that <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> applies to licensed psychothera-pists under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Third, the article examines the case of Swidler & Berlin v. United States, in which the Supreme Court directly addressed {{the question of whether}} <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> survives death. Finally, the article comments on the implications of these rulings for mental health pro-fessionals. What happens when a subpoena arrives for the records of a patient who has died'? Does death attenuate or dissolve the bonds of confidentiality? The case of Vincent Foster raised this question. While at issue were the records of Foster's at-torney, the Supreme Court's reasoning and final decision have enormous impli-cations for mental health professionals. In January of 1993, following the 199...|$|E

40|$|Article {{published}} in law review. Part I of this Article reviews the Jaffee decision. ' Part II discusses {{the meaning of}} the Supreme Court's opinion, focusing on the Court's analysis of the important interests at stake in recognizing the asserted <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b> In Part II, this Article argues that the Court followed the intent of Congress in crafting a psychotherapist- patient privilege. Furthermore, the extension of the privilege to cover confidential communications made to social workers indicates that there is room for further development of the privilege. In Part III, the Article argues that Jaffee provides the foundation for recognition of a counselor-battered woman privilege in federal court...|$|E
40|$|Professor Levinson distinguishes two {{difficulties}} in the law of <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b> The first is that of identifying the core of concerns that the law of privilege is intended to address. The second is that of explaining how {{the structure of the}} positive law 2 ̆ 2 fits 2 ̆ 2 these core concerns. Analysis of the first difficulty shows that privilege law imputes to intimacy a value that is not reducible to the individualistic concerns that underlie the privilege against self-incrimination. Discussion of the second difficulty reveals that the law evasively and unthinkingly has compromised the value it would-and ought to-accord to intimate relationships...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the author explores how {{domestic}} violence prevention {{efforts have been}} adversely impacted by the Supreme Court’s new “testimonial” approach to the confrontation clause. Examining the Court’s trilogy of cases from Crawford to Davis and Hammon, the author argues that the introduction of certain forms of hearsay in criminal cases has been drastically limited by the court’s new originalist approach to the Sixth Amendment. The author explains how state spousal privilege statutes often present a significant barrier to obtaining live testimony from victims of domestic violence. The author then argues that state legislatures should reconsider their spousal privilege rules in light of Crawford —many of which are poorly conceived, confused, and outdated—and should reform these statutes to add a spousal crimes exception to both the adverse <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> and the confidential communication privilege...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{states have}} enacted Tarasoff {{statutes}} applicable to psychiatrists. Since {{the first such}} statute was enacted in California in 1985, {{a significant number of}} courts in states with this and similar statutes have reviewed Tarasoff-type claims. This article reviews courts ’ analyses in 76 such cases. There were five basic categories identified, including cases that (1) did not reference the statute; (2) referenced the statute, but did not analyze it; (3) referenced the statute, analyzed it, and found it created a duty; (4) referenced the statute, analyzed it, but found it did not create a duty; and (5) referenced the statute in the context of <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege.</b> Review of these cases revealed that even in states that have Tarasoff statutes, clinicians must continue to rely on their clinical and ethical judgment, rather than statutory guidance, when considering potential protective disclosures or future drafts of protective disclosure statutes...|$|E
40|$|In Jaffee v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996), the U. S. Supreme Court {{recognized}} a <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> protecting the patient-psychotherapist relationship. Its decision {{is based on}} Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which permits courts to decide novel questions of privilege {{in the light of}} reason and experience. The Court held that this rule authorized not only recognition of a new privilege, but also a privilege of a broad scope, extending to relationships between patients and licensed clinical social workers. Its decision came as a mild surprise, given a widely shared assumption that Rule 501 creates a strong presumption against establishment of new privileges. T his article criticizes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on an instrumental rationale, one that sees privileges as a means to the end of encourging individuals to seek needed psychotherapeutic assistance. After examining the etymology of the statutory terms reason and experience, the article argues that the Court should have explored a humanistic, privacy-focused rationale for its decision. Still, the article concludes, the Court arrived at the correct result, and in so doing, offered important insight into the meaning of those key statutory terms...|$|E
40|$|In the 1972 case of Branzburg v. Hayes, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the First Amendment does not protect journalists who refuse to reveal their {{confidential}} sources or news gathering product {{in response to a}} federal grand jury subpoena. That decision has remained vital for 35 years and has reverberated through a number of recent high-profile cases. Despite some form of protection in nearly every state court, reporters haled before a federal judge may have no recourse save prison. Devastating as Branzburg has been for the so-called journalist 2 ̆ 7 s privilege, its negative impact has been far broader. Branzburg is one of Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s earliest news gathering decisions and arguably the most influential. While the press has been very successful in persuading the courts to find First Amendment protection for its editorial product, it has been far less successful with regard to protection for news gathering. The Branzburg precedent epitomizes the frustration of the press in attempting to secure First Amendment, or even statutory, protection for news gathering, and this article explores one of the primary reasons for that failure: the inability of the diverse elements that comprise the press to agree on the appropriate scope of such protection. In particular, the article tells the little-known story of the dispute between the New York Times and its reporter, Earl Caldwell, whose pursuit of a <b>testimonial</b> <b>privilege</b> ultimately led to the Branzburg decision...|$|E
