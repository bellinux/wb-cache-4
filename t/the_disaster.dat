The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds.

From November to January <b>the</b> <b>Disasters</b> challenged for <b>the</b> tag team titles on the house show circuit but usually without a decisive outcome.

5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food {{would normally be}} able to be delivered, were washed out. To deal with the large number of bodies in the wake of <b>the</b> <b>disaster,</b> Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>disaster.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gibson {{had been}} one of 28 people aboard the first {{lifeboat}} to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship. On returning to New York City, she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself.

To add to the film's authenticity, Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night of <b>the</b> <b>disaster.</b> The filming took place in a New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of <b>the</b> <b>disaster</b> was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E

In the theoretical model, the impact of technical capabilities, such as information technology infrastructure, hospital support systems, medical and communication infrastructure, and managerial capabilities on hospital disaster performance has been examined.
