40|$|ABSTRACT: Process {{industry}} involves large plants; mainly {{operating in}} continuous form, to achieve economic mass production output. However {{in some situations}} process vessels and tanks are used, where batch processes, take place. These tanks often contain reactants and products in the liquid state. After treatment or processing, valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the valve closing element and the <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessel,</b> especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel. Moreover, no matter how accurately this amount is estimated to be isolated from the processed amount leaving the vessel, it will still contaminate with the processed product. From hygiene point of view, this may not be accepted. In this work a valve design is introduced; where no fluid is trapped between a process tank and the valve closing element. When the valve is opened the fluid flows to the outlet flow line without any contamination with unprocessed fluid. Thus a contamination free valve design is utilised to achieve hygiene design <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> used in batch based processes. Thus cheap equipment acquiring the hygiene requirements necessary for food and some other products that only can be achieved using expensive mass production lines is obtained...|$|R

40|$|Two deaths {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of exposure to I, I, I-trichloroethane in factories in Surrey within a period of 18. months. Both workers were in their mid-teens and had started their first jobs only a few weeks previously. One death can be attributed to sniffing. In the second case, the worker is thought to have been washing his hands in the few inches of cold solvent at the base of an open tank used for metal degreasing. The operator was found slumped {{over the side of the}} tank and could not be revived when eventually dis-covered. The concentration of solvent in the general atmos-phere of the workroom was well below the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 350 parts per million (ppm). The concen-tration immediately below the rim of the tank was 6000 ppm when the tank was not in use, and rose to over 70 000 ppm when the liquid solvent was disturbed. The reputation which 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane has achieved for low chronic toxicity at or below the TLV does not justify a belief in total absence of risk in its use. The solvent is readily volatile even at room temperature, and the vapour is heavier than air. Therefore, concentrations sufficient to rapidly induce general anaesthesia can be present locally above cold liquid solvent in open <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> in workrooms where the concentration in the general atmosphere is well below the TLV...|$|R

This description includes waste characteristics, waste types, locations, and associated hazards. The goal to be met by the Transition Phase preclosure activities is to place the TSD unit into a safe and environmentally secure condition for the long-term Surveillance and Maintenance (S&M) Phase of the facility decommissioning process. This preclosure work plan has been prepared in accordance with Section 8. 0 of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) (Ecology et al. 1996). The preclosure work plan is one of three critical Transition Phase documents, the other two being: B Plant End Points Document (WHC-SD-WM-TPP- 054) and B Plant S&M plan. These documents are prepared by the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and its contractors with the involvement of Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology). The tanks and vessels addressed by this preclosure work plan are limited to those tanks end vessels included on the B Plant Complex Part A, Form 3, Permit Application (DOE/RL- 88 - 21). The criteria for determining which <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> are in the Part A, Form 3, are discussed in the following.

However {{to be able}} to design with these materials, the mechanical behavior of the materials must be understood with regards to processing, performance, damage tolerance, and environment.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} consume of LNG {{all over the}} world, transport of LNG through sea {{becomes more and more}} important. When LNG carrier is on wave with partly filled tank, sloshing will occur and cause damage to the structure of <b>tank,</b> <b>or</b> affects <b>vessel's</b> ability. Sloshing load nowadays has become a important design parameters as the fatigue consideration. To study this sloshing phenomenon, this thesis carried out a numerical method to simulated the sloshing in partly filled LNG tank with different kinds of shapes, which are prismatic, rectangular and cylindrical tanks. The software STAR-CCM+ is used to model and simulated the sloshing motion, both two dimensional and three dimensional models are involved. Four kinds of tank motions are considered: surge, sway, roll and pitch motion. The tank is excited by a regular sin or cosine waves with natural frequency. Natural frequency of specific tanks is calculated and confirmed. Different kinds of liquid filling levels 30 %, 50 % and 70 % are included. Moreover, the numerical results of the free surface movements are compared with the published experimental results and a good agreement is obtained. In addition, three dimensional effects is found and discussed. Furthermore, some inner structure [...] baffle is used to reduce the sloshing motion and compared...|$|R
40|$|PulCheR (Pulsed Chemical Rocket with Green High Performance Propellants) {{is a new}} {{propulsion}} {{concept in}} which the propellants are fed in the combustion chamber at low pressure and the thrust is generated by means of high frequency pulses, reproducing the defence mechanism of a notable insect: the bombardier beetle. The radical innovation introduced by PulCheR is the elimination of any external pressurizing system even if the thruster works at high pressure inside the combustion chamber. At each pulse, pressurization of the combustion chamber gases takes place due to the decomposition or combustion reaction, and the final pressure {{is much higher than}} the one at which the propellants are stored. The weight of the feeding system is significantly reduced because the propellants are fed at low pressure, and {{there is no need for}} turbopumps, high pressure propellant <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> gas <b>vessels.</b> The feed pressure becomes independent on the chamber pressure and the performance degradation typical of the blow down mode in monopropellant thrusters can be avoided. The PulCheR concept is able to substitute many currently used propulsion systems for accessing space in both mono and bipropellant configurations. The preliminary assessment of this new propulsion concept has been investigated using green propellants with potential similar performance to the current state-of-the-art for monopropellant and bipropellant thrusters...|$|R

Leak detection in <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> applications is almost always a concern for gas or fluid containment in vehicles and in many other industries. Numerous techniques exist for the {{detection of}} leaks in these and other types of structures. When testing is required in a production environment, often the speed of leak detection is very important if all samples must be tested. The use of several ultrasound based methods for leak detection in vehicle cabins and pressure vessel applications is presented here. Ultrasound waves are typically classified as having spectral content greater than 20 kHz. In the case of leak detection in a production environment, frequently the ultrasonic spectrum is largely free from background noise content that dominates the audible spectrum. The method for the response measurement of ultrasonic signals presented here is with the implementation of high frequency microphones. The excitation methods presented here are an active method utilizing an ultrasonic emitter, a passive method relying on the passing of air through leak locations, and a vibro-acoustic method utilizing a small electro-dynamic shaker. The methods presented here have been tested for the existence of leaks in some structures, but have not been tested in this paper for the existence flaws and defects that may potentially lead to leaks in some structures after prolonged use...|$|R

Methods: Fifty-four eyes of 54 patients with different grades of ERM were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified into three groups by ERM grade according to retinal striae and vessel distortion: grade/group 1, visible membranes without retinal striae <b>or</b> <b>vessel</b> distortion; grade/group <b>2,</b> mild to moderate macular striae <b>or</b> <b>vessel</b> straightening; and grade/group 3, moderate to severe striae and vascular straightening. Correlations of BCVA with age, central retinal thickness, ERM grade, and IS/OS disruption as well as of IS/OS disruption, central macular thickness, and BCVA with ERM grade were evaluated. Results: Twenty-nine (53. 7 %) eyes exhibited IS/OS junction disruption. Groups 1 and 2 differed significantly with respect to BCVA (p= 0. 038), but groups 2 and 3 did not (p= 0. 070). Central macular thickness was significantly greater in group 2 than in group 1 (p= 0. 031) and in group 3 than in group 2 (p= 0. 033).

40|$|The {{significant}} rise {{in demand}} for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the economic aspects of its transportation have resulted {{in an increase in}} the number and size of LNG carriers. One of the principal design issues for LNG carriers is sloshing as the containment systems have no internal structures to damp out the liquid motion. Furthermore, because the mass of ship and cargo are comparable, the coupling effect between ship motions and LNG sloshing requires carefu investigation. Considerable increases in the capacity of LNG carriers have renewed interest in the assessment of sloshing loads, and analysis of floating liquefaction and re-gasification installations (floating LNG) requires the inclusion of the sloshing dynamics in a seakeeping model. Recent incidents of sloshing damage onboard LNG carriers 1 have added further urgency to the improvement of sloshing analysis in LNG carriers and floating LNG design. The costs of repair of sloshing damage to the containment system and consequent loss of revenue can be significant. Design optimisation or the use of a numerical wave tank to gather statistical sloshing data requires sloshing simulations with long durations. The full assessment of loading times for offshore LNG (approximately 12 – 18 hours per condition) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is not feasible with currently available computational resources and methods. Membrane containment systems are considered to be at greater risk from sloshing damage than spherical tanks, and detailed sloshing studies are required to determine the sloshing characteristics of a new <b>tank</b> design <b>or</b> <b>vessel</b> operating profile. Model testing at the experimental scale is often used for the comparative assessment of sloshing, but the scaling of impact pressures between model and full scale is often problematic. Full-field numerical techniques such as CFD can capture strongly non-linear sloshing at full scale, but large computational requirements restrict their application and they are unsuitable for the analysis of longer time series due to excessive computational requirements and their susceptibility to growth of numerical errors. Analytical approaches such as multimodal analysis can be computed in faster than realtime, but they are limited to linear and some cases of weakly non-linear sloshing...|$|R
