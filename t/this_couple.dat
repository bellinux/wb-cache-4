500|$|His sexual {{relationship}} with his surrogate mother, Cordelia, particularly evoked attention. Most responses to <b>this</b> <b>couple</b> were negative.

In her academic essay [...] "The Assassination of Cordelia Chase," [...] Jennifer Crusie complained that this plot line led {{to the destruction of}} Cordelia's character. Charisma Carpenter herself, despite previously noted to have fun portraying the role, became critical of the storyline over time, declaring her character’s seduction of a teenage boy creepy. Yet, a few gave a positive response. Liz Gasto of Moviefreak.com included the Angel–Cordelia–Connor triangle in the plus points of fourth season. Underland.com praised the plot line as a [...] "very King Arthur like tale of love and betrayal." [...] Another group was neutral towards the development. In his book , Jes Battis simply observed that the relationship completes the already present “circuit of erotic incest within Buffy and Angel.” Jean Lorrah, in her academic essay [...] "A World Without Love: The Failure of Family in Angel," [...] agreed with previous statements, further noting that Connor {{is the product of a}} relationship with incestuous tones: ”Angel is seduced by Darla, formerly his sire (mother), now his granddaughter [...] Connor’s life, unbeknownst to either parent, has begun.” ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for <b>this</b> <b>couple,</b> but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for <b>this</b> <b>couple,</b> but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the influence of apparatus inertia effects in controlled stress rheometry. As evidenced on creep experiments, the coexistence of apparatus inertia and viscoelasticity leads to a coupling frequency. For weak gels, <b>this</b> <b>coupling</b> frequency is typically between 1 and 100 Hz. Therefore, frequency sweeps around and above <b>this</b> <b>coupling</b> frequency also corresponds to an effective shear stress sweep evolution due to a non-trivial resonant effect. In other words, frequency sweep experiments are not made at constant shear stress. The detailed modelling and analysis of this inertia effect on a typical weak gel shows a clear and fundamental limitation for its characterization using a controlled stress rheometer. Also, alternative approaches to standard rheometer software analysis are proposed to take <b>this</b> <b>coupling</b> effect into account...|$|R

Meanwhile, Amanda, through lack of confidence, dresses in clothes that hide her figure. Amanda's stretch marks also contribute to her lack of self-esteem.

2500|$|The {{tidal force}} on Earth {{due to a}} perturbing body (Sun, Moon or planet) is {{expressed}} by Newton's law of universal gravitation, whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body {{on the side of}} Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth ( [...] which provides the centripetal force causing the orbital motion [...] ) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force towards that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the equatorial bulge outside of a mean spherical radius. <b>This</b> <b>couple</b> can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth's equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth's rotational axis, both toward the ecliptic plane.

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} records of a Filipino settling in the San Francisco Bay Area occurred in the mid-19th Century, when a Filipino immigrant and his Miwok wife settled in Lairds Landing on Marin County coast; many Coast Miwok can trace their lineage to <b>this</b> <b>couple.</b> Significant migration {{began in the early}} 20th Century, including upper-class mestizo businessmen, mariners, and students (known as pensionados). Another group of Filipinos who immigrated to the Bay Area was war brides, many of whom married African-American [...] "buffalo soldiers". Additionally, other immigrants came through the U.S. Military, some through the Presidio of San Francisco, and others as migrant workers on their way to points inland; many of these Filipinos would permanently settle down in the Bay Area, establishing [...] "Manilatown" [...] on Kearny Street (next to Chinatown). At its largest size, [...] "Manilatown" [...] was home to at least ten-thousand Filipinos, the last of whom were evicted in August 1977 from the International Hotel. After 1965, Filipinos from the Philippines began to immigrate to San Francisco, concentrating in the South of Market. In 1970, the San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area had the largest population of Filipinos of any metropolitan area in the continental United States at the time (44,326). Two other nearby metropolitan areas also had a population of Filipinos greater than five thousand in 1970, San Jose (6,768), and Salinas-Monterey (6,147). Due to a change in the ethnic make up of the Yerba Buena neighborhood, and with the construction of the Dimasalang House in 1979, four streets names were changed to honor notable Filipinos. By 1990, thirty percent of the population in South of Market was Filipino American.|$|E
