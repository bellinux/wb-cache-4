Antennas specifically designed to work on both bands are common. Also, 2 meters is far enough away from 70 centimeters to make diplexers small and simple, making it easy <b>to</b> <b>cross-band</b> repeat signals between the two bands with a single dual-band radio.|$|E
40|$|The {{black body}} {{nature of the}} first {{acoustic}} peak of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) was tested using foreground reduced WMAP 5 data, by producing subtraction maps between pairs of cosmological bands, viz. the Q, V, and W bands, for masked sky areas that avoid the Galactic disk. The resulting maps revealed a non black body signal that has two main properties. (a) It fluctuates on the degree scale preferentially in one half of the sky, producing an extra random noise there of amplitude ≈ 3. 5 µK, which is � 10 σ above the pixel noise even after beam size differences between bands are taken into account. (b) The signal exhibits large scale asymmetry {{in the form of a}} dipole (≈ 3 µK) in the Q-V and Q-W maps; and (c) a quadrupole (≈ 1. 5 µK) in the Q-V, Q-W, and V-W maps. While (b) is due most probably <b>to</b> <b>cross-band</b> calibration residuals of the CMB COBE dipole, the amplitude of (c) is well beyond systematics of the kind, and in any case no a priori quadrupole in the CMB exists to leave behind such a residual. The axes of symmetry of (a), (b), and (c) are tilted in the same general direction w. r. t. the axes of the Galaxy. This tilt prevents the immediate ‘trivialization ’ of (a) and (c) in terms of known effects or anomalies, including and especially those of the foreground. In particular, should future attempts in demonstrating the non-cosmological origin of (a) continue to prove difficult, it would mean that degree scale departures from the acoustic model of perturbations is occurring on the last scattering surface at the 4 – 5 % level, and moreover the behavior varies significantly from one half of the universe to another...|$|E

40|$|This study {{represents}} {{a systematic analysis}} {{of the distribution of}} collagen types in human atherosclerotic lesions. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded aortic tissues of 40 lesions from 16 different individuals ranging in age from 1 month to 84 years were examined immunohistochemically using antibodies to type I, III, IV, V, and VI collagens. Preembedding immunoelectron microscopy was used to simultaneously localize type V and VI collagens within the lesions. Localization of type HI collagen was very similar to that of type L and type VI collagen appeared together with these two types of collagen in the thickened intlmas of all stages of the lesion. Type V collagen was not detected in either fatty streaks or the mild Intimal thickening of the aortas of children. With advancing age and lesion progression, the immunoreactivity with anti-type V collagen antibody became more intense. Type IV collagen was detected in the basement membrane region of intimal cells. In advanced lesions thick deposits of type IV collagen were found around the elongated smooth muscle cells. Using immunoelectron microscopy, type V collagen was found to be localized <b>to</b> <b>cross-banded</b> collagen fibers, and type VI collagen was found to be localized to beaded filaments present throughout the interstitium of the thickened intima. These findings suggest that collagens preserve the pathophysiological and functional integrity of the vascular wall by providing mechanical support as well as assuring the proper interaction of cells during the formation o...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} cross-band interference when devices from the same or different networks share radio spectrum. Cross-band interference occurs when unsynchronized transmissions create harmful interference among each other although they use non-overlapping frequency bands. We perform an in-depth study to analytically quantify the degree of interference {{and its impact on}} OFDMA-based packet transmissions. The analysis also takes into account practical artifacts including temporal sampling mismatch, frequency offset and power heterogeneity. Using insights from the analysis, we build and compare three methods that apply temporal and frequency redundancy to reduce the interference and add robustness against it. Experimental and analytical results show that adding frequency guardband is the most efficient solution <b>to</b> tackle <b>cross-band</b> interference. Categories andSubject Descriptor...|$|R

Although some {{feel that}} this {{poses a threat to}} LPFM stations, the FCC did not authorize the use of any new FM translators for this purpose and limited <b>cross-band</b> translation <b>to</b> existing translators that had already been authorized as of May 2009. Since no new translators were authorized, there is no increased threat <b>to</b> LPFMs from <b>cross-band</b> translation services. The FCC also allows translation of HD Radio digital-only channels as inputs for analog FM-only output.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} been made with the {{electron}} microscope {{on the structure of}} chromosomes (7, 9, 8, 1, 5). The results have generally been disappointing in that they have failed to confirm the presence of structural components reported earlier by workers using the light microscope and they have failed to reveal the ordered internal structure expected from the indirect evidence of cytogenetics. In electron micrographs of ultrathin sections, the giant chromosomes of Diptera show variations in density along their length that correspond <b>to</b> the <b>cross-banding</b> visible with the light microscope (1), but in general, the chromosomes of dividing somatic cells in most animal species are surprisingly homogeneous. They lack a limiting membrane and seem to be composed of closely aggregated fine granules of uniform size and moderate density. Ordinarily no chromonemata or other oriented, filamentous subunits are visible. In dividing germ cells of crayfish and grasshopper, however, Moses (6) has recently observed in the chromosomes a central core having a characteristic fine structure. The observations presente...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years we have {{witnessed}} the paradigm shift from static spectrum allocation to dynamic spectrum access/sharing. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a promising mechanism to implement the agile spectrum access. However, in wireless distributed networks where tight synchronization is infeasible, OFDMA faces the problem of cross-band interference. Subcarriers used by different users are no longer orthogonal, and transmissions operating on non-overlapping subcarriers can interfere with each other. In this paper, we explore the cause of cross-band interference and analytically quantify its strength and impact on packet transmissions. Our analysis captures three key practical artifacts: inter-link frequency offset, temporal sampling mismatch and power heterogeneity. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to systematically analyze the cause and impact of cross-band interference. Using insights from our analysis, we then build and compared three mitigating methods <b>to</b> combat <b>cross-band</b> interference. Analytical and simulation results show that placing frequency guardband at link boundaries is the most effective solution in distributed spectrum sharing, while the other two frequency-domain methods are sensitive to either temporal sampling mismatch or inter-link frequency offset. We find that the proper guardband size depends heavily on power heterogeneity. Consequently, protocol designs for dynamic spectrum access should carefully take into account the cross-band interference when configuring spectrum usage...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A procedure was developed <b>to</b> extract <b>cross-band</b> textural features from ERTS MSS imagery. Evolving {{from a single}} image texture extraction procedure which uses spatial dependence matrices to measure relative co-occurrence of nearest neighbor grey tones, the cross-band texture procedure uses the distribution of neighboring grey tone N-tuple differences to measure the spatial interrelationships, or co-occurrences, of the grey tone N-tuples present in a texture pattern. In both procedures, texture is characterized {{in such a way}} as to be invariant under linear grey tone transformations. However, the cross-band procedure complements the single image procedure by extracting texture information and spectral information contained in ERTS multi-images. Classification experiments show that when used alone, without spectral processing, the cross-band texture procedure extracts more information than the single image texture analysis. Results show an improvement in average correct classification from 86. 2 % to 88. 8 % for ERTS image no. 1021 - 16333 with the cross-band texture procedure. However, when used together with spectral features, the single image texture plus spectral features perform better than the cross-band texture plus spectral features, with an average correct classification of 93. 8 % and 91. 6 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} to carry out semi-empirical validation of a new measurement approach we propose for molecular mixing ratios determination. The approach is based on relative measurements in bands of O 2 and other molecules and as such may be best described as cross band relative absorption (CoBRA).. The current validation studies rely upon well verified and established theoretical and experimental databases, satellite data assimilations and modeling codes such as HITRAN, line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM), and the modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA). The approach holds promise for atmospheric mixing ratio measurements of CO 2 {{and a variety of}} other molecules currently under investigation for several future satellite lidar missions. One of the advantages of the method is a significant reduction of the temperature sensitivity uncertainties which is illustrated with application to the ASCENDS mission for the measurement of CO 2 mixing ratios (XCO 2). Additional advantages of the method include the possibility <b>to</b> closely match <b>cross-band</b> weighting function combinations which is harder to achieve using conventional differential absorption techniques and the potential for additional corrections for water vapor and other interferences without using the data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models...|$|R
40|$|Background - Although {{articular}} cartilage {{is the primary}} tissues affected by osteoarthritis (OA), the underlying subchondral bone also undergoes noticeable changes. Despite the {{growing body of research}} into the biophysical and mechanical properties of OA bone there are few studies that have analysed the structure of the subchondral sclerosis at the nanoscale. In this study, the composition and nano-structural changes of human osteoarthritis (OA) subchondral bone were investigated to better understand the site-specific changes. Methods - OA bone samples were collected from patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery and graded according to disease severity (grade I: mild OA; grade IV: severe OA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Electron Diffraction, and Elemental Analysis techniques were used <b>to</b> explore the <b>cross-banding</b> pattern, nature of mineral phase and orientation of the crystal lattice. Subchondral bone nano-hydroxyapatite powders were prepared and characterised using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Subchondal bone mechanical properties were investigated using a nano-indentation method. Results - In grade I subchondral bone samples, a regular periodic fibril banding pattern was observed and the c-axis orientation of the apatite crystals was parallel to the long axis of the fibrils. By contrast, in grade IV OA bone samples, the bulk of fibrils formed a random and undulated arrangement accompanied by a circular oriented pattern of apatite crystals. Fibrils in grade IV bone showed non-hierarchical intra-fibrillar mineralization and higher calcium (Ca) to phosphorous (P) (Ca/P) ratios. Grade IV OA bone showed higher crystallinity of the mineral content, increased modulus and hardness compared with grade I OA bone. Conclusions - The findings from this study suggest that OA subchondral sclerotic bone has an altered mineralization process which results in nano-structural changes of apatite crystals that is likely to account for the compromised mechanical properties of OA subchondral bones...|$|R
