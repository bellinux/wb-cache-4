5000|$|By 1918, Pearl Eaton {{had become}} a dancer and {{assistant}} to the director with <b>the</b> Ziegfeld <b>Follies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Follies</b> were a series of elaborate musical revues on Broadway in New York City from 1907 through 1931. Inspired by the Folies Bergère of Paris, <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> were conceived and produced by Florenz Ziegfeld. [...] When Travis accompanied Pearl to a rehearsal, dance supervisor Ned Wayburn spotted her and hired her for {{a role in the}} summer touring company of <b>the</b> 1918 <b>Follies.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind, first published in 1936, the fictional character Rhett Butler warns a group of upper-class secessionists of <b>the</b> <b>folly</b> of war with the North in terms very reminiscent of those Sherman directed to David F. Boyd before leaving Louisiana. Sherman's invasion of Georgia later plays {{a central role in}} the plot of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying The American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly hints at <b>the</b> <b>folly</b> of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E

500|$|In 1912 Stamper {{began writing}} songs for <b>the</b> Ziegfeld <b>Follies</b> of 1913, {{contributing}} Just You and I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as [...] "additional music" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> of 1914 and 1915, but {{he wrote the}} majority of the music for <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> of 1916. and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music of <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> of 1917 was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as [...] "an old hand" [...] for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> of 1918. In addition to his 1918 Follies work, he wrote all the music for Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918, Eaton {{was hired as a}} chorus dancer for the latest edition of <b>the</b> Ziegfeld <b>Follies.</b> She would remain with Ziegfeld for five years, {{appearing}} in <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> in 1918, 1922, and 1923 and the Midnight Frolics of 1919, 1920, and 1921. While she never was made a principal dancer with <b>the</b> <b>Follies,</b> from 1918 onwards, she also worked as an assistant to choreographer Ned Wayburn.|$|R
5|$|Such {{witnesses}} {{are those who}} cannot hear an idle intemperate expression, but they must immediately run to the magistrate to inform; or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night, {{when they were not}} able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense, will pretend to remember everything the next morning, and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>folly</b> and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Castle is a folly {{built in}} 1766 near Henbury in Bristol, England. The castle sits within the Blaise Castle Estate, which also {{includes}} Blaise Castle House, a Grade II* listed 18th-century mansion house. <b>The</b> <b>folly</b> castle is also Grade II* listed and ancillary buildings including the orangery and dairy also have listings. Along with Blaise Hamlet, a group of nine small cottages around a green built in 1811 for retired employees, and various subsidiary buildings, the parkland is listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E
5000|$|An {{editorial}} in The New York Times said that [...] "Will Rogers in <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> is carrying on {{the tradition of}} Aristophanes, and not unworthily." [...] Rogers branched into silent films too, for Samuel Goldwyn's company Goldwyn Pictures. He made his first silent movie, Laughing Bill Hyde, filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in 1918. Many early films were made near the major New York performing market, so Rogers could make the film, yet still rehearse and perform in <b>the</b> <b>Follies.</b> He eventually appeared in most of <b>the</b> <b>Follies,</b> from 1916 to 1925.|$|R

5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them <b>the</b> <b>folly</b> of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|Earlier that afternoon, as Meade {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>folly</b> of Sickles's movement, {{he ordered}} Hancock {{to send a}} division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back {{to the edge of}} Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge at}} Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and <b>the</b> <b>Folly</b> River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} Spalding, the river is laid out with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, {{most of the}} {{building}} was completely gutted and converted into the 934-seat Family Theater; the Family was converted to show movies in 1914. [...] The Family stayed open {{through much of the}} century, and was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> in 1967. [...] Six years later, in 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Follies</b> burned to <b>the</b> ground. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Follies</b> section of <b>the</b> building (including four of the seven bay Williams Block) was demolished soon thereafter, leaving only the three western-most commercial and retail spaces. [...] In the late 1970s the city vacated the property, and the remainder was demolished in early 1990.|$|R
