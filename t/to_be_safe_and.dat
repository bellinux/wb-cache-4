5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the {{development}} of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced.

25|$|Biosantech has {{developed}} a novel vaccine called Tat Oyi, which aims at the tat protein.

Corinne Treger, {{the chief executive of}} French pharmaceutical company Biosantech, claims that if a new trial in 80 patients in 2015 goes well, she said the vaccine could be available in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Helminthic {{therapy is}} the use of {{intestinal}} parasitic nematodes to treat ulcerative colitis, and is based on the premises of the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that helminths ameliorate and are more effective than daily corticosteroids at blocking chemically induced colitis in mice, and a trial of intentional helminth infection of rhesus monkeys with idiopathic chronic diarrhea (a condition similar to ulcerative colitis in humans) resulted in remission of symptoms in 4 out of 5 of the animals treated. A randomised controlled trial of Trichuris suis ova in humans found the therapy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective, and further human trials are ongoing.|$|E
25|$|In Seasons 3 and 5 {{the group}} was {{required}} to choose two players (a boy and a girl) who were allowed to sit out the Right To Stay Challenge, automatically advancing {{as if they had}} survived the challenge. In season 3 the boys were required to choose one girl <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> the girls were required to save a boy, the boys saved Lindi and the girls chose Reece because they were the most attractive in their opinions. In season 5, Darci and Aric were selected to sit out. They were then each allowed to save one other person (of the same gender). Darci chose Kelsey, Aric chose Alex.|$|E

25|$|Nystatin is a polyene {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive. It {{was also the}} first antifungal antibiotic <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective in treating human diseases. Not only did it cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs to balance their side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.|$|E
25|$|The LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II {{was finally}} {{launched}} in September 1938. The DZR Board concluded in its annual report for 1939 that {{public interest in}} zeppelins remained strong, {{if they could be}} shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> a series of demonstration and airmail flights were authorized by the Air Ministry and the Reichspost. One of its first flights was a medium-distance trial to Austria following the Anschluss. Over the next 11 months Graf Zeppelin II made 30 test, promotional, and propaganda tours around Europe. With the advent of World War II it flew for the last time on 20 August 1939 and never entered the transatlantic passenger service for which it was built. The fate of the DZR was decided on 4 March 1940, when Air Minister Hermann Göring ordered LZ 127, LZ 130, and the unfinished LZ 131 melted down for reuse in German military aircraft manufacturing. On 6 May 1940, a Wehrmacht demolition team destroyed the hangar complexes at Frankfurt Airport, ending the fortunes of the DZR.|$|E
25|$|Preclinical {{studies have}} not {{presented}} any sign that bevirimat might {{be associated with}} any specific safety concerns that would limit its clinical use. In vitro preclinical studies in human cells propose that bevirimat should have low potential for cytotoxicity. There {{is no evidence of}} any reproductive or developmental toxicity and it is not immunotoxic. Bevirimat was initially evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics in a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase clinical study in healthy volunteers. It was administered as an oral solution in doses of 25, 50, 100, and 250mg. The plasma concentrations were dose-proportional, and the compound was seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and no serious adverse effects. In one clinical trial, headaches was the most commonly reported side effect of bevirimat, reported by four participants on bevirimat and one on the placebo. The second most common reported side effect was throat discomfort by two participants on bevirimat. No serious adverse effects were reported, all adverse effects reported were mild, and no participants discontinued use of bevirimat because of the adverse effects.|$|E
