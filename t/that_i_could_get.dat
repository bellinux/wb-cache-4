500|$|The band's defense {{attorney}} Steve Graham {{spoke on the}} incident claiming, [...] "There is another side to this. We have witnesses that can testify {{to the fact that}} the accuser came to visit band of her own free will and left on good terms." [...] He also told police that the band members had offered to surrender but never heard anything back, [...] "I made it clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the guys up here ASAP and they would cooperate." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they {{put me in the}} tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> with someone smacking me in the chest.|$|E
500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} June, Tunney competed at the British Championships in Liverpool, United Kingdom. [...] This is {{the third}} and final Olympic Trial to decide the gymnasts that will {{represent}} the United Kingdom at the Olympics. [...] She won the all around competition with a score of 56.750. [...] She said, [...] "It’s totally unexpected to win. The main focus with it being the Olympic trial was to stay clean and I thought if I did <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> maybe in the top 5 but to win is incredible. The trials have all gone really well for me so it’s now just up to the selectors to decide what works best for the Olympics. The first year as a senior couldn’t have gone better really and I’m really enjoying competed in front of big crowds. Having won the junior title last year and moved straight up to win seniors is brilliant, I’m very happy." [...] In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars scoring 14.350, fifth on balance beam scoring 13.550, and fourth on floor scoring 13.500.|$|E

2500|$|The Opera House {{was finally}} completed, and opened in 1973 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. The {{architect}} was {{not invited to}} the ceremony, nor was his name even mentioned during any of the speeches. He was, however, to be recognised later {{when he was asked}} to design updates to the interior of the opera house. The Utzon Room, overlooking Sydney Harbour, was officially dedicated in October 2004. In a statement at the time Utzon wrote: [...] "The fact that I'm mentioned in such a marvellous way, it gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. I don't think you can give me more joy as the architect. It supersedes any medal of any kind <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> and have got." [...] Furthermore, Frank Gehry, one of the Pritzker Prize judges, commented: [...] "Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology, and he persevered through extraordinarily malicious publicity and negative criticism to build a building that changed the image of an entire country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Major.

6000|$|... "Quite sure," [...] he said, in a {{far less}} hesitating and {{undecided}} way than he had before spoken in.
