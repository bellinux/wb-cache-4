You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E

As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down.

500|$|Contemporary reviews have {{praised the}} episode {{as one of}} the show's best installments. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that the episode was [...] "funny, it's clever, and it's {{actually}} quite frightening". Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the faux documentary style, likening it to The Blair Witch Project. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called it [...] "witty, inventive, and intermittently spooky". He argued that the episode was a late-series [...] "gimmick episode" [...] and compared it to the last few seasons of House; although he reasoned that House relied on gimmicks to prop itself up, [...] "X-Cops" [...] is [...] "the work of a creative team which may be running out of ideas, but still has enough gas in the tank <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> where we need to go." [...] Furthermore, Handlen felt that the show used the Cops format to the best of its ability, and that many of the scenes were humorous, startling, or a combination of both.|$|E

Producer Craig Leon, who had seen the Ramones perform {{in the summer of}} 1975, brought the demo to the attention of Sire Records' president Seymour Stein. After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife Linda Stein, the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European progressive rock bands. Drummer Tommy Ramone recalled: [...] "Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> on the label."

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before we went on stage, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album."

Between the sixth and seventh games, the Oilers' forward Wayne Gretzky described Hextall as [...] "probably the best goaltender I've ever played against in the NHL" [...] Edmonton won {{the final game of}} the series to take the Stanley Cup. Robin Finn, writing in The New York Times, said that the team won the title [...] "without their trademark, those endless waves of madcap scoring", primarily due to the [...] "heroics of Hextall". Flyers teammate Rick Tocchet said that when he realised his side were going to lose, his [...] "first thought was to feel sorry for Ronny Hextall, because he did everything he could <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> here and keep us in it." [...] Hextall was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for the most valuable player in the playoffs, becoming only the fourth player from a losing side to be awarded the trophy. During the off-season, Hextall received an eight-game suspension {{for the start of the}} 1987–88 season after his slash on Nilsson. Speaking on behalf of the NHL, Brian O'Neill said that: [...] "There is no justification for any player to swing his stick in retaliation and this is especially the case for a goaltender whose stick, because of its weight, can cause serious injury." ...|$|E

Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted {{to one of the}} seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: [...] "was a ruse <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities.

500|$|Raised {{to acting}} {{squadron}} leader, Gibbes was appointed {{commanding officer of}} No.3 Squadron on 26February 1942. [...] The unit's Tomahawks had by this time been replaced by Kittyhawks, and Gibbes emblazoned his with a cartoon depicting a kangaroo kicking a dachshund in the rear. He claimed a Bf109 (possibly a misidentified Macchi C.202) during the Siege of Tobruk on 7May. On 26May, he was shot down while leading {{an attack on a}} heavily escorted force of Luftwaffe bombers near El Adem. After firing at and probably destroying a Bf109, Gibbes was hit by fire from a Ju88 and had to bail out. Part of his parachute became entangled with the tailplane of his stricken aircraft and he struggled to escape. He broke his ankle in the landing but within six weeks was flying again, his leg still in a cast. Due to his enforced absence, fellow ace Nicky Barr was given command of No.3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26June, at which point Gibbes again took charge of the unit. Barr later said that although Gibbes was not a brilliant shot, he had the keenest eyesight of any pilot he knew when it came to locating enemy aircraft and alerting his fellows for the attack. Another No.3 Squadron pilot, Tom Russell, also recalled that Gibbes was particularly adept at finding targets, and that [...] "if we got scattered in a dogfight he had the uncanny ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> back into formation in a very short space of time".|$|E
