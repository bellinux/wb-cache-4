The main difference is that Red Bull comes in a <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> and silver can while the Thailand Red Bull, or Krating Daeng, is in a smaller gold can. The two drinks also differ in terms of taste —- Red Bull has less sugar and is carbonated. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{look of the}} Na'vi– the humanoids {{indigenous}} to Pandora– {{was inspired by a}} dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on Avatar. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (...) tall, which he thought was [...] "kind of a cool image". Also he said, [...] "I just like blue.

500|$|In August2013, 96AvenueNE was {{extended}} to the east across West Nose Creek and the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to meet the existing interchange at Deerfoot Trail and Airport Trail. [...] It provided an alternative to Beddington Trail and Country Hills Boulveard {{for access to the}} neighbourhood of Harvest Hills. [...] The project included a controversial $470,000 piece of public art, a [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> ring called [...] "Travelling Light" [...] that lies {{on the north side of}} 96Avenue between the railway and Nose Creek. [...] Highly visible from Deerfoot, the ring received national attention and was called [...] "awful" [...] by Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi. [...] The mostly negative feedback prompted Calgary to review its allocation of funds to public art on infrastructure projects. [...] As part of Stoney Trail construction in 2013, Deerfoot Trail was upgraded between the most southerly Bow River crossing north and McKenzie Lake Boulevard. [...] It was widened to six through lanes from Stoney Trail to the Bow River at Calgary's southern limit, and elevated directional ramps were added to the major interchange at Deerfoot and Stoney Trail to support significantly higher traffic levels. [...] A braided ramp was constructed northbound between Cranston Avenue and Stoney Trail, preventing northbound traffic exiting to eastbound Stoney Trail from conflicting with Auburn Bay and Cranston traffic merging onto northbound Deerfoot Trail.|$|E

2500|$|The National Park Service {{undertook}} a lengthy study {{to find a}} species of tree that could thrive in the climate and soil conditions of the capital and better withstand the annual decoration process. Agency officials traveled more than [...] to find a tree that met their specifications. A [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce, located {{at the home of}} Mr. and Mrs. William E. Myers of York, Pennsylvania, was chosen as the new National Christmas Tree planted in the Ellipse in 1978. (The Myers offered to donate the tree, but were paid $1,500 for it.) A second tree, an [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce purchased from a nursery in New Jersey, was planted {{in a corner of the}} Ellipse in early summer 1978 for use as a spare in case the new transplanted tree did not survive. New, stronger cables were used to help brace the tree against high winds. The bronze plaque at the base of the tree was altered slightly to reflect the new date of the tree's transplanting (October 11, 1978).|$|E
2500|$|By December 1976, it {{was clear}} that the National Christmas Tree planted just three years earlier was dying. The {{appearance}} of the tree had deteriorated significantly, with many of the lower branches dead or damaged and many parts of the tree showing large areas of dead needles. Government horticulturalists said the tree had suffered root damage and had not thrived in the hot, damp climate of Washington, D.C. David Rhoads, a citizen from Silver Spring, Maryland, donated his [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce to the National Park Service, chopped off its branches and wired many of them to the lower part of the existing tree to cover up the damage. The tree's plight was so obvious that the public made 112 offers for a new living tree to the government by early December.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 {{tree was}} removed {{and used for}} the Yule log in 1977. An {{anonymous}} resident of Potomac, Maryland donated a [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce as the new National Christmas tree. The new tree was planted on the Ellipse on November 3, 1977. President Jimmy Carter, assisted by his daughter, Amy, lit the tree during a ceremony on December 15, 1977. The tree was decorated with 2,000 five-watt green lamps (not bulbs) symbolizing [...] "Hope," [...] as well as 500 [...] "twinkle lamps" [...] and white ornaments. Due to the ongoing energy crisis, the tree was only lit from dusk to midnight from December 15 to December 26, and from dusk to 10 P.M. from December 27 to January 2. This achieved a further 74 percent reduction in energy use. A petting zoo {{was added to the}} Pagaent of Peace for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|The National Community Christmas Tree {{was again}} {{found to be}} so {{severely}} damaged in 1931 that it was replaced a second time. The National Park Service history of the tree concludes that {{although there is no}} documentation that the tree was removed, photographic evidence clearly shows the [...] tall Norway spruce had been replaced by a [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce. The National Park Service believes this tree was obtained from the Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capitol (an independent federal agency) in the spring of 1931. During the 1931 ceremony, a buzzer went off when Hoover lit the tree at 5:00 P.M. Because the button he pressed was not actually connected to the electricity, the buzzer alerted another official to actually light the tree. The button the president pushed would not be reconnected to actual electricity again until 1980.|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 National Christmas Tree {{suffered}} several near-disasters. The [...] <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> spruce from South Dakota's Black Hills {{was carried}} to Washington, D.C., on a train. [...] The train derailed twice {{on its way}} to the city. The weekend before the tree lighting ceremony, the tree blew over in high winds and several cut branches had to be attached to the tree to replace damaged ones. A few days after the tree was lit, lightbulbs on the lower half of the tree began exploding after a fireproofing liquid applied to the sockets began causing shorts in the strings of lights. No anti-war protests occurred during the tree lighting ceremony in 1970, however. Women Strike for Peace temporarily won a court order permitting them to set up an anti-Vietnam War display of 11 lighted styrofoam tombstones listing the number of American war dead near the pageant, but this ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit two days later on December 18. (The anti-war display was set up on the Washington Monument grounds instead.) The 1970 tree was lit by President Richard Nixon and Andre Proctor, a local District of Columbia child whom President Nixon picked out of the crowd at the last moment to assist him with the tree-lighting. The 1970 Pageant of Peace also included a tree dedicated to prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action.|$|E

60|$|Among these Claude {{had found}} a little lawn, guarded by great rocks, out of every cranny of which the ashes grew as freely as on flat ground. Their feet were bedded deep in sweet fern and wild raspberries, and golden-rod, and purple scabious, and <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> campanulas. Above them, and before them, and below them, the ashes shook their green {{filigree}} in the bright sunshine; and through them glimpses were seen of the purple cliffs above, and, right in front, of the great cataract of Nant Gwynnant, a long snow-white line zigzagging down coal-black cliffs for many a hundred feet, and above it, depth beyond depth of purple shadow away into {{the very heart of}} Snowdon, up the long valley of Cwm-dyli, to the great amphitheatre of Clogwyn-y-Garnedd; while over all the cone of Snowdon rose, in perfect symmetry, between his attendant peaks of Lliwedd and Crib Coch.|$|E

He finds the delicious huddle of the gabled, pigeon-haunted roof of a certain brown old {{building}} at Frame, with poppies and gladiolus and hollyhock crowding the beautiful foreground. He finds--apparently in the same place--the tangle of the hardy flowers that come while the roses are still in bloom, with the <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> larkspurs standing high among them. He finds the lilies, white and red, at Broadway, and the poppies, which have dropped most of their petals--apparently to let the roses, which are just coming out, give their grand party.

60|$|Then, taking Jaqueline {{up on one}} hand, {{on which}} she sat {{as if on a}} chair, he crossed a few ranges of {{mountains}} in as many strides.

You have heard of whirlpools in water; well, this was just like a whirlpool of air. Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it; then he tossed Jaqueline up, and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her, as if on a tide of water, always round and round in narrowing circles, till she was sucked down into the hollow hill. Even as she went, she seemed to remember the hill, as if she had dreamed about it, and the shape and colour of the country. But presently she sank softly on to a couch, in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall. All around her the floor was of white and red marble, but on one side it seemed to end in black nothing.|$|E

There steals upon my sense the ghost of an odor from pines that canopy the ambuscade. I feel upon my cheek the morning mist that shrouds the hostile camp unaware of its doom, and my blood stirs at the ringing rifle-shot of the solitary sentinel. Unfamiliar landscapes, glittering with sunshine or sullen with rain, come to me demanding recognition, pass, vanish and give place to others. Here in the night stretches a wide and blasted field studded with half-extinct fires burning redly with I know not what presage of evil. Again I shudder as I note its desolation and its awful silence. Where was it? To what monstrous inharmony of death was it the visible prelude? ...|$|E
60|$|And Whit-Monday came. At half-past ten the rude {{music of}} the band of the Friendly Society came pealing {{from the top of}} the hill, then {{appeared}} two tall flags, crowned with guelder roses and peonies, then the great blue drum, the clarionet blown by red-waist-coated and red- faced Mr. Appleton, the three flutes and the triangle, all at their loudest, causing some of the spectators to start, and others to dance. Then behold the whole procession of labourers, in white round frocks, blue ribbons in their hats, and <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> staves in their hands. In the rear, the confused mob, women and children, cheerful faces and mirthful sounds everywhere. These were hushed as the flags were lowered to pass under the low-roofed gateway of the churchyard, and all was still, except the trampling of feet on the stone floor. Then the service began, the responses were made in full and hearty tones, almost running into a chant, the old 133rd Psalm was sung as loudly and as badly as usual, a very short but very earnest sermon was preached, and forth came the troop again.|$|E
6000|$|Resuming our ride, we dismounted, {{after four}} miles, at the half-way Mahattah ("halting-place"): it is a rond-point in the Wady Sadr, marked from afar by a <b>tall</b> <b>blue</b> pyramid, the Jebel el-Ga'lah (Jálah). We {{spent some time}} {{examining}} this interesting bulge. Here the Jibál el-Tihámah end, and the eastern parallel range, the Jibál el-Shafah, begins. The former belong to the Huwaytát and to Egypt; the latter, partly to the Ma'ázah and to Syria. The geographical frontier is well marked by two large watercourses disposed upon a meridian, and both feeding the main drain, the Sadr-Tiryam. To the north the Wady Sawádah divides the granitic Harb from the porphyritic Jebel Sawádah; while the southern Wady Aylán separates the Dibbagh from the Jebel Aylán, a tall form distinctly visible from the Upper Shárr. The rest of our eastward march will now be through the Shafah massif. It resembles on a lower scale the Tihámah Gháts; but it wholly wants their variety, their beauty, and their grandeur. The granites which before pierced the porphyritic traps in all directions, now appear only at intervals; and this, I am told, is the case throughout the northern, as we {{found it to be}} in the southern, prolongation of the [...] "Lip"-range. At the same time there is no distinct geographical separation between the two parallels; and both appear, not as if parted by neutral ground, but rather as topographical continuations of each other.|$|E
