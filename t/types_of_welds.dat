5000|$|Butt welds are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a butt weld are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of welding material possible. Butt welds are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, butt welds can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. "December 2006. "The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop and {{validate}} finite element models of the friction stir welding process for butt and lap welds for specific experimental cases that in effect enhances the predictability of temperature evolution in the joined workpiece. Significant {{research has been conducted}} on butt weld thermal process but limited study has been conducted on lap welds. Through examination of several process parameters critical to both weld and lap weld operations insights into process characterization of process parameters could be made. In this study three dimensional finite element heat transfer models using the commercial code LSDYNA were developed to obtain the temperature distribution in the workpiece for two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> namely butt joints and lap joints. For the lap weld model a step function for thermal conductance between sheets was applied to account for varying contact resistance. The developed finite element models were validated with published experimental data. Parametric studies were performed involving both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> including process parameters such as tool travel rate and rotational tool velocity for different aluminium alloys...|$|E

40|$|Aluminium {{stiffened}} panels {{have been}} increasingly used in marine, offshore and transportation industries, especially where high strength/weight ratio structures are highly required. However, the ultimate strength of aluminium structures can be seriously deteriorated by heat-affected zones (HAZ) caused by welding in assembly and construction. Existing design codes {{may not be}} able to appropriately reflect the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels with the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> and residual stresses considered and discussed in this thesis work. The scope of this thesis work is to systematically investigate the ultimate strength and collapse behaviour of three types of aluminium stiffened panels considering the effect of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> the residual stresses caused by relevant welds and the combination of welds and the relevant residual stresses, under axial compression and transverse compression respectively. The systematic investigations are carried out by using nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. Comparisons between the FE results and relevant codes are also conducted to reveal the difference between the FE results and existing design codes. The extensive numerical FE simulations and the comparisons between the FE results and the relevant codes eventually generate and provide information and data that can be used for development of design code formulations for continuous stiffened panels built up of aluminium extrusions or/and welded stiffened aluminium panels, and to help better understand the structural behaviour of aluminium stiffened panels as well. The work in this thesis consists of the following main themes: (1) Overview of key influential factors on the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels; (2) Overview of buckling and collapse behaviour of stiffened steel and aluminium panels, and the arc-length method in nonlinear finite analysis for unstable problems; (3) Meshing approach and convergence study for the models of ultimate and buckling analysis of stiffened panels; (4) Investigation of the effect of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels subjected to axial compression; (5) Investigation of the effect of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels subjected to transverse compression; (6) Parametric sensitivity study with respect to the effect of the material strength of the base materials, the material strength in the HAZ and the extent of the HAZ on the structural capacity of stiffened aluminium panels; (7) Proposed a simplified formula for estimating the transverse ultimate strength of aluminium panels with closed stiffeners, where both the stiffener restraint and the HAZ effect is accounted for; and (8) Comparisons of the ultimate strength obtained by FE analysis and relevant existing design codes. The main contributions of this thesis are: The effect of material softening due to various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> residual stresses caused by relevant welds, and the combined effect of material softening due to various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> and the relevant residual stresses on the axial and transverse ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels has been systematically demonstrated by extensive finite element analyses. Parametric sensitivity study further demonstrates the important effect of material strength in the HAZ and the extent of HAZ on the structural capacity. Material sensitivity study shows that the stress-strain relationship between the elastic limit and the 0. 2 % proof stress σ 0. 2 significantly affects the capacity of aluminium panels, but the part above the 0. 2 % proof stress σ 0. 2 has a very small effect on the strength, and that the difference of the normalized ultimate strength (divided by the 0. 2 % proof stress σ 0. 2) for a same panel made of the different heattreated aluminium alloys is very small. Comparisons of the ultimate strength obtained by FE analysis and the relevant code formulations reveal that existing codes overestimate strength capacity in some cases, and underestimate strength capacity in other cases. Proposed a simplified formula for estimating the transverse capacity of panels with closed stiffeners for which the transverse capacity is underestimated by existing codes since the strong stiffener restraint effect is not accounted for. In the proposed formula, both the stiffener restraint effect and the HAZ effect on the strength are explicitly included. For large multi-stiffened aluminium panels subjected to transverse compression, the panels may collapse in terms of local or global buckling modes (as described in Appendix K). It is necessary to check the buckling modes before carrying out the capacity check for the panels. If the entire deck is governed by global modes, then the capacity should be estimated and checked based on the global mode of the entire panel. If the entire deck is governed by local plate buckling, then conventional design codes and the relevant simplified formulas may be applicable to check the capacity. Information and data generated by the extensive finite element analyses and comparisons between the FE results and the relevant codes are useful for better understanding on the structural behaviour of aluminium panels, and can be used for improving the existing design codes.

40|$|Inconel 718 {{is widely}} used {{superalloy}} in the Indian space program for high temperature application. Some of the newer applications envisage use of this alloy in very critical high pressure oxygen carrying vessels. The alloy is frequently used in welded condition which requires extensive characterization of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> viz Electron beam welding (EBW) and Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). In many cases the weldability of Inconel 718 {{is found to be}} limited by microfissuring phenomenon in the weld heat affected zone. Microfissures are fine intergranular cracks and their severity strongly depends on pre-weld solution treatment temperature (grain size), weld heat input and concentration of impurities (B, P and S) in the base metal. In the present work, a study was undertaken to compare the microfissuring tendency in EBW and GTAW processes using two pre-weld solution treatment temperatures. The samples were solution treated at 970 °C and 1050 °C to generate different grain sizes. Amount of heat input and cooling rate were calculated since they are known to affect the microfissuring and an effort was made to understand their role on the microfissuring. It was observed that microfissuring susceptibility is more at coarser grain size. Severity is more in EBW. The reasons for this phenomenon have been discussed in this paper correlating microfissuring with microstructures and other factors. Procedures to achieve minimal microfissuring during welding have also been brought out. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the linear vibration welding of nylons reinforced with chopped glass fibers. This process and these materials are already used to make automotive air induction modules. To further integrate more parts into these modules, it is sometimes necessary to use higher temperature more expensive amides. The weld geometries used included mainly T-joint samples, and also butt welds were done, and some further analyses were done on CWF and shear samples made previously. Three different Design of Experiments (DOE) matrices were used to create three sets of T-joint samples which were analyzed to understand the interactions among the process parameters. The usual analysis of variance was extended by multivariate analysis to better define the individual roles of each of the process parameters. Cross-sections of the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds</b> were examined. DOE matrices were also performed on butt welds where the samples were either 3 mm thick welded to 3 mm thick samples, or 6 mm thick to 6 mm thick welds. A set of resistance welds was also done, as this method had produced very strong welds in induction heated samples. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|A weld is {{made when}} {{two pieces of}} metal are united or fused {{together}} using heat or pressure, and sometimes both. There are several different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> each having their own unique properties and microstructure. Strength is a property normally used in deciding which kind of weld is suitable for a certain metal or joint. Depending on the weld process used and the heat required for that process, the weld and the heat-affected zone undergo microstructural changes resulting in stronger or weaker areas. The heat-affected zone (HAZ) is the region that has experienced enough heat to cause solid-state microstructural changes, {{but not enough to}} melt the material. This area is located between the parent material and the weld, with the grain structure growing as it progresses respectively. The optimal weld would have a short HAZ and a small fluctuation in strength from parent metal to weld. To determine the strength of the weld and decide whether it is suitable for the specific joint certain properties are looked at, among these are ultimate tensile strength, 0. 2 % offset yield strength and hardness. Ultimate tensile strength gives the maximum load the metal can stand while the offset yield strength gives the amount of stress the metal can take before it is 0. 2 % longer than it was originally. Both of these are good tests, but they both require breaking or deforming the sample in some way. Hardness testing, however, provides an objective evaluation of weld strengths, and also the difference or variation in strength across the weld and HAZ which is difficult to do with tensile testing. Hardness is the resistance to permanent or plastic deformation and can be taken at any desired point on the specimen. With hardness testing, it is possible to test from parent metal to weld and see the difference in strength as you progress from parent material to weld. Hardness around grain boundaries and flaws in the material will show how these affect the strength of the metal while still retaining the sample. This makes hardness testing a good test for identifying grain size and microstructure...|$|E
