5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> play sports, boxing, {{or other}} leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|Young Aurobindo {{was brought}} up {{speaking}} English but used Hindustani to communicate with servants. Although his family were Bengali, his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings {{were sent to the}} English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling, in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.|$|E
5000|$|One of Nosmo's act {{starters}} {{was when}} a young pageboy would come over to him carrying his luggage. Once he had handed it to Nosmo, Nosmo would say to him [...] "how much do I owe you" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> say [...] "2 nicker" [...] whilst flicking the V at him (meaning to show the 2 fingers), Nosmo took it as an insult and <b>would</b> slap <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> across <b>the</b> face and then <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> slap across <b>the</b> face back.|$|R
50|$|After {{the events}} at Battle Creek, Little Chief warned the {{settlers}} that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> later kill {{a white man}} for revenge.|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> not listen, {{and crying}} out to her, 'I would rather get them,' thrust {{his hand into}} the date cask.|$|R
25|$|Together Gory and Herlinda had six children, {{two girls}} and four boys – <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> all {{end up in}} {{professional}} wrestling.|$|E
25|$|The {{festival is}} {{traditionally}} celebrated by boys throwing water over girls they like and spanking them with pussy willows. Boys would sneak into girls' homes at daybreak on Easter Monday and throw containers of water over {{them while they}} were still in bed. This was usually accompanied by a rhyme; in the Polish-American community of Pine Creek, Wisconsin, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> chant Dyngus, dyngus, po dwa jaja; nie chcę chleba tylko jaja ("Dyngus, dyngus, for two eggs; I don't want bread, only eggs").|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} with the {{theological}} students gone and the Headmaster moved out of his rooms to College Gardens, the Main Building was remodelled to better accommodate boarders. Like other schools at the time, the boarders lived in “houses” but unlike other schools, rather than staying on the same house during their time there, they would move from house to house as they progressed through the school. The houses were Bedell House, Castlereagh House and Kelvin House and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> move up through them. They were named after two prominent Irishmen and one Englishman; Anglican clergyman William Bedell,born in Essex but dying in Cavan, Statesman Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh and scientist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin. There was also another house for day pupils named after Lord Wellington.|$|E
60|$|And again {{his father}} offered {{him what he}} would, even the crown itself, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> hear nothing, and went on his way.|$|R
60|$|After he {{had gone}} Mrs. Mulready tried to soothe Ned, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> not listen to her, and in fact {{did not seem to}} hear her.|$|R
6000|$|Hendricks shifted uneasily. It made {{too good}} a target, two people walking along. And <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> slow him down. But he might not come back this way. And if <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> were really all alone-- ...|$|R
25|$|Leopold {{had many}} {{mistress}}es. In 1899, in his sixty-fifth year, Leopold took as a mistress Caroline Lacroix, a sixteen-year-old French prostitute, and they remained {{together for the}} next decade until his death. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Because of these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally. She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death; their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a large fortune, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs. Caroline bore two sons who were probably Leopold's; <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid.|$|E
500|$|Although {{all of the}} orphanage's {{residents}} were given a dose of Epsom salts once {{a week in the}} morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states that because there were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in their pants. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were [...] washed only once a week. Beatings were common, and not just for punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker. Despite this, some former residents say the nuns were [...] "tough but fair" [...] and they [...] were fed three meals a day. Some even stayed in contact with their caregivers once they left.|$|E
2500|$|A {{little known}} fact about the 1945 World Series is that teenage boys worked the games as the ushers in the stands. With most able bodied men away at war, young teenage boys {{were allowed to}} work as ushers. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> line up at the gate outside Briggs Stadium before the game and would be {{selected}} in a fashion similar to how migrant workers are selected to work today. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> volunteer their services, but would receive tips.|$|E
50|$|At age 10, Grigoryants was {{diagnosed}} with an inborn heart defect and a Cardiac dysrhythmia. Elena was warned by the observing physician that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> not live long.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Mr. Porson replied, [...] "for in {{that case}} <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> have to appear {{with him in the}} dock, and that I wish of all things to avoid." ...|$|R
50|$|The king did {{not want}} such a puny little son-in-law. He told <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> had to herd a hundred rabbits and not lose one for four days. The first day, the rabbits scattered, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> used <b>the</b> whistle to bring them back. The second day, the king sent the princess to get one; <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> only trade one for a kiss, and when she had it and had reached {{the gates of the}} castle, he used the whistle, and it came back. The next day, the king sent the queen to get one; <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> only trade one if the queen turned three somersaults, and when she did, the king locked it in a room but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> used his whistle and it came back through a window. The fourth day, the king went himself. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> only trade it if the king kissed his donkey's behind. When the king had gotten the rabbit, he had it killed and skinned and put on to casserole, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> used his whistle and it jumped out of the dish, back into its skin, and back to <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... …Students of all {{religious}} faiths were welcome. Provision {{was made for}} them to attend the church of their choice. Attend church they must. The curriculum would include Christian Evidences as a required subject, and the faculty would teach in ways respecting the evidences of Christianity [...] <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> carry their religious instruction into practice by going to services and participating in church activities.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At the end {{of grammar}} school, one half of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> be dismissed. This half would include future grammar school masters. The other half, [...] "chosen for the superiority of their parts and disposition," [...] would {{continue}} studying three more years at the university, [...] "in the study of such sciences as they shall chuse". Jefferson considered the university to be the capstone of the educational system. To accommodate the influx of students, Jefferson proposed that the College of William and Mary be enlarged [...] "and extended to all the useful sciences".|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Vaughan later {{remarked that}} [...] "English is a Language the Author {{was not born}} to." [...] Both boys were sent to school under Matthew Herbert, rector of Llangattock, to whom both wrote tributes. Since their {{interest}} was so clearly shared, the two brothers' intimate acquaintance with hermeticism may have dated from those years. Matthew Herbert may have reinforced a devotion to church and monarchy that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have learned at home. Like several others among Vaughan's clerical acquaintances, he later proved uncompromising during the interregnum. He was imprisoned, his property was seized, and he narrowly avoided banishment.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> end {{up being}} {{subjected}} to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.|$|R
50|$|Gutei {{raised his}} finger {{whenever}} he was asked a question about Zen. A boy attendant began to imitate him in this way. When anyone asked <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> what his master had preached about, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> raise his finger.|$|R

2500|$|Under the old 'Get the Credit' Scheme, Company Section {{members could}} gain one Target badge first (reduced from the {{required}} two in an award reorganisation {{a few years}} ago, though Target Two could still be completed as an optional extra), then five other badges (Interests, Adventure, Leadership, Physical and Community) with red and blue flashes around them. After about three years, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have gained all five badges with both red and blue flashes. This enabled the boys to attend a Leadership Training Course and potentially attain the President's Badge. This is a necessary prerequisite for the Brigade's highest award [...] the Queen's Badge.|$|E
2500|$|White {{had been}} in Phillips County {{for a brief time}} when he learned there were rumors {{floating}} about him. He quickly took the first train back to Little Rock. The conductor told the young man that he was leaving [...] "just when the fun is going to start," [...] because they had found out that there was a [...] "damned yellow nigger passing for white and the boys are going to get him." [...] When White asked what <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> do to the man, the conductor told White that [...] "when they get through with him he won't pass for white no more!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The few {{young women}} {{compared}} to {{number of young}} men led to the women's being paid unwanted attention. Maud's classmate, Jessie Mary, wrote that the [...] "oys (or young men as I guess they call themselves) abound". She noted that girls were frequently ogled by the boys, who enjoyed teasing them. When a girl was late, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> loudly clap as she sat down. Each October, the freshman class would elect about twelve positions, including a president and vice president, a treasurer, a class essayist, and a marshal. The marshal was tasked with organizing parties and other social occurrences. Girls were generally barred {{from most of the}} positions. However, an annual tradition of the boys was to [...] "nominate the most precocious girl" [...] and then [...] "gossip about her viciously". Maud was nominated.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> have turned, but {{his sister}} had {{hold of his}} hand. 'Owen, there he is! I'll have him,' and as the crab scuttled sidelong after the {{retreating}} tide, on plunged the children.|$|R
6000|$|When they left, Uncle Tim patted Hugh on the head,--a liberty <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> have resented if the {{delightful}} old gentleman had {{not followed}} {{it up by}} saying, with a reckless generosity worthy of record,-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Pit Stop / Pity City (One of <b>the</b> Nasty <b>Boys</b> <b>would</b> {{raise their}} arm, exposing their armpit while <b>the</b> other Nasty <b>Boy</b> <b>would</b> seize a victim {{by the back}} of the neck and rub his face into <b>the</b> other Nasty <b>Boy's</b> armpit) ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{then moved}} to Chelsea for a fee of [...] £50 and was made club captain. Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his {{defenders}} were not trying hard enough, he would walk off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal {{in an effort to}} distract the opposition even more. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being. Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, Bradford City.|$|E
2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} to play a little, I was chosen to give all the bugle calls. [...] I {{had to get up}} in the morning before the others and arouse {{everybody}} by blowing the morning call. [...] Evenings at ten minutes before nine o’clock I blew again. [...] Then all of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and we were supposed to be in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades. On May 24, 1883, Luther led the first “real American” band to cross the Brooklyn Bridge at its grand opening ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{regional}} {{variants of}} po dyngusie, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> march {{through the village}} with one of their number dressed as a bear with a bell on his head – either wearing a real bearskin or a stand-in made of pea vines. The group would go from door to door collecting [...] "gifts for the bear" [...] before [...] "drowning" [...] the bear in a nearby stream or pond. This was probably an adaptation of a traditional ceremony to drown a straw figure of Marzanna, the spirit of winter. The [...] "bears" [...] were often invited in as they were believed {{to ensure that there}} would be a good harvest, reflecting a very ancient belief in the power of the bear to prevent evil, encourage crop growth and cure diseases. In Mazowsze and Małopolska, boys wearing bearskins would also chase girls. Similar custom also is (in polish are) Siwki.|$|E
6000|$|Occasionally at a {{stoppage}} {{the guard}} would {{look into the}} compartment and say to <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> [...] "All right, my man. Your box is safe in the van." [...] <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> say, [...] "Yes," [...] without animation, would try to smile, and fail.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very pretty, that's {{the real}} thing. I {{am glad to}} find you in good trim. I was afraid Theodora had taken you too far, and the heat would knock you up, and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> roar till you were all manner of colours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} do that," [...] said Mrs. Doan, now {{reconciled}} to the girl's departure. Reginald was growing fast, and with Madame Sabot and an English nurse in readiness {{to fill the}} Irish maid's place, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> find his daily education an easy matter.|$|R
