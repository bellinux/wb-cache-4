25|$|Richard Wagner is the {{earliest}} composer most specifically {{associated with the}} concept of leitmotif. His cycle of four operas, Der Ring des Nibelungen (the music for which was written between 1853 and 1869), uses hundreds of leitmotifs, often related to specific characters, <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> situations. While some of these leitmotifs occur in only one of the operas, many recur throughout the entire cycle.|$|E
25|$|A {{name is a}} {{label for}} any noun. Names can {{identify}} a class or category of <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.

25|$|Dating {{violence}} is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships. When surveyed, 10-45% of adolescents reported having experienced physical {{violence in the}} context of a relationship while a quarter to a third of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression. This reported aggression includes hitting, throwing <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> slaps, although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit. Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood. In heterosexual couples, there is no significant difference between the rates of male and female aggressors, unlike in adult relationships.|$|E
25|$|Receptive aphasia: The {{patients}} {{suffer from}} lesions or damage {{located in the}} left temproparietal lobe. Receptive Aphasic patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty saying <b>things</b> <b>or</b> describing things, these people showed {{that they could do}} well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease would say the dog goed home.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{abuse is}} a form of abuse when one {{intimate}} partner has control over the other partner's access to economic resources. Marital assets are used as a means of control. Economic abuse may involve preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, limiting what the victim may use, or by otherwise exploiting economic resources of the victim. Economic abuse diminishes the victim's capacity to support themselves, increasing dependence on the perpetrator, including reduced access to education, employment, career advancement, and assets acquirement. Forcing or pressuring a family member to sign documents, to sell <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> to change a will are forms of economic abuse.|$|E

25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability {{is the extent to}} which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.|$|E
25|$|Each {{science has}} its own unique sets of {{laboratory}} equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many <b>things</b> <b>or</b> qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime {{was one of the}} first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.|$|E

25|$|Although Eutropius, {{supported}} by minor references {{in the works}} of Cassius Dio and Julian the Apostate' describes the widespread depopulation of the province after the siege of Sarmizegetusa Regia and the suicide of king Decebalus, there are issues with this interpretation. The remaining manuscripts of Eutropius' Breviarium ab urbe condita, which is the principal source for the depopulation of Roman Dacia after the conquest, are not consistent. Some versions describe the depletion of men after the war, other variants describe the depletion of <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> possibly resources, after Trajan's conquest. Archaeological evidence shows the continuation of traditional Dacian burial practices; ceramic manufacturing continued throughout the Roman period, in both the province as well as the periphery where Roman control was non-existent. Differing interpretations can be made from the final scene on Trajan's Column, which either depicts a Dacian emigration, accelerating the depopulation of Dacia, or Dacians going back to their settlements after yielding to Roman authority.|$|E
25|$|In 1821 the NWC was {{merged into}} their {{powerful}} competitor, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Douglas' contract was placed onto the HBC's payroll. He quickly {{moved up the}} strict system where <b>things</b> <b>or</b> people are in separate levels of importance of the company. In 1825, he {{was put in charge}} of the founding of the Fort Dark red trading post in what is now northern Alberta. He was next assigned at Fort St. James on Stuart Lake, headquarters of the Company's New Caledonia District, roughly located within modern British Columbia. In 1827 he established Fort Connolly on Bear Lake. The station was named after his manager William Connolly, who was impressed by Douglas' skills and viewed him favourably. Because of their close relations, Connolly agreed to Douglas marrying his Métis daughter Amelia Connolly. Her mother was Cree and likely also Métis. Douglas and Amelia were married on 27 April 1828 'à la façon du pays', a ceremony repeated almost a decade later at Fort Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple <b>things,</b> <b>or</b> they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E

25|$|Views {{concerning}} {{problems are}} extremely varied. Several {{pages in the}} notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences. Problems {{can be viewed as}} synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective <b>things</b> <b>or</b> subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life. Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as Approaches to problems, Beyond the problem-lobby mindset, or Problem perception and levels of awareness.|$|E
