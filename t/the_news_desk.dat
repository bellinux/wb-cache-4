25|$|On September 13, 2006, Today {{moved back}} into the revamped Studio 1A space. The new studio was divided into five {{different}} sections on the lower level including an interview area, the couch area, <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>desk,</b> the performance/interview/extra space area, and home base, {{which is where the}} anchors start the show.

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was watched by 2.59 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of If magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending [...] "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, [...] "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> And because South Park {{can be made in}} like a week—and I’m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product—they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: [...] "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically." [...] IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel {{and the extent to which}} Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot [...] "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".|$|E

According to Nick Davies in Flat Earth News, the paper originally intended an attack on the groups arguing for an inquiry into the Lawrence murder, but the paper's reporter Hal Austin, on interviewing Neville and Doreen Lawrence, realised that some [...] years earlier, Neville had worked at Dacre's home in Islington as a plasterer, and <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> instructed Austin to [...] "Do something sympathetic" [...] about the case.
