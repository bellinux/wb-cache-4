5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Warsaw and the Silent Sejm settled {{numerous}} contentious {{issues and}} resulted in limited reform of the state, encompassing {{a part of what}} was demanded by the more enlightened szlachta political publicists (Stanisław Szczuka, Stanisław Dunin-Karwicki). Poland-Saxony relationship was strictly limited to a personal union. Saxon ministers were barred from ruling on matters concerning the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The King was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> only 1200 personal guard Saxon soldiers and was not allowed to reside in Saxony for prolonged periods.|$|E

For instance, one needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold two mental units in mind <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> decide if one number is bigger than another number. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> add them, the person needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold three units, that is, the two numbers plus the arithmetic operation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied, such as addition or subtraction. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand proportionality, one must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep in mind five units, that is the two pairs of numbers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared and their relation.|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of the KC-97 and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers was pushed by the Cold War requirement of the United States <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> fleets of nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a Soviet strike for mutual assured destruction, or to bomb the U.S.S.R. first had it been ordered {{to do so by}} the President of the United States. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a first strike against the bombers' airfields could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} source of revenue is television. The 1980s saw {{competition}} between terrestrial broadcasters {{for the rights to}} show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position – without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.|$|E
500|$|The US tour {{started on}} 20 November at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. The group were nervous about playing Quadrophenia after the British tour, {{especially}} Moon. Before the show, {{he was offered}} some tranquillisers from a fan. Just after the show started, the fan collapsed and was hospitalised. Moon's playing, meanwhile, became incredibly erratic, particularly during Quadrophenia where {{he did not seem}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> time with the backing tapes. Towards the end of the show, during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he passed out over his drumkit. After a 20-minute wait, Moon reappeared onstage, but after a few bars of [...] "Magic Bus", collapsed again, and was immediately taken to hospital. Scot Halpin, an audience member, convinced promoter Bill Graham to let him play drums, and the group closed the show with him. Moon had a day to recover, and by the next show at the Los Angeles Forum, was playing to his usual strength. The group began {{to get used to the}} backing tapes, and the remainder of gigs for the US tour were successful.|$|E

500|$|Mike Fahey, {{writing for}} Kotaku, called the game brilliant, and {{compared}} the gameplay, graphics and music favorably to their Metroid II counterparts. Siliconera Ishaan found the game impressive, {{and said that}} it stands out from other fan-made remakes. Sam Machkovech at Ars Technica said that the game would be a delight to people who liked Zero Mission, and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game {{to the point that}} he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a good job at filling the [...] "void" [...] left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it [...] "even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1". Gonçalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people {{would be willing to pay}} money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a [...] "great game in its own right" [...] regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the [...] "eerie charm" [...] of Metroid II, but found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.|$|E

2500|$|The 747's {{cargo door}} used {{a series of}} {{electrically}} operated latch cams into which the door-edge latch pins closed. The cams then rotated into a closed position, holding the door closed. A series of L-shaped arms (called locking sectors) were actuated by the final manual moving of a lever to close the door; these were designed to reinforce the unpowered latch cams and prevent them from rotating into an unlocked position. [...] The locking sectors were made out of aluminum and were too thin a gauge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the latch cams from moving into the unlocked position against {{the power of the}} door motors. Electrical switches cut electrical power to the cargo door when the outer handle was closed; but if one of those were faulty, the motors could still draw power and rotate the latch cam to the open position. The same event could happen if frayed wires were able to power the cam-motor, even if the circuit power was cut by the safety switch.|$|E
