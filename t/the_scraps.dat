5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Items must be {{collected}} and moved round the screen or {{placed in the}} inventory box to complete cases. Characters will either offer the player objects, or the player must seek out items that can be taken. Collectible items can be kept for later use by dragging the object into the Inventory box. Players must also look for scraps of the Carmen Notes, which describe where each thief will hide. These notes have each been torn into three pieces {{to make them more}} difficult to find. The player must click on <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> of paper to assemble them into a whole note. Once all the pieces of the Carmen note are found, the ACME handcuffs (known as Time Cuffs) activate and the player can decode Carmen's message to deduce her henchmen's location. Using the Time Cuffs on the relevant object reveals the thief, whom the Good Guide then arrests. After capturing each crook (with Dee Cryption captured once and the others captured twice), the player pursues Carmen herself.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scrap</b> basket is {{then taken}} to the melt shop, the roof is swung off the furnace, and the furnace is charged with <b>scrap</b> from <b>the</b> basket. Charging {{is one of the}} more {{dangerous}} operations for the EAF operators. A lot of potential energy is released by the tonnes of falling metal; any liquid metal in the furnace is often displaced upwards and outwards by <b>the</b> solid <b>scrap,</b> and <b>the</b> grease and dust on <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> is ignited if the furnace is hot, resulting in a fireball erupting. In some twin-shell furnaces, <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> is charged into the second shell while the first is being melted down, and pre-heated with off-gas from the active shell. Other operations are continuous charging—pre-heating scrap on a conveyor belt, which then discharges <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> into <b>the</b> furnace proper, or charging <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> from a shaft set above the furnace, with off-gases directed through the shaft. Other furnaces can be charged with hot (molten) metal from other operations.|$|R

2500|$|Contemporary chroniclers {{identify}} {{the source of}} the fashion for slashing garments to the actions of Swiss soldiers {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Grandson in 1476. [...] Supposedly the Swiss plundered the rich fabrics of the Burgundian nobles and used <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> to patch their tattered clothes. In reality, images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-15th century, although the German fashion for [...] "many small all-over slits" [...] may have begun here. Whatever its origin, the fad for multiple slashings spread to German Landsknechts and thence to France, Italy, and England, where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-17th century.|$|E

Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with the windows open due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, [...] "...within official channels." [...] Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the Robins AFB, Georgia Museum of Aviation with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> into ingots for disposal.|$|E
2500|$|Feeding {{table scraps}} to a dog is {{generally}} not recommended, at least in excess. Just as in humans, a dog's diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients, carbohydrates, and proteins {{in order to give}} them the minerals and vitamins that they need. Dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural, normal diet; wild and feral dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat. In addition, a human diet is not ideal for a dog: the concept of a [...] "balanced" [...] diet for a [...] carnivore like a dog {{is not the same as}} in an omnivorous human. Dogs will usually eat all <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> and treats they are fed: usually too much food. While not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs (see above), many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the relevant problem of iron-and-steel companies saving on purchasing <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> metal. <b>The</b> {{analysis of the}} current state of <b>the</b> ferrous <b>scrap</b> market in <b>the</b> Russian Federation, trends of its development, led the authors to an opportunity to reduce the cost for purchasing <b>scrap</b> trough <b>the</b> optimal distribution of the regions between Russian iron-and-steel companies where they purchase ferrous <b>scrap.</b> <b>The</b> optimization of the regional structure of <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> procurement taking into account the regional volumes of its generation and consumption results from using the linear programming methods applying three variants of the problem statement: minimizing the total cost of <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> delivery to <b>the</b> factory, minimizing the total cost of <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> at <b>the</b> “export parity” price with delivery, minimizing the total cost of <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> at <b>the</b> actual prices with delivery. The authors have developed software for performing the calculations. The source are the database of the JSC Russian Railways, which provides information about the transportation of <b>the</b> ferrous <b>scrap</b> between stations of the Russian Federation by railroad; railway rates guide between railway stations of the Russian Federation; statistical data on <b>the</b> prices for <b>scrap</b> metal of <b>the</b> type 3 A in “export windows”; actual purchasing prices for <b>the</b> <b>scrap</b> of <b>the</b> 3 A type for the range of separate companies of the Russian Federation for several years. As a result, the authors have obtained the optimal regional structure of scrap purchasing for customers in the Russian Federation.

With the agreement of Mona's parents, police sought Roberts' assistance. Upon handling a silk dress the child had worn shortly before her disappearance, Roberts immediately knew the child was dead. She later informed police Mona had been murdered, adding that she had taken to {{a house with a}} water-filled ditch on one side, and that she had spent much of the time at this household copying [...] "something out of a book" [...] (police had not informed Roberts of <b>the</b> <b>scraps</b> of children's drawings or writings discovered at Peacehaven). Roberts stated the child had been strangled to death in an upstairs bedroom of these premises, before her murderer had placed her body in a sack and transported her remains to a river beyond the field which existed behind this house, adding that the police would [...] "find the child's body there".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the workday}} was ending on the {{afternoon}} of Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire flared up at approximately 4:40 PM in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor. The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 PM by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the eighth floor. Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon. The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings {{by the time of the}} fire. Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps which were left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. <b>The</b> <b>scraps</b> piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable. Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection. A New York Times article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the sewing machines. A series of articles in Collier's noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory in order to collect insurance. The Insurance Monitor, a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was [...] "fairly saturated with moral hazard." [...] Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.|$|E
