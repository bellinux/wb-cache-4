40|$|Studies of {{the weak}} form of the capital market {{efficiency}} theorem infer {{that there are no}} predictable properties of the time series of prices of <b>traded</b> <b>securities</b> on organized markets. We examine the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis with respect to daily closing prices to indicate evidence that daily closing prices have predictable properties. Furthermore, this study of individual <b>securities</b> prices of <b>traded</b> <b>securities</b> on organized markets corroborates previous findings of studies of stock market indexes both in the United States and in other nations' bourses or stock exchanges. Often, these studies indicated that daily patterns are present in the times series of securities prices. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify the existence of time series characteristics of daily stock prices of <b>securities</b> <b>traded</b> on organized exchanges. This study differs from previous studies where the focus was on index numbers of daily stock market prices rather than the actual prices of <b>traded</b> <b>securities</b> in the United States.

We first characterise security in the context of a global public good, before studying the financing conditions and the discriminating criteria of the supply of the global public good security. We then presents a critical analysis of the various possible sources and instruments for financing the global public good security and propose different financing scenarios, each one based on a specific allocation of responsibilities among the players in security. We conclude by considering the role of the international institutions as project managers of the financing and implementation of the <b>security</b> of international <b>trade.</b> international, financing, global public goods, international <b>trade,</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R
