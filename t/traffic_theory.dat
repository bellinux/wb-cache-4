40|$|As {{a typical}} {{self-driven}} many-particle system far from equilibrium, traffic flow exhibits diverse fascinating non-equilibrium phenomena, {{most of which}} are closely related to traffic flow stability and specifically the growth/dissipation pattern of disturbances. However, the <b>traffic</b> <b>theories</b> have been controversial {{due to a lack of}} precise traffic data. We have studied traffic flow from a new perspective by carrying out large-scale car-following experiment on an open road section, which overcomes the intrinsic deficiency of empirical observations. The experiment has shown clearly the nature of car-following, which runs against the traditional <b>traffic</b> flow <b>theory.</b> Simulations show that by removing the fundamental notion in the traditional car-following models and allowing the traffic state to span a two-dimensional region in velocity-spacing plane, the growth pattern of disturbances has changed qualitatively and becomes qualitatively or even quantitatively in consistent with that observed in the experiment.

Macroscopic traffic equations with multi-valued fundamental diagrams are derived from different microscopic and kinetic models. Numerical experiments show similarities and differences of the models, in particular, for the appearance and structure of stop and go waves for highway traffic in dense situations. For all models, but one, phase transitions can appear near bottlenecks depending on the local density and velocity of the flow...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{applications}} of Kerner’s three-phase <b>traffic</b> <b>theory</b> is the methods called ASDA/FOTO (Automatische StauDynamikAnalyse (Automatic tracking of wide moving jams) and Forecasting Of Traffic Objects). ASDA/FOTO is a software tool able to process large traffic data volumes {{quickly and efficiently}} on freeway networks (see examples from three countries, Figure 11). ASDA/FOTO works in an online traffic management system based on measured traffic data.

50|$|Thus Kerner’s {{definitions}} J and S for {{the wide}} moving jam and synchronized flow phases of his three-phase <b>traffic</b> <b>theory</b> are indeed associated with common empirical features of traffic congestion.|$|E
50|$|In Kerner's {{three phase}} <b>traffic</b> <b>theory,</b> in {{addition}} to the free flow traffic phase (F), there are two traffic phases in congested traffic: the synchronized flow traffic phase (S) and the wide moving jam phase. One of the main results of Kerner's theory is that traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a random (probabilistic) phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F → S transition) that occurs in a metastable state of free flow at a highway bottleneck. This basic result of Kerner's theory shows the incommensurability of three-phase <b>traffic</b> <b>theory</b> with all earlier traffic flow theories.|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{detailed}} investigation of breakdowns in traffic and transportation networks. It shows empirically that transitions from free flow to so-called synchronized flow, initiated by local disturbances at network bottlenecks, display a nucleation-type behavior: while small disturbances in free flow decay, larger ones grow further {{and lead to}} breakdowns at the bottlenecks. Further, it discusses in detail {{the significance of this}} nucleation effect for <b>traffic</b> and transportation <b>theories,</b> and the consequences this has for future automatic driving, traffic control, dynamic traffic assignment, and optimization in traffic and transportation networks. Starting from a large volume of field traffic data collected from various sources obtained solely through measurements in real world traffic, the author develops his insights, with an emphasis less on reviewing existing methodologies, models and theories, and more on providing a detailed analysis of empirical traffic data and drawing consequences regarding the minimum requirements for any <b>traffic</b> and transportation <b>theories</b> to be valid. The book - proves the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown in networks - discusses the origin of the failure of classical <b>traffic</b> and transportation <b>theories</b> - shows that the three-phase theory is incommensurable with the classical <b>traffic</b> <b>theories,</b> and - explains why current state-of-the art dynamic traffic assignments tend to provoke heavy traffic congestion, making it a valuable reference resource for a wide audience of scientists and postgraduate students interested in the fundamental understanding of empirical traffic phenomena and related data-driven phenomenology, as well as for practitioners working in the fields of traffic and transportation engineering...|$|R

50|$|Kerner’s {{three-phase}} <b>traffic</b> <b>theory</b> is {{an alternative}} theory of traffic flow. Probably the most important result of the three-phase theory is that at any time instance there is a range of highway capacities of free flow at a bottleneck. The capacity range is between some maximum and minimum capacities. The range of highway capacities of free flow at the bottleneck in three-phase <b>traffic</b> <b>theory</b> contradicts fundamentally classical traffic theories as well as methods for traffic management and traffic control which at any time instant assume {{the existence of a}} particular deterministic or stochastic highway capacity of free flow at the bottleneck.|$|E
