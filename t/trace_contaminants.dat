Instruments that can operate {{outside of a}} laboratory often are not sensitive enough to detect <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Rapid, portable, and cost-effective measurement systems for <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> in groundwater and other environmental media would thus enhance contaminant detection and cleanup. One potential method is to separate the analyte from the sample and concentrate them to a smaller volume, easing detection and measurement. When small quantities of solid sorbents are used to absorb the target for concentration, this method {{is referred to as}} solid-phase microextraction.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{summarized the}} results of a trade study that evaluated whether <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control within the Constellation Spacesuit PLSS could be achieved without a <b>Trace</b> <b>Contaminant</b> Control System (TCCS) by relying on suit leakage, ullage loss from the carbon dioxide and humidity control system, and other factors. Mallory Jennings and Dr. Glenn Waguespack studied <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> generation rates to verify that values reflected the latest designs for Constellation spacesuit system pressure garment materials and PLSS hardware. They also calculated TCCS sizing and conducted a literature survey to review the latest developments in <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> technologies...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concern over}} <b>trace</b> gaseous <b>contaminant</b> accumulations in the {{enclosed}} atmospheres of long duration spacecraft missions has prompted {{the development of}} a <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> data base on the basis of gas, lithium hydroxide, and charcoal samples collected on Space Shuttle missions. A model <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> gas mixture containing 14 compounds was chosen {{with the aid of a}} FORTRAN program, on the strength of contaminant chemical and toxicological categories, frequency of occurrence, and worst-case concentration. The model gas mixture can be used to test <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control hardware for a manned spacecraft environment...|$|R
40|$|Designers {{of future}} space {{vehicles}} envision simplifying the Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) system {{by combining the}} functions of <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> (TC) control and carbon dioxide removal into one swing-bed system. Flow rates and bed sizes of the TC and CO 2 systems have historically been very different. There is uncertainty {{about the ability of}} <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> sorbents to adsorb adequately in high-flow or short bed length configurations, and to desorb adequately during short vacuum exposures. There is also concern about ambient ammonia levels {{in the absence of a}} condensing heat exchanger. In addition, new materials and formulations have become commercially available, formulations never evaluated by NASA for purposes of <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control. The optimal air revitalization system for future missions may incorporate a swing-bed system for carbon dioxide (CO 2) and partial <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control, with a reduced-size, low-power, targeted <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> system supplying the remaining contaminant removal capability. This paper describes the results of a comparative experimental investigation into materials for <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control that might be part of such a system. Ammonia sorbents and low temperature carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalysts are the foci. The data will be useful to designers of AR systems for future flexible path missions. This is a continuation of work presented in a prior year, with extended test results...|$|R

Crystallization, desiccation, lyophilization and spray drying are typical unit operations. Depending on the product and its intended use, polishing may also include operations to sterilize the product and remove or deactivate <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> which might compromise product safety. Such operations might include the removal of viruses or depyrogenation.|$|E
5000|$|Agreement between {{theoretical}} predictions (based {{on developing}} quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later explained by John Bardeen as {{due to the}} extreme [...] "structure sensitive" [...] behavior of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts of impurities. Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> produced differing experimental results. This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{dioxide and}} <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> are removed by the Air Revitalization System. This is a NASA rack, placed in Tranquility, {{designed}} to provide a Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), a Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) to remove hazardous trace contamination from the atmosphere and a Major Constituent Analyser (MCA) to monitor nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and water vapour. The Air Revitalization System was flown to the station aboard STS-128 and was temporarily installed in the Japanese Experiment Module pressurised module.

50|$|During general {{manufacturing}} of the product, the product may sometimes {{be used in}} circumstances which the specifications indicate would be acceptable however when the product is actually used in those circumstances, a problem is encountered. Engineering will typically perform a root cause analysis {{in order to determine}} the root cause of the problem. In some cases, manufacturing changes may need to be made such as <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> being introduced during some phase of manufacturing.

50|$|Groundwater (which {{may contain}} {{dissolved}} salts or other contaminants) or surface water (which may have high turbidity or contain microorganisms) is pumped into a tank with an ultrafiltration membrane, which removes viruses and bacteria. This water is fit for cleaning and bathing. Ten {{percent of that}} water undergoes nanofiltration and reverse osmosis in {{the second stage of}} purification, which removes salts and <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants,</b> producing drinking water. A photovoltaic solar array tracks the Sun and powers the pumps needed to process the water, using the plentiful sunlight available in remote regions of Australia not served by the power grid.|$|E
40|$|<b>Trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> {{have become}} an {{increasing}} cause of concern for governments and water authorities {{as they attempt to}} respond to the potential challenges posed by climate change by implementing sustainable water cycle management practices. The augmentation of potable water supplies through indirect potable water reuse is one such method currently being employed. Given the uncertainty surrounding the potential human health impacts of prolonged ingestion of <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants,</b> it is vital that effective and sustainable treatment methods are utilized. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide a comprehensive literature review of the performance of the chemical coagulation process in removing <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> from water. This study evaluated the removal data collated from recent research relating to various <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> during the coagulation process. It was observed that there is limited research data relating to the removal of <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> using coagulation. The findings of this study suggest that there is a gap in the current research investigating the potential of new types of coagulants and exploring coagulation-based hybrid processes to remove <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> from water. The data analysed in this study regarding removal efficiency suggests that, even for the significantly hydrophobic compounds, hydrophobicity is not the sole factor governing removal of <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> by coagulation. This has important implications in that the usual practice of screening coagulants based on turbidity (suspended solid) removal proves inadequate in the case of <b>trace</b> organic <b>contaminant</b> removal...|$|R
40|$|Under a NASA-sponsored {{technology}} development project, a multi-disciplinary team consisting of industry, academia, and government organizations lead by Hamilton Sundstrand is developing an amine-based humidity and CO 2 removal process and prototype equipment for Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) applications. Originally this project sought to research enhanced amine formulations and incorporate a <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control capability into the sorbent. In October 2005, NASA re-directed the project team {{to accelerate the}} delivery of hardware by approximately one year and emphasize deployment on board the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) as the near-term developmental goal. Preliminary performance requirements were defined based on nominal and off-nominal conditions and the design effort was initiated using the baseline amine sorbent, SA 9 T. As {{part of the original}} project effort, basic sorbent development was continued with the University of Connecticut and dynamic equilibrium <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> adsorption characteristics were evaluated by NASA. This paper summarizes the University sorbent research effort, the basic <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> loading characteristics of the SA 9 T sorbent, design support testing, and the status of the full-scale system hardware design and manufacturing effort...|$|R

50|$|Rectisol is {{the trade}} name for an acid gas removal process that uses {{methanol}} as a solvent to separate acid gases such as hydrogen sulfide {{and carbon dioxide}} from valuable feed gas streams. By doing so, the feed gas is made more suitable for combustion and/or further processing. Rectisol is used most often to treat synthesis gas (primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide) produced by gasification of coal or heavy hydrocarbons, as the methanol solvent is well able to remove <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> such as ammonia, mercury, and hydrogen cyanide usually found in these gases. As an acid gas and large component of valuable feed gas streams, CO2 is separated during the methanol solvent regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Gas {{chromatography}} offered {{advantages in}} terms of size, cost, speed and sensitivity compared to the magnetic-sector mass spectrometry equipment most commonly used at that time. [...] Quadrupoles offered high sensitivity and high pressure tolerance. They could operate with a low voltage ion source. Rapid scanning became feasible because computers {{could be used to}} step the spectrometer from one ion peak to the next. This allowed acquisition and display of data in real-time, and gave operators the potential to interact with the system and modify what was being monitored. A major strength of the instrument was precise quantitation. It could be used to detect <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> in environmental samples, to identify drugs in a case of overdose, and to measure drug metabolites.|$|E
50|$|Purified {{water is}} water {{that has been}} {{mechanically}} filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use. Distilled water {{has been the most}} common form of purified water, but, in recent years, water is more frequently purified by other processes including capacitive deionization, reverse osmosis, carbon filtering, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodeionization. Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce water of such high purity that its <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). Purified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which has been treated ("rendered potable") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Trace</b> <b>Contaminant</b> Control Simulation {{computer}} {{program is a}} tool for assessing the performance of various <b>trace</b> <b>contaminant</b> control technologies for removing trace chemical contamination from a spacecraft cabin atmosphere.

5000|$|Subsequent {{epidemiological}} studies suggested that EMS {{was linked to}} specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought {{to be responsible for}} the 1989 EMS outbreak. While a total of 60 <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> were eventually identified, only 6 of them were associated with EMS. The compound EBT (1,1'-ethylidene-bis-L-tryptophan, also known as [...] "Peak E") was the only contaminant identifiable by initial analysis, but further analysis revealed PAA (3-(phenylamino)-L-alanine, also known as [...] "UV-5"), and peak 200 (23-indolyl-methyl-L-tryptophan). Two of the remaining uncharacterized peaks associated with EMS have been labeled [...] "UV-28" [...] and [...] "peak AAA", with peak AAA being [...] "the contaminant most significantly associated with EMS". The specific impurity or impurities responsible for the toxic effects was never firmly established. EBT has been frequently implicated as the culprit, but there is no statistically significant association between EBT levels and EMS.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{many experts}} who have {{evaluated}} the paper {{have concluded that}} the reported studies do not provide enough evidence to support the claims made by the authors. [...] In an online article on Slate, science writer Carl Zimmer discussed the skepticism of several scientists: [...] "I reached out to a dozen experts ... Almost unanimously, they think the NASA scientists have failed to make their case".Chemist Steven A. Benner has expressed doubts that arsenate has replaced phosphate in the DNA of this organism. He suggested that the <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the growth medium used by Wolfe-Simon in her laboratory cultures are sufficient to supply the phosphorus needed for the cells' DNA. He believes that {{it is more likely that}} arsenic is being sequestered elsewhere in the cells. [...] University of British Columbia microbiologist Rosemary Redfield said that the paper [...] "doesn't present any convincing evidence that arsenic has been incorporated into DNA or any other biological molecule", and suggests that the experiments lacked the washing steps and controls necessary to properly validate their conclusions. Harvard microbiologist Alex Bradley said that arsenic-containing DNA would be so unstable in water it could not have survived the analysis procedure.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} and fate of both {{organic and}} inorganic <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the aquatic environment {{has long been}} recognized as an important issue {{of public health and}} environmental concern. A wide range of trace organics, both synthetic and natural, have been detected and identified as important contaminants in sewage and effluent impacted water bodies including surface and groundwater. Trace inorganic contaminants can also occur naturally in groundwater under certain geochemical conditions. <b>Trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> are defined as chemicals of concern to human health and the biotic environment due to a combination of their physicochemical toxicological properties. In the aquatic environment, they are present at trace levels, usually in the μg/L range or less. From a toxicological point of view, low concentrations of <b>trace</b> <b>contaminants</b> in ground and drinking water may not always be harmful to humans (in fact in most cases health effects are unknown at this stage), but they are undesirable in regard to the “precautionary principle” [1]. Although trace contaminant removal is an issue facing various industries, this chapter focuses mostly on the water purification process.
