40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction that familiarity of words in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> {{for the second time}} in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time. One type of vowel in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in the words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the second time is smaller than that in words <b>that</b> <b>come</b> for the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R

5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion <b>that</b> <b>came</b> with the creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end}} of the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs.

5|$|Another major {{challenge}} <b>that</b> <b>came</b> up in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even {{someone who would}} give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{did little}} {{business}} in the transfer market {{early in the season}} due to the financial demands <b>that</b> <b>came</b> with the club's new stadium project. The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper Jens Lehmann for £1.5million; striker José Antonio Reyes was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain Patrick Vieira and midfielder Robert Pirès. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League title, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.|$|E
