5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} <b>table</b> <b>was</b> published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} sizes and styles of pool and billiard <b>tables.</b> Generally, <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{rectangles}} {{twice as long}} as they are wide. Most pool <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> 12 ft long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9 ft tables and cater to the serious pool player. Pubs will typically use 7 ft <b>tables</b> which <b>are</b> often coin-operated. Formerly, 10 ft <b>tables</b> <b>were</b> common, but such <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games.

5|$|However {{just before}} the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate {{announced}} that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water <b>table</b> <b>was</b> limited.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{chemistry}} professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic {{tables in}} 1869 and 1870, respectively. Mendeleev's <b>table</b> <b>was</b> his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded {{version of his}} (Meyer's) table of 1864. They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when {{the characteristics of the}} elements began to repeat.|$|E
5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer <b>table</b> <b>was</b> removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
50|$|A <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a {{homogeneous}} collection of records, where each record {{has the same}} set of columns. Each <b>table</b> <b>is</b> identified by a table name, whose scope is local to the database in which the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> contained. The amount of disk space allocated to a table within a database is determined by a parameter given when the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> created with the CreateTable operation.

5000|$|The {{relation}} of the central table {{to those in the}} dimension <b>tables</b> <b>is</b> one-to-many or in some cases many-to-many rather than many-to-one; the primary keys of the central <b>table</b> <b>are</b> the foreign keys in dimension tables, and the main <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> in general, smaller than the dimension tables.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the new location, new touches {{were made to the}} service. If a female diner had a handbag, a small side <b>table</b> <b>was</b> placed beside her so that she did not need to place the bag on the floor. Money was not reused; change was only given in new notes and previously unused coins. The kitchen staff were expanded further to around 25, with Robert Reid as the head chef under White. The front of house staff were also expanded to six sommeliers, four Maître d'hôtels and two head waiters. In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 1942, seeking {{reprisal}} {{for their}} great loss and also retaliation against retreating {{soldiers from the}} 44th Indian Brigade who had fired from Alexandra Hospital, 3 groups of Japanese soldiers went on a blind rampage and entered the hospital from the rear bayoneting everyone they found, {{regardless of whether they}} were soldiers, patients and medical staff. They killed a British officer, Lieutenant W.E.J. Weston, who was carrying a white flag to meet them. Even a young patient, Corporal Holden, who was lying on an operating <b>table</b> <b>was</b> not spared. About 200 defenceless souls were massacred. Some managed to escape death by falling to the floor and pretending to be dead.|$|E
5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, the <b>table</b> <b>was</b> set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E

5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the <b>table,</b> <b>was</b> punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of atomic numbers {{to the organization}} of the periodic <b>table</b> <b>was</b> not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence of atomic numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E
5|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire Control <b>Table</b> <b>was</b> one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner <b>table</b> <b>was</b> the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's <b>table</b> <b>was</b> in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E
