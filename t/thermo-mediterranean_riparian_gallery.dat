Surveys at different space and time scales were carried out using standardised point count methods, on 8 watercourses in Portugal and France. We focused on different aspects of riparian breeding bird community variation: along a decreasing gradient of vegetal complexity (Tagus Basin), along an upstream-downstream gradient (Allier), with different surrounding landscapes (Sado, Guadiana and Tagus Basin), with time (Alcáçovas at a 10 years interval, Allier at 16 years interval), with management status (Vidourle), with time & management status (Rhône delta at a 12 years intervals), before & after river rehabilitation (Gandum). In addition we studied the dispersal of Barn Owls from upper Tagus Estuary along riparian corridors (TytoTagus Project), and also the importance of riparian habitats of the Guadiana basin on the autumn migration of trans-Saharan birds across the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|Rehabilitation {{of woody}} <b>riparian</b> <b>galleries</b> largely {{depends on the}} {{availability}} of seedlings or seeds of autochthonous species, which are usually difficult to obtain in Portugal. The cultural value of autochthonous seeds of several riparian woody species in nursery conditions was evaluated in order to assess seedling production feasibility. The choice of species was based on their occurrence in riparian habitats, even if not exclusive to such environments, and their suitability to establishment studies currently under way. The results indicate that seeds of Celtis australis, Fraxinus angustifolia, Quercus robur, Q. faginea and Platanus × hybrida obtained in Portugal were highly suited to seedling production. Germination of seeds of Acer pseudoplatanus and A. campestre was much more irregular and seeds from Alnus glutinosaand Crataegus monogyna exhibited a very low germination rate. We conclude that seedling production of European hackberry, oaks, narrow-leaved ash, and plane tree and, less clearly, maples, can be successfully carried out in nursery conditions using simple and unsophisticated sowing techniques. For common alder and whitethorn it is preferable to produce seedlings via vegetative propagation as an alternative to more sophisticated nursery pre-germination treatments...|$|R

Retrogradational coastal salt marsh facies associations contain abundant charred conifer wood (families Cheirolepidiaceae and Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae) derived from fires in halophytic backswamp forest, and rare pinaceous charred cones and lauraceous angiosperm wood washed downstream from fires further inland (Units 3 – 4). Progradational coastal facies associations within an estuary mouth setting contain abundant charred conifer wood (family Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae), common taxodiaceous conifer and angiosperm leaves, fern rachises, and lycopsid stems derived from fires in mesic backswamp taxodiaceous forests and supra-tidal fern-lycopsid thickets (Unit 5). Growth rings in angiosperm and conifer woods, leaf physiognomy and computer models indicate that climate was equable, warm and humid, {{but that there}} was a short annual dry season; most fires probably occurred during these annual drought periods.

Though bats {{are one of the}} most threatened groups of European vertebrates, studies aiming to quantify bat mortality and determine the main factors driving it remain scarce. Between March 16 and October 31 of 2009, we surveyed road-killed bats daily along a 51 -km-long transect that incorporates different types of roads in southern Portugal. We found 154 road-killed bats of 11 species. The two most common species in the study area, Pipistrellus kuhlii and P. pygmaeus, were also the most commonly identified road-kill, representing 72 % of the total specimens collected. About two-thirds of the total mortality occurred between mid July and late September, peaking in the second half of August. We also recorded casualties of threatened and rare species, including Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, Barbastella barbastellus, and Nyctalus leisleri. These species were found mostly in early autumn, corresponding to the mating and swarming periods. Landscape features were the most important variable subset for explaining bat casualties. Road stretches crossing or in the vicinity of high-quality habitats for bats—including dense Mediterranean woodland (‘‘montado’’) areas, water courses with <b>riparian</b> <b>gallery,</b> and water reservoirs—yielded a significantly higher number of casualties. Additionally, more roadkilled bats were recorded on high-traffic road stretches with viaducts, in areas of higher bat activity and near known roosts...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to follow the extent of forest types during the Palaeocene and Eocene {{in time and space}} over Europe. Problems that hinder {{producing}} more detailed maps of potential Eocene vegetation are the different palaeogeographic configuration of land and sea and changing relief due to orogeny, the variation in global climate, atmospheric circulation and the world ocean. The early Palaeogene palaeofloristic sites in Europe are widely spaced and the data so far obtained are of varying quality from one site to another. The differences between zonal, intrazonal (azonal) and extrazonal formations and impact of precipitation must be considered. Objective definitions of units based on diversity percentages of components are still to be elaborated. The macropalaeobotanical data thus far available allow us to distinguish intuitively three zonal vegetation types: 1) Broad-leaved evergreen/semi-evergreen quasi-paratropical forest with a high diversity of woody angiosperms related to tropical families, ferns and a low diversity of conifers (mostly Doliostrobus), 2) Broad-leaved nothophyllous evergreen forest with evergreen Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Altingiaceae, Myrtaceae and some conifers (Pinus, Doliostrobus, Cephalotaxus) and 3) Polar deciduous to mixed mesophytic forest with well diversified angiosperms predominantly deciduous and moderate representation of Ginkgo, conifers and ferns. Intrazonal (azonal) formations include <b>riparian</b> <b>gallery</b> forests, coal-forming swamp forests, and poorly developed mangroves with marginal freshwater wetland/aquatic vegetation.

40|$|Throughout {{the southwestern}} U. S., <b>riparian</b> <b>gallery</b> forests of cottonwood and willow are being invaded by woody exotics, {{primarily}} Russian olive and salt cedar. We wondered what effect {{this might have}} on native pollinator populations. Pollinators are indispensable contributors to biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human food production. Recent declines in pollinator abundance and health, such as catastrophic declines in honey bee populations due to Colony Collapse Disorder, has renewed interest in native pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide. Insects were collected from willow, Russian olive and salt cedar throughout April and May of 1997 and 1998 using sweep nets. For each collection day, nets were swept over the target shrubs for a specified number for passes to ensure equal collection effort. Insects were counted and identified to family. Total numbers were adjusted by number of sweep-days. Total insect abundance was greatest for willows (33. 5 insects per sweep-day), followed by Russian olive (18. 0) and salt cedar (6. 8). Willows also had {{the greatest number of}} insect orders and families represented. Of the four primary insect pollinator orders, willow had the greatest numbers of dipterans, hymenopterans, and lepidopterans collected per sweep-day. Russian olive had the greatest number of coleopterans. When ants and chalcids were excluded from the hymenopterans, willows still had the greatest numbers and proportions of hymenopterans caught. It appears that the willow habitat is important to pollinating insects, especially bees. In contrast, saltcedar consistently had the lowest numbers and proportions of all four of the pollinator orders...|$|R

Linear structures {{may contribute to the}} conservation of biodiversity by providing additional habitats for smallfauna living in highly modiﬁed environments. We assessed the importance of road verges as refuge areas for small mammals, in highly intensiﬁed grazed pastures, within a Mediterranean landscape and compared the role of road verges as refuges with that of <b>riparian</b> <b>galleries,</b> which have been described as important shelter locations for small fauna. For this purpose, a small mammal trapping study was undertaken on two road verges and beside two small streams in southern Portugal. We captured 457 individuals of ﬁve diﬀerent species, with Mus spretus the most common species captured, followed by Crocidura russula. Captures were 4. 6 -fold higher immediately beside both roads and streams than 12 m away in the surrounding matrix. Individuals captured in the matrix presented a smaller body size and lower body condition, suggesting that this suboptimal habitat is occupied mainly by subadults. M. spretus was 46 % more abundant by roads than by streams, while C. russula was present in similar numbers in both habitats. M. spretus individuals were larger near streams but exhibited no diﬀerence in body condition between habitats. C. russula had a better body condition and slightly higher body lengths at roadsides. Our results show that roadside verges in intensively grazed Mediterranean landscapes act as important refuges and constitute equally vital habitats for small mammals as do riparian vegetation strips in landscapes where other suitable habitats are scarce...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Loss of {{riparian}} habitat {{along the}} Middle Sacramento River, {{over the last}} 100 years, has reduced a once contiguous riparian forest {{to a series of}} disjunct remnants of varying size and quality. With limited financial resources to purchase and protect some of the remaining riparian plant communities, it has become necessary to develop methods to select which of the remaining habitats are to become protected. A site evaluation method was developed that included vegetation quality, type and rarity, size, viability, unique features, rare plants, shape, and potential for growth. Using this method 240 plant community sites that included 5 plant community types were evaluated and ranked. The evaluation method and the results are outlined and a critique of the method discussed in light of long term riparian nature preserve design. The loss of riparian vegetation and habitats in California has resulted in the need for an immediate coordinated effort by government agencies and private organizations to develop a plan to preserve what little remains. However, the cost of preservation, in conjunction with the unwillingness of some riparian land owners to sell, restricts the amounts and locations of land that can be acquired. In order to develop a strategy for the preservation of the remaining riparian habitats in California three pieces of information are needed: 1) location and types of remaining riparian vegetation, 2) the quality of individual contiguous riparian areas and 3) a preserve plan for which areas should be acquired. The middle Sacramento River, between Keswick Dam and Verona, is a riparian corridor 167 kilometers long. The combined impacts from agriculture, levee building and bank stabilization (rip-rap) has reduced this once contiguous <b>riparian</b> <b>gallery</b> forest to a series of disjunct riparian islands.

40|$|During {{the period}} 2008 - 2009, there were 2 {{contracts}} with BPA. One (38539) {{was dealing with}} the restoration work for 2007 and the other (26198) was an extension on the 2006 contract including the NEPA for Dam removal on the old channel of the Sandy River. For contract 38539, the Sandy River Delta Habitat Restoration project continued its focus on riparian hardwood reforestation with less emphasis on wetlands restoration. Emphasis was placed on Sundial Island again due to the potential removal of the dike {{and the loss of}} access in the near future. AshCreek Forest Management was able to leverage additional funding from grants to help finance the restoration effort; this required a mid year revision of work funded by BPA. The revised work not only continued the maintenance of restored hardwood forests, but was aimed to commence the restoration of the Columbia River Banks, an area all along the Columbia River. This would be the final restoration for Sundial Island. The grant funding would help achieve this. Thus by 2011, all major work will have been completed on Sundial Island and the need for access with vehicles would no longer be required. The restored forests continued to show excellent growth and development towards true <b>riparian</b> <b>gallery</b> forests. Final inter-planting was commenced, and will continue through 2010 before the area is considered fully restored. No new wetland work was completed. The wetlands were filled by pumping in early summer to augment the water levels but due to better rainfall, no new fuel was required to augment existing. Monitoring results continued to show very good growth of the trees and the restoration at large was performing beyond expectations. Weed problems continue to be the most difficult issue. The $ 100, 000 from BPA planned for forest restoration in 2008, was augmented by $ 25, 000 from USFS, $ 120, 000 from OR 150 grant, $ 18, 000 from LCREP, and the COE continued to add $ 250, 000 for their portion. Summary of the use of these funds are displayed in Table 1 (page 5). Work on the restoration of the original Sandy River channel (dam removal, contract 26198) continued slowly.

Location: Tajikistan. Methods: Altogether 201 relevés were sampled between 2008 - 2013 using the seven-degree cover-abundance scale of Braun-Blanquet. They were classified by the modified TWINSPAN method using the four-step interval scale with cutoff levels of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 % and total inertia {{as a measure of}} cluster heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrendended Correspondence Analysis was used to determine the relation between samples, vegetation units and the major gradients in species composition. Results: Plant communities of typical broad-leaved, <b>riparian</b> and <b>gallery</b> woods inhabiting mainly the lowland, colline, montane and subalpine zone in several mountains and river valleys in the Pamir Alai Mts. are herein described. Numerical analyses of vegetation data resulted in the distinction of ten associations: Juglandetum regiae, Aceretum turkestanici, Violo suavis-Populetum albae, Swido darvasicae-Platanetum orientalis, Populetum pamiricae, Populetum talassicae, Salicetum turanico-pycnostachyae, Populetum pruinosae, Betuletum turkestanico-tianschanicae and Fraxinetum sogdianae, which have been assigned to four alliances: Acero turkestanici-Juglandion regiae for mesophilous broad-leaved forests, Populion afghanicae for montane riparian forests, Populion talassicae for subalpine riparian forests and Elaeagno-Populion pruinosae for gallery forests of the Middle Asian lowlands. The main factors determining the species composition of the studied associations are salinity, soil humidity, elevation, slope and aspect.

Habitat fragmentation is a process generally regarded as comprising three major components: reduction in total area, increase in isolation, and reduction in average size of patches of remnant natural vegetation.

Although several studies demonstrated the negative impact of habitat fragmentation, few focused in carnivore species, and particularly in Mediterranean environments. Carnivores’ position {{in the top of the}} food webs and their vulnerability to different human activities make this group especially significant in conservation and management actions. Our goal in this study was to assess the influence of human-related variables on the carnivore’s probability of occurrence, according to habitat patch size and isolation, and road network characteristics. Stone marten Martes foina was selected as the model species to investigate the response to cork oak woodland fragmentation, considering that forest dependent species would show a stronger response. Marten species are known to be sensitive to forest fragmentation, although there is some evidence that their response is mainly determined by the level of forest fragmentation and the matrix quality, due to their preference for structurally complex forests to avoid competition and increase den availability. We compared the stone marten response to scent stations located in four large and continuous forest patches (mean 36000 ha, 19 sampling sites) and in 25 smaller and isolated forest patches (mean 2. 67 ha, one sampling site). For each sampling site a variable number of scent stations was used (average= 11, min= 7, max= 17) depending on the patch size. Using the software PRESENCE we developed models that best fit stone marten probability of presence. This method parallels a closed-population mark–recapture model with an additional parameter (Phi) that represents the probability of species presence. Also, it enables the introduction of covariate information using a logistic model for Phi. Nine human and road related variables were used to develop models that best fit stone marten probability of occurrence in the smaller and isolated patches. The best models were selected using the Aikaike Information Criteria. Each variable importance was assessed by summing the AIC model weights (w) in which it was included. A data set of eighty stone marten road-kill locations and of eighty points randomly distributed along the sampled roads was used to evaluate if there were significant differences (one factor ANOVA), regarding the models’ most important variables on the road casualties locations. Results suggest that the probability of presence of stone marten in larger and continuous patches was 90 %, while for the smaller and isolated patches it decreases to 60 %. Nine significant models were retained. Models evidenced that the probability of presence of stone marten in isolated patches is related to cork oak density (+) (w= 0. 73), distance to nearest patch (-) (w= 0. 67), distance to nearest large patch (-) (w= 0. 56), distance to roads with medium/higher traffic volume (+) (w= 0. 37), and distance to <b>riparian</b> <b>galleries</b> (-) (w= 0. 12). Moreover, we detected that road kills were also significantly related to higher forest area surrounding the road (F= 7. 37, d. f. = 1, P< 0. 01) and also to the proximity of nearest forest patch (F= 8. 80, d. f. = 1, P< 0. 01). According to these findings, stone marten seems to be negatively affected by habitat fragmentation being essential to promote good land management practices to guarantee a minimum area availability and well connected habitat patches through the establishment of suitable corridors for species movements. Furthermore, in road stretches close to cork oak patches, mitigation measures as wildlife passages ought to be considered in order to diminish the mortality rates. One should be aware that other forest dependent carnivores as genets Genetta genetta and wild cats Felis silvestris, the later of higher conservation concern and with decreasing density in the Iberian Peninsula, may respond stronger to habitat fragmentation than stone marten. This means that smaller and isolated habitat patches may become unoccupied, leading to species disappearance, being therefore highlighted the need to incorporate these findings in conservation action plans...|$|R
