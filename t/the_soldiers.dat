5|$|A Slovene {{account of}} the same event asserts that <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> began to fire only when an Austrian citizen {{discharged}} a revolver {{in the direction of}} the Slovene soldiers, striking the bayonet of one. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> then returned fire: according to this account 11 were killed, and an unknown number wounded.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted six of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> after two and {{one-half}} hours' deliberation. Two of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{were found guilty}} of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While {{on the way to}} hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E
50|$|Veresina occidentalis {{can be used}} in {{the home}} garden for insect control. Verbesina occidentalis attracts <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle is also yellow and can hide among <b>the</b> flowers. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle will also drink the nectar from the plant. When <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle drinks <b>the</b> nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle will prey on other insects. <b>The</b> adult <b>soldier</b> beetles will eat the aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs and mites. The larva of <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle hatches in the spring. <b>The</b> larva <b>soldier</b> beetles prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> beetle lays its eggs in the late summer.|$|R

50|$|An Army company {{commander}} threatened a soldier with involuntary {{separation from the}} Army and disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>soldier’s</b> active duty extension in reprisal for <b>the</b> <b>soldier’s</b> protected communication. <b>The</b> <b>soldier</b> had complained to an IG about the commander’s abuse of authority.

5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> now surrounding the city. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures.

5|$|Equipped with ladders, ropes, {{weapons and}} ammunition, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> managed {{to obtain the}} keys of the Battant through a man named Le Goux, after {{threatening}} civil law notary Jean Papay. After crossing the Battant Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> entered the city and prepared to attack {{with the help of}} two townspeople; one named Recy, and the other an upholsterer named Augustin. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> seized armaments located near the Battant, with the intention of sacking the archdiocese and churches, and killing Catholic priests and church leaders. The invaders then separated into groups: some gathered around the Battant, while about 70 men, on horse and foot, reached the high street; those who were approaching the Battant passed along the Rue des Granges, a major street in Besançon. Both groups were assisted by many townspeople. By this time, the Protestant invaders had destroyed several houses (such as that of Madame de Thoraise of Chavirey), and an attack on the town hall wounded one Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any {{evidence}} of a fort in the area, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg.

5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built.

5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> but the speculators that had bought the bonds from <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> who had shown little faith in the country's future.

5|$|In 1776, Indians at the Bahia {{missions}} told <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{that the}} Karankawas had massacred {{a group of}} Europeans who had been shipwrecked {{near the mouth of}} the Guadalupe River.

Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the barrier islands and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, declined to give permission for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.|$|E
5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor.

At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot.|$|E
