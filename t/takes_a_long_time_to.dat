5|$|The {{wood turtle}} <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach sexual maturity, {{has a low}} {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks {{in the spring and}} again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

25|$|Casual {{matchmaking}} allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be randomly matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this search range if it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this matchmaking approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option was meant for players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2013 {{survey of}} Vaughan Williams's stage works, Eric Saylor writes, [...] "With the {{possible}} exception of Tchaikovsky, no composer's operatic career was less emblematic of his success elsewhere." [...] Although Vaughan Williams was a regular opera-goer, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about works by operatic masters from Mozart to Wagner and Verdi, his success in the operatic field was at best patchy. There is widespread agreement among commentators that this was partly due to the composer's poor choice of librettists for some, though not all, of his operas. Another problem was his keenness to encourage amateurs and student groups, which sometimes led to the staging of his operas with less than professional standards. A further factor was the composer's expressed preference for [...] "slow, long tableaux", which tended to reduce dramatic impact, although he believed them essential, as [...] "music <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> speak—much longer than words by themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative. This {{is just a}} bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E

The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric [...] with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this [...] "old" [...] water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation). This effect is not uniform– the average effect is about 440 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other. The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.|$|E

In the fourth and fifth instalments, Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, despite mounting evidence. The Ministry even mounts a campaign to damage Harry Potter's credibility, an effort fuelled in part by Fudge's self inflicted persecutory delusions and paranoid fear that Albus Dumbledore wants to forcibly remove him from his position. This accusation holds no evidence. After seeing Voldemort with their own eyes, the Ministry is forced to acknowledge the emergency and act on it. Fudge is subsequently removed from office for incompetence and replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour.|$|E

Brent Budowsky reviewed the book for The Hill and praised it, writing: [...] "Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year."
