500|$|Kenesaw Mountain Landis {{was born}} in Millville, Ohio, the sixth child and fourth son of Abraham Hoch Landis, a physician, and Mary Kumler Landis, on November 20, 1866. The Landises descended from Swiss Mennonites who had emigrated to Alsace {{before coming to the}} United States. Abraham Landis had been wounded {{fighting}} on the Union side at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia, and when his parents proved unable to agree on a name for the new baby, Mary Landis proposed that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Kenesaw Mountain. At the time, both spellings of [...] "Kenesaw" [...] were used, but in the course of time, [...] "Kennesaw Mountain" [...] became the accepted spelling of the battle site.|$|E
500|$|Bret Hart's {{feud with}} Bob Backlund dated {{back to the}} July 30, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Backlund {{believed}} that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped {{him in the face}} and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Mr. Backlund" [...] and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing off of this, a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the other person throw in a towel. Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is broken}} up into two episodes: [...] "Secret of the Oracle" [...] and [...] "The Armageddon Machine". In the first episode, having {{defeated}} the Grand Intellect in Invasion of the Vorticons and saved the Earth, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze {{is building a}} faster-than-light communications radio. Upon completing it, he hears a transmission announcing that a race of aliens known as the Shikadi are planning to destroy the galaxy. Donning his helmet as Commander Keen, he takes off in his spaceship—first stunning his parents with his neural stunner gun as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> in to dinner—for the planet of Gnosticus IV, home of the Oracle and the Gnosticenes that tend it, {{to find out who}} the Shikadi are and how they plan to destroy the galaxy. Upon arriving, he is met by a Council Page, who tells him that the council of immortal Gnosticenes have been kidnapped by the Shikadi and taken [...] "to the Shadowlands far to the west", leaving monsters and traps to guard them. Keen journeys through the outposts and temples of the Shadowlands, rescuing all of the Gnosticenes, and afterwards they turn on the Oracle machine. The Oracle tells Keen that the Shikadi are [...] "shadow beings from {{the far side of the}} galaxy" [...] who are building an Armageddon Machine at Korath III to blow up the galaxy and rebuild it as they wish afterwards. As the episode ends, Keen sets off to stop them.|$|E

However, most of the office does {{not want him to}} work there due to his previous behavior, and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in particular is horrified at the idea. Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) gives him a job as a salesman, forcing Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to leave his desk and move to the annex. Todd repeatedly offends everybody with his jokes, especially Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), although Kevin pretends to play along. Only Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Packer's longtime friend, is not offended by Todd. Holly, who was at first excited to have Todd in the office per Michael's recommendations, discovers how insensitive Todd is and asks Michael to get him under control. Michael and Todd have coffee in the lobby, where Todd says {{he wants to be a}} better person. Michael gets Todd to apologize, but everyone can tell that the apologies are insincere. Dwight and Jim scheme to get rid of Todd. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>him,</b> pretending to be corporate offering him a job in Tallahassee, Florida, a job which Todd readily accepts. Michael overhears the call and goes to tell Todd that Dwight and Jim have tricked him. Before he has a chance, however, Todd insults Holly, and Michael decides to keep Dwight and Jim's scheme a secret and allow Todd to take the [...] "job" [...] in Florida. As Michael and Holly witness Todd drive away from the view in his office, Michael admits that Packer is [...] "an ass" [...] before they embrace.|$|E

2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his back on him. Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. I hit him with some big ones but he kept coming and I can see why <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> the 'Hitman'." [...] The fight received large amounts of publicity, with both fighters promoting the fight heavily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day began}} well, {{and the weather}} was {{pleasant}} and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked {{the part of a}} top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and swinging deliveries and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision made things worse for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: [...] ""Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a batsman's umpire?" [...] and some others said, [...] "Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger." [...] But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in The Australian, commented that, [...] "World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful fellow, was a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he is slipping and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance." [...] Rajan Bala also wrote in the Asian Age:"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian." [...] In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: [...] "Give him out now." [...] The comment was noted to be quite sarcastic in nature.|$|E
