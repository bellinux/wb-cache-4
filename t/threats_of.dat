40|$|This study investigates how the ex-ante <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> {{termination}} affects firm {{performance in}} innovation measured by number of patents and citations. Empirical {{results show that}} the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> termination is negatively associated with both measures of firm innovation. This relation however is sensitive to industry structure. The negative effect <b>of</b> the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> termination on innovation is statistically significant only for high-tech firms. For low-tech firms there is no statistically significant relation between the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> termination and firm innovation. One plausible explanation is that high-tech firms are inherently risky and have higher rates of project failure. Adding the risk <b>of</b> higher <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> termination makes the manager more risk averse and forces her to avoid investing in value increasing innovations. Managers in low-tech firms don’t face such pressures. The policy implication is that high-tech firms should lower <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> termination and increase tolerance for project failure to encourage innovation...|$|R

Adaptation was conceptualized as relearning after a change in task execution rules. <b>Threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss was manipulated for 100 participants undertaking an air traffic control task.

The results showed that individuals who experienced the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss had a stronger drop in performance (less transition adaptation) and a subsequent slower recovery (less reacquisition adaptation) compared with the control group who experienced no threat. Emotion control (but not task focus) moderated {{the relationship between the}} <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> resource loss and transition adaptation. In this respect, individuals who felt threatened but regulated their emotions performed better immediately after the task change (but not later on) compared with those individuals who felt threatened and did not regulate their emotions as well.

40|$|The study {{centers on}} the power of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) as {{predictors}} of prejudice against stereotypical and nonstereotypical homosexuals under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty. Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is an individual difference variable that measures the tendency for individuals to unquestionably follow those perceived to be authorities. Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) is an individual difference variable that measures the degree to which an individual prefers inequality among social groups. The RWA and SDO Scales are considered to be two of the strongest predictors of prejudice, such as prejudice against homosexuals. The study focuses on the unique predictive power of these two variables in predicting prejudice against homosexuals. The study also examines the role <b>of</b> situational <b>threat</b> in prejudice, specifically the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death (mortality salience) and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty (uncertainty salience). Competing predictions from theories involving the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death (Terror Management Theory) and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty (Uncertainty Management Theory) are also tested. The preference for expected information in the form of stereotypes concerning male homosexuals (that is, a stereotypical or non-stereotypical homosexual) were tested. The difference between the predictive power ofRWA and SDO was examined by measuring how these variables predict liking of a stereotypical or non-stereotypical homosexual under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death, the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, or a control condition. Along with completing a measure for RWA and a measure for SDO, participants were asked to think of their own death, of their being uncertain or about watching television then were asked to read about a week in the life of either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical male homosexual. Participants were then asked to evaluate the individual and his essay. Based on the participants' evaluations, results from 180 heterosexual university students show that RWA and SDO are strong predictors for disliking of a stereotypical homosexual under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and disliking of a non-stereotypical homosexual under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death. Furthermore, however, results show that RWA is a particularly strong predictor of disliking of a stereotypical homosexual under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, whereas SDO is an exceptionally strong predictor of disliking of the non-stereotypical homosexual under the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> death. This further adds to the notion that RWA and SDO are indeed unique predictors of prejudice. Implications are also explored, including the fact that the study simuhaneously examined the role of individual difference variables and situational threat variables, as well as exploratory analysis on Dominating Authoritarians...|$|R
