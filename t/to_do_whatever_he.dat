5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and resolved <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

In one instance, a professor organized a dinner with both African-American and European-American families. He asked the African-American guests, who arrived first, to sit in every other chair, so that when the European American guests arrived they would be forced to interact with one another. The professor knew he couldn't force people to give up their prejudice, but <b>he</b> was committed <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> could <b>to</b> encourage tolerance.|$|R

25|$|A gate to Earth is opened, which Kyle passes through, {{causing the}} Kha'ak to {{discover}} it. They {{try to go}} through it and fight a combined Teladi, Boron and Argon fleet led by Ban Danna, inflicting large casualties. Julian and Ion try to stabilise the gate with the Teladi station, which sends them both through it, killing Ion. Julian survives and finds himself floating at a gate near Earth, with a massive fleet moving towards him. It is the Terran fleet, and with Kyle and Julian on board it passes through the jump hole and helps the overwhelmed defenders against the Kha'ak. The Terrans afterwards distrust towards the X Universe races, even the Argon humans, prompting Kyle to return to Earth to try to correct the situation. Julian is released, pardoned of his crimes by the Argon Federation and the Paranid Empire, and the player is left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants in the post-plot universe.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle means nothing to him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> likes, implying he wants an open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch might have left town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E
500|$|... "Diggy Down" [...] {{was written}} by Ilsey Juber, Marcel Botezan, Radu Bolfea and Sebastian Barac, while being solely {{produced}} by Vlad Lucan. It samples elements from Marian Hill's recording [...] "Got It" [...] (2014), for which the band is credited as a featured artist. The single is a mid-tempo dance-pop recording incorporating R influences into its sound. According to music website Direct Lyrics's Kevin Apaza, the track lyrically portrays Inna [...] " [...] the way her boy moves and [...] him she is 'diggy diggy down' <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants". Apaza went on noting similarities between the track's saxophone sequences and Jason Derulo's work.|$|E

General Anami refused to say whether he would help the young officers in treason. As much as they needed his support, Hatanaka and the other rebels decided they {{had no choice but to}} continue planning and to attempt a coup d'état on their own. Hatanaka spent much of August 13 and the morning of August 14 gathering allies, seeking support from the higher-ups in the Ministry, and perfecting his plot.|$|E

He saw an opponent's {{weakness}} in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like." [...] The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain [...] "without a superior anywhere today". Wisden thought him, [...] "with the exception of ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country." [...] The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, [...] " [...] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles." [...] Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, [...] "I like a captain to have a settled plan, [...] just seemed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> thought of at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom MacRae, {{the writer}} of the episode, had {{previously}} written the two-parter [...] "Rise of the Cybermen"/"The Age of Steel" [...] for the second series, which featured {{the return of the}} Cybermen. As bringing back the Cybermen had limited plot opportunities and put MacRae in the [...] "second seat" [...] as a writer, he was pleased that he had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wanted. MacRae was proud of the finished script, calling it his [...] "most accomplished piece of plotting ever". The original title of the episode was [...] "The Visitors' Room". This was changed to [...] "Visiting Hour" [...] and then [...] "Kindness". The episode, contrary to some reports, was never at any point titled [...] "The Green Anchor". [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] is a title that has been used to refer to Amy after she waited 12 years for the Doctor to return in [...] "The Eleventh Hour".

500|$|Released in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album 13 {{saw them}} drift still {{further away from}} their Britpop-era {{attitude}} and sound. Orbit's production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a [...] "variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds" [...] into the mix. 13 was creatively dominated by Coxon, who [...] "was simply allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> chose, unedited", by Orbit. Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years. The album received generally favourable reviews from the press. While Q called it [...] "a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album", the NME felt it was inconsistent and [...] "(at least) a quarter-of-an-hour too long". 13 debuted {{at the top of}} the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album's lead single, the gospel-based [...] "Tender", opened at the second spot on the charts. After [...] "Coffee & TV", the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.|$|E
500|$|When Monkey Punch began Lupin III, he {{was already}} working on another series, Pinky Punky. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both Lupin III and Pinky Punky made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this {{made it easy for}} him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as Columbo and Agatha Christie novels, and was also {{inspired}} by The Three Musketeers and the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and describes them as [...] "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other". Another influence on the manga was Mad magazine. Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.|$|E
500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of Cyberculture {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Various {{philosophical}} influences can {{be found}} in [...] "Bartleby the Scrivener". [...] The story alludes to Jonathan Edwards's [...] "Inquiry into the Freedom of the Will"; and Jay Leyda, in his introduction to The Complete Stories of Herman Melville, comments on the similarities between Bartleby and The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity by Joseph Priestley. [...] Both Edwards and Priestley wrote about free will and determinism. [...] Edwards states that free will requires the will to be isolated from the moment of decision. [...] Bartleby's isolation from the world allows him to be completely free. [...] He has the ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> pleases. [...] The reference to Priestley and Edwards in connection with determinism may suggest that Bartleby's exceptional exercise of his personal will, even though it leads to his death, spares him from an externally determined fate.|$|E
