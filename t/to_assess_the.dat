As a result of research, based on the analysis of scientific literature, the most applicable methodological approaches <b>to</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> development of enterprises are characterized. 8 methodical approaches <b>to</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> level of development of enterprises and 4 methodological approaches <b>to</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> level of development of clusters are singled out. Each of the approaches {{is characterized by the}} presence of certain advantages and disadvantages, but none of them allows to obtain a systematic assessment of all areas of cluster functioning, identify possible reserves for cluster competitiveness growth and characterize possible strategies for their future development. Taking into account peculiarities of the functioning and development of cluster associations of enterprises, we propose our own methodological approach for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> development of innovative cluster structures...|$|R
