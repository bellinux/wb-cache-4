5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enforced</b> seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} threat of invasion {{led to a}} major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths. Due to the increased need for manpower, the restrictions which prohibited non-Europeans from joining the military ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enforced</b> from late 1941, and about 3000 Indigenous Australians eventually enlisted. Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations, but a small number of racially segregated units such as the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion were formed. A number of small units made up of Indigenous Australians were also established to patrol northern Australia and harass any Japanese forces which landed there; the members of these units did not receive pay or awards for their service until 1992. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain the expanded military after the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 while only 53 of the 73RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised.|$|E

25|$|Finally, it was {{traditionally}} {{thought that}} arbitration clauses could not displace any employment rights, and therefore limit {{access to justice}} in public courts. However, in 14 Penn Plaza LLC v.

The four dissenting judges argued that this would eliminate rights {{in a way that}} the law never intended.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, draft {{legislation}} was proposed to prohibit {{the consumption of}} dog meat. The legislation, however, was not expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enforced,</b> despite making the consumption of dog meat illegal if it passed. In 2010, the first draft proposal of the legislation was introduced, with the rationale to protect animals from maltreatment. The legislation includes a measure to jail people for up to 15 days for eating dog meat. However, certain cultural food festivals continue to promote the meat. For example, in 2014, 10,000 dogs were killed for the Yulin dog eating festival.|$|E
25|$|Some Canadian Members of Parliament saw the {{movement}} to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy. Others {{would say that the}} European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998, which allows the ECHR <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enforced</b> directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.|$|E

Pre-code sex films explored woman's issues, challenged the concept of marriage, and aggressive sexuality was the norm. The sexual subject matter of the uncensored period was found within many movie genres, most especially in dramas, crime films, exotic-adventure films, comedies and musicals.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, I cannot {{find in the}} Canadian Bill of Rights {{anything}} clearly {{showing that}} Parliament intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enforced</b> by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the time. In my opinion, Parliament did nothing more than instruct the courts to construe and apply those laws {{in accordance with the}} principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.|$|E
