5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{decommissioned}} after the war, São Paulo on 2 August 1947 and Minas Geraes on 31 December 1952. The former {{was sold to}} a British shipbreaker and was towed out of Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951. When north of the Azores in a strong storm, the <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> snapped. Though multiple searches were mounted by American and British aircraft, the ship was never found. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian company in 1953 and towed to Genoa from 11 March 1954 to 22 April.|$|E
5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow the bow section of the ship out to sea failed when the <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a <b>tow</b> <b>line.</b> Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 December, the <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> of Aiviq and Nanuq parted again, and Kulluk began {{drifting}} {{towards the}} coast. Another tugboat, the 10,000-horsepower Alert operated by Crowley Marine Services, also arrived {{to the scene}} from Prince William Sound. Shortly after midnight, Alert was able to secure connection to the [...] <b>towing</b> <b>line</b> previously used by Aiviq {{and later in the}} morning the icebreaker had also reconnected to Kulluk about [...] southeast from Kodiak Island. USCGC Alex Haley also returned to the scene from Kodiak, where the cutter had repaired her fouled port propeller, and relieved the crew of USCGC Spar as on scene commander. The helicopter crews were also preparing to deploy several technicians aboard the drilling rig to evaluate the condition of the <b>towing</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E
5|$|In March 1917, Enns {{relocated}} to Brăila in eastern Romania, where it remained until July 1918. Sent to Linz and Budapest for an overhaul in dry dock, Enns {{then returned to}} eastern Romania and was stationed at Reni where she met a group of monitors and patrol boats that had been operating against Russia in the Black Sea. In October 1918, the Danube Flotilla was under serious threat of being cut off in the lower Danube by French forces after the Bulgarians concluded an armistice with the British and French. After the steamer Croatia was fired on by the French as it tried to get past Lom, she cut her <b>tow</b> <b>line,</b> releasing seven lighters, which ran aground on a sandbank. Croatia was hit, suffered casualties and grounded on the Romanian side of the river. The French retrieved three of the lighters and towed them into the anchorage at Lom. The following day, Enns and two other monitors managed to release three of the remaining lighters while under heavy French fire, and towed them upstream. The flotilla continued to retreat up the Danube, running the gauntlet of French and Serbian forces. With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in early November, the South Slavs went ashore at Vukovar. The Austrian, Hungarian and Czech crew members of the flotilla continued on their journey, arriving in Budapest on 6 November, and Enns began flying the Hungarian flag, {{as part of the}} navy of the Hungarian People's Republic. On 8 December, the monitors were seized by the Allies, and less than two weeks later Enns was towed to Belgrade where she was handed over to Serbia to be maintained on behalf of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia).|$|E

25|$|In 1912, {{the newly}} reorganized Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique {{purchased}} {{a number of}} second-hand ships—including La Bretagne—for its relaunch of South American service from France. La Bretagne sailed on the South American service through 1923, {{the last four years}} under the name of Alesia. In December 1923, Alesia was sold to a Dutch firm for scrapping. While {{on her way to the}} shipbreaker, Alesias <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> parted and the ship ran aground on the island of Texel, becoming a total loss.|$|E

25|$|On December 14, 2015 at {{approximately}} 15:45 the Spence suffered a sudden 25 degree list to starboard while in towing the Guantanamo Bay Express barge from a shipyard in Cartahena, Columbia {{where it had}} recently been overhauled and repaired to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to resume its normal resupply mission. The crew, unable to correct the list and fearing that the vessel would sink, abandoned ship by coming alongside the barge and jumping over to its deck. At around 17:30 the tug, still tethered to the barge with three 1,600 ft. <b>tow</b> <b>lines,</b> sank below the surface. An hour or two later, the crew heard three sharp bangs which {{are assumed to be}} the <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> breaking as the tug sank beyond the length of the <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> on its way to settling to the bottom 11,500 feet below the surface. The crew were rescued by the coast guard cutter Decisive early in the morning of December 15.|$|R

25|$|During {{a trip to}} Philadelphia, Bossi {{tested the}} speed at which a glider would take off under tow. The {{experiment}} consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A spring scale was attached to the <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist, the results confirming that a speed at which the necessary lift could be obtained was indeed attainable. This same experimental procedure was later repeated as part of the development of the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross.|$|E
25|$|From 17 June 1942, a Rotachute Mark III was air-towed {{behind a}} Tiger Moth on a 300ft (91.4 m) <b>tow</b> <b>line.</b> After two towed flights, the Rotachute was {{released}} {{at an altitude}} of 200ft (61 m) and made the first manned free flight and controlled landing. Further free flights were made from altitudes up to 3,900ft (1,189 m). On 1 July 1942, AFEE moved its main base from Ringway to RAF Sherburn-in-Elmet. Additional directional stability was achieved in the Rotachute Mark IV, that introduced endplates onto the rigid tailplanes.|$|E
25|$|The weather worsened; several {{attempts}} {{to attach a}} tow-line to U-570 were unsuccessful. Believing the Germans were being obstructive, Burwell's captain, S.R.J. Woods ordered a machine gunner to fire warning shots, shots that accidentally hit and slightly wounded five of the German crew. With much difficulty, an officer and three sailors from Kingston Agate reached the submarine using a Carley float (a liferaft). After a quick search failed to find the U-boat's Enigma machine, they attached a <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> and carried out {{the transfer of the}} five wounded men and the submarine's officers to Kingston Agate. The remaining crew were taken on board HMCS Niagara, which by this time had come alongside U-570.|$|E
50|$|Empress of Britain {{began to}} fill with water and list heavily. The tugs slipped the <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> and at 2.05am on 28 October, Empress of Britain sank {{northwest}} of Bloody Foreland, County Donegal (off Ireland at 55-16N 09-50W).|$|R

25|$|All but disabled, Winslow {{requested}} Hudson to tow {{her out of}} action. The revenue cutter {{approached the}} stricken torpedo boat and rigged a <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> between the two ships. As Hudson began to tow Winslow out to sea, {{one of the last}} Spanish shells to strike the torpedo boat hit her near the starboard gun and killed Ensign Worth Bagley who had been helping to direct the warship's maneuvers by carrying instructions from the deck {{to the base of the}} engine room ladder. Ensign Bagley became known as the first U.S. naval officer killed in the Spanish–American War, killed along with four other sailors, John Barberes, John Daniels, George B. Meek and E.B. Tunnell.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, Bossi {{heard of}} an {{airplane}} which had successfully flown while powered only by a 1-horsepower (0.75kW) engine. This prompted Bossi to calculate the minimum power that a manned aircraft would need to fly. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 0.94-horsepower (0.70kW), which convinced Bossi that Human-powered flight might be possible. During a trip to Philadelphia, Bossi tested {{the speed at which}} a glider would take off under tow. The experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A spring scale was attached to the <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist.

50|$|A {{depressor}} {{weight is}} a device used on <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> in nautical applications. A depressor weight can {{be attached to}} a floating or otherwise stiff line to effectively produce a catenary geometry better able to mitigate shocks associated with towing and wave impacts.|$|R
50|$|USS Bomazeen was {{originally}} the Bathgate, a tugboat built in 1919 at New York and {{purchased by the}} United States Navy on 29 December 1941 from the Meseck <b>Towing</b> <b>Lines.</b> She was renamed Bomazeen; designated YT 238 and placed in service on 4 February 1942.|$|R
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the <b>tow</b> <b>lines.</b> Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured <b>tow</b> <b>lines</b> and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|R
25|$|After being aground on {{the beach}} for 24 hours the Nimbin was success-fully refloated under her own power about 9:15am Tuesday 23 February. The cargo was intact but a {{quantity}} of oil was pumped from the tanks The company's vessel Ulmarra, which had been ordered to the scene, was standing by, and had a <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> aboard, but her assistance was not required The dredge Tethys from Ballina also stood by. Sea anchors had been placed some distance to seaward, and were secured with lines to the Nimbin When the tide was at flood, the Nimbin’s motors were started, and she hauled on the anchors, and soon slid off the sand The salvage gear had been taken to the Nimbin on Monday night After picking up the gear the Nimbin proceeded inside the Richmond River, safely negotiating the bar She then commenced to discharge her Sydney cargo The Ulmarra proceeded to the Clarence River. Captain Raymer, of the Nimbin, stated that the vessel was travelling at half speed in a heavy haze, which was hanging low over the sea, when the stranding occurred He said that no damage {{had been done to}} the vessel.|$|E
500|$|Although {{initially}} {{not expected}} to {{pose a threat to}} the chemicals on the ship Betula, rough seas near Lázaro Cárdenas caused all [...] of sulfuric acid to leak aboard the previously beached cargo tanker. The <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> snapped when a tug was taking it out to sea. Two of the four tanks broke off by July7.

Dampier ordered all non-essential crew to be taken off, boats from Liverpool and Olympic assisting, and only 250 men were left aboard by 14:00. At 13:30, Captain Herbert Haddock, the captain of Olympic, suggested that his ship attempt to take Audacious in tow. Dampier agreed, and {{with the assistance of the}} destroyer , a <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> was passed 30 minutes later. The ships began moving, but the line was severed when it was fouled by the cruiser's propellers.
