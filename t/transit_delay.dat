40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} transit, documentation, and ports and customs delays on Africa’s exports. The authors find that <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> have the most economically and statically significant effect on exports. A one-day reduction in inland travel times leads to a 7 percent increase in exports. Put another way, a oneday reduction in inland travel times translates to a 1. 5 percentage point decrease in all importing-country tariffs. By contrast, longer delays in the other areas have a far smaller impact on trade. The analysis controls {{for the possibility that}} greater trade leads to shorter delays in three ways. First, it {{examines the}} effect of trade times on exports of new products. Second, it evaluates the effect of <b>delays</b> in a <b>transit</b> country on the exports of landlocked countries. Third, it examines whether delays affect time sensitive goods relatively more. The authors show that large <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> are relatively more harmful because of high within-country variation. ...|$|R

By chance, the Germans had chosen the {{operating}} frequency of the Wotan system very badly; it operated on 45 MHz, which {{just happened to be}} the frequency of the powerful-but-dormant BBC television transmitter at Alexandra Palace. All Jones had to do was arrange for the return signal to be received from the aircraft and then sent to Alexandra Palace for re-transmission.

50|$|A radio {{clock is}} a clock that {{automatically}} synchronizes itself {{by means of}} government radio time signals received by a radio receiver. Many retailers market radio clocks inaccurately as atomic clocks; although the radio signals they receive originate from atomic clocks, they are not atomic clocks themselves. Normal low cost consumer grade receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10 Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite loopstick antennas and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine {{the beginning of a}} second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality quartz clocks for timekeeping between daily synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.Instrument grade time receivers provide higher accuracy. Such devices incur a <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> of approximately 1 ms for every 300 kilometres (186 mi) of distance from the radio transmitter. Many governments operate transmitters for time-keeping purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of matched filtering {{to the problem}} of very low frequency (VLF) radio signals ducted between magnetically conjugate points on the Earth by ionospheric plasma structures has been examined theoretically and implemented in recent field experiments. With accurate knowledge of the source VLF emissions, the subionospheric component of the received waveform can be effectively removed and the characteristics of the remaining ducted signal accurately estimated. Although the technique has been shown not to produce strictly consistent estimates of the subionospheric and ducted signal amplitudes, it is able to efficiently recover the <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> and amplitudes of ducted man-made whistler-mode emissions for reasonable values of the relevant signal to noise ratios. This is substantiated by the use of matched filtering to analyze data collected by radio receivers placed at the conjugate ends of a magnetic field line, thereby recovering the amplitudes and <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> of ducted signals with time-resolution as small as 30 seconds. An arbitrary degree of accuracy can be obtained in these measurements through the use of bit stream extraction and comparison...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{relation}} of demographic and psychological factors {{to the presence}} and extent of gut transit impairment in the functional gastrointestinal disorders has received little attention.  AIMS—To compare the psychosocial and demographic features of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders and <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> in one region of the gastrointestinal tract with those displaying more widespread <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> (that is, <b>delay</b> {{in two or three}} regions), and those with normal transit in all three regions.  PATIENTS—Of 110  outpatient participants who satisfied standardised criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders, 46  had <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> in one region, 32  had delay in two or three regions, and 17  exhibited normal transit in all regions.  METHODS—Transit in the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine was assessed concurrently using a wholly scintigraphic technique; psychological status was assessed using established psychometric measures.  RESULTS—Patients with <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> displayed demographic and psychological features that contrasted with patients with normal transit in all regions. In particular, widespread <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> featured female sex, a highly depressed mood state, increased age, frequent control of anger, and more severe gastric stasis, while the features distinguishing normal transit were male sex and high levels of hypochondriasis.  CONCLUSION—These data suggest the existence of a distinct psychophysiological subgroup, defined by the presence of <b>delayed</b> <b>transit,</b> in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.    Keywords: delayed gut transit; psychophysiology; sex; moo...|$|R

50|$|In computing, {{traceroute}} is {{a computer}} network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); {{the sum of the}} mean times in each hop {{is a measure of the}} total time spent to establish the connection. Traceroute proceeds unless all (three) sent packets are lost more than twice, then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated. Ping, on the other hand, only computes the final round-trip times from the destination point.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the path-determination problem in Internet core routers that distribute flows across alternate paths {{leading to the}} same destination. We assume that {{the remainder of the}} network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> beyond this router are different for the two paths, so a good routing policy can reduce the end-to-end delay by favoring the faster path. Thus, we propose and solve the optimal path-determination problem for a router, which minimizes the average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for a flow by dynamically assigning each packet to one of the available output ports based on their respective instantaneous queue lengths and on the average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for the associated path. We assume that all outgoing link speeds at the router are equal, but we generalize the model to allow each output port to serve a link group (such as an optical fiber using WDM) that consists of multiple physical channels running in parallel. By formulating path-selection as a Markov Decision Problem, we show that the optimal algorithm is a threshold-type policy that we call  ¢¡¤£¦¥¨ §...|$|E

In this study, we explored the regional effects of magnetization dispersion on quantitative perfusion imaging for varying transit times within a very large interval from the direct comparison of pulsed, pseudo-continuous, and dual-coil continuous arterial spin labeling encoding schemes. Longer distances between tagging and imaging region typically used for continuous tagging schemes enhance the regional bias on the quantitative cerebral blood flow measurement causing an underestimation up to 37 when plug flow is assumed as in the standard model...|$|E

Certain characteristics of the wireless links possible using this technology give rise to properties not seen with other wireless technologies.

This paper formulates a novel routing problem in UWB; in particular we investigate the impact of UWB physical layer characteristics on average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for a UWB network with a ring topology. The paper derives an expression of average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> {{as a function of the}} capacity between each pair of nodes in the network.
