5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives {{the probability that a}} particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal trade policy for exporting firms in oligopolistic industries. The analysis {{is based on}} a minimum set of restrictions on the profit functions and with an arbitrary number of domestic and foreign producers. In an industry with quantity competition, a simple rule is derived that shows how to determine the direction of an optimal trade policy in terms of a few characteristics of the model. The analysis makes clear how scale economies (in a particular sense) favor <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> export subsidy, while product differentiation tends to support <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> export tax.

5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 he {{was again}} tried and sentenced for 2 years, {{on charges of}} {{embezzlement}} of a donation of 57,000 Euro. Initially, the Court refuted the indictment, but the Court of Appeal returned <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> retrial. In the second trial, the defendants were acquitted of the indictment, but the Court of Appeal returned <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third trial. On the third trial both defendants were found guilty, and as a second defendant, Jovan Vraniškovski was sentenced 2 years imprisonment, where the first defendant was sentenced to 1 year and 3 months imprisonment. He was imprisoned on August 8, 2006 and served 256 days before being released.|$|E

25|$|Europa {{has much}} {{indirect}} evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa {{is affected by}} Tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water or warm ice in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the Galileo spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> liquid, rather than solid, layer; an electrically conductive fluid deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> liquid subsurface ocean. As {{was the case for}} Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa {{due to the lack of}} water in the space near Europa.|$|E

25|$|Viscosity is {{measured}} with {{various types of}} viscometers and rheometers. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> viscometer. Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5°C.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began in}} mid-1960, with the {{official}} opening on November 1, 1963. As the primary dish is spherical, its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parabolic reflector. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow frequency band: 2–5% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the Australian pound {{remained}} tied to the pound sterling. Inflation in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but {{more than in the}} United States. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> central bank was increased by the need for the government to cut spending after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor Denison Miller had been arguing for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.|$|E
30|$|In {{our model}} with {{exogenous}} qualities, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> “advertising-free” publicly owned platform is associated to socially harmful advertising, {{whereas in the}} model of endogenous qualities, González-Maestre and Martínez-Sánchez (2012) obtain cases where an “advertising-free” publicly owned platform is optimal even if advertising is socially beneficial. Therefore, the policy implications {{with respect to the}} advertising regulation in the public platform are substantially different between both scenarios.|$|R

25|$|It was the Eastern Region's Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, {{who made}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new design of {{powerful}} freight locomotive, able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour {{shift of the}} footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five coupled axles can provide. The resultant design {{became one of the}} most successful locomotive classes ever constructed in Britain.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December, with Pakistan facing {{imminent}} defeat, the United States {{requested that}} the Security Council be reconvened. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was rushed to New York City to make <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> resolution on the cease fire. The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan's forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic. Bhutto, frustrated {{by the failure of}} the resolution and the inaction of the United Nations, ripped up his speech and left the council.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{a recent}} paper, Keren Haroush and Ziv Williams {{outlined}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> group of neurons in primates' brains that uniquely predicted the choice selection of their interacting partner. These primates' neurons, located in the anterior cingulate cortex of rhesus monkeys, were observed using single-unit recording while the monkeys played {{a variant of the}} iterative prisoner's dilemma game. By identifying cells that represent the yet unknown intentions of a game partner, Haroush & Williams' study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a fundamental and generalized process, and suggests that anterior cingulate cortex neurons may potentially act to complement the function of mirror neurons during social interchange.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 Parliament {{approved}} a major upgrade to the mining facilities, which would cost NOK20 million, {{in the hope}} that production could reach 200,000 tonnes. In 1956 two brothers, Einar Sverre and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen, through their company Norsk Polar Navigasjon, proposed that an airport be built at Kvadehussletta, on the outer-most point of Brøggerhalvøya. It was met by opposition from both Norwegian and Soviet authorities and no permits were granted, even though they pursued <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks, and production remained low during the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnification}} of {{the detail}} also varies with focal length; {{for a given}} detail, {{the ratio of the}} blur disk diameter to imaged size of the detail is independent of focal length, depending only on the detail size and its distance from the subject. This ratio can be useful when {{it is important that the}} background be recognizable (as usually is the case in evidence or surveillance photography), or unrecognizable (as might be <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pictorial photographer using selective focus to isolate the subject from a distracting background). As a general rule, an object is recognizable if the blur disk diameter is one-tenth to one-fifth the size of the object or smaller (Williams 1990, 205), and unrecognizable when the blur disk diameter is the object size or greater.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, {{the effects}} of No balls may be cumulative, and may reach beyond the {{completion}} of the game. No balls called under Law 41 are judged dangerous and unfair, and in common with most transgressions of Law 41 further sanctions will follow. The bowler may be prevented from bowling {{for the rest of the}} innings, may face disciplinary action by bodies governing the game, and may be required to change the way he bowls. This is also <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowler called under Law 21 for throwing. Sanctions now also apply for the deliberate bowling of front foot No balls. Law 41 gives the umpires specific duties to ensure the safe conduct of the game in the case of unfair bowling.|$|E
