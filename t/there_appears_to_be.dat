5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's {{actions against}} Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E
5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that competition was limited by geographical separation. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no correlation with distance from the sea. Neither Daspletosaurus nor Gorgosaurus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, while there is some overlap, Gorgosaurus {{appears to be more}} common at northern latitudes, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation and in southwestern North America during the Campanian. Thomas Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. Holtz notes that, {{at the end of the}} later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were very rare.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E
