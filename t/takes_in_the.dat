5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon <b>takes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alloy.|$|E

25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the red ball is not <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the red ball is not <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third draw, under the condition that it was not <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking <b>the</b> red ball <b>in</b> n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n <b>in</b> Wallenius’ model. <b>The</b> exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|R
