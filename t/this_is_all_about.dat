500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never got to play the songs live. [...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> [...] I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a concert}} in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in April 1966, Dylan said of the song, [...] "This is, this is called Tom Thumb. This story takes place outside of Mexico City. It begins in Mexico City and it ends really in Des Moines, Iowa, but it's all about this painter, he's a quite older fellow, he comes from Juarez, Juarez is down cross of Texas border, some few feets, and he's a painter. He's very very {{well-known}} painter in the area there and we all call him Tom Thumb and when Tom Thumb was going through his blue period, {{this is one of}} the most important times of his whole life and he's going to sell many many paintings now taken from his blue period and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Tom Thumb and his early days and so we name this Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" ...|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for {{comments}} made on Breakfast regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on {{a newspaper article}} about the Australian government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be [...] "broadened out", saying: [...] "I mean if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and you could put them in homestay situations. The mentally ill."

2500|$|JoJo didn't want to {{keep her}} fans waiting for new music due to ongoing label issues; thus, she began {{recording}} material specifically for the mixtape. Originally JoJo thought of naming the mixtape Live Free or Die after the New Hampshire state motto (which inspired the tattoo {{on the back of}} her neck), but upon further thought, JoJo stated [...] "it sounded dramatic and militant and scary.

Not about industry politics, agendas, empty-promises, ego, swag, pretension, or a budget of any kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} the criticisms of Kenneth W.

'When I decided to write this book, I didn't even think about {{involving}} Ken, from ancient times, to come in and help.'" [...] Carter's biographer Douglas Brinkley has observed that Stein and Carter have a [...] "passionate, up-and-down relationship" [...] and that Stein has criticized some of Carter's previous statements about Israel. In response to Professor Stein's current criticism of the book, representatives of its publisher, Simon & Schuster, state: [...] "We haven't seen these allegations, we haven't seen any specifics, and I have no way of assessing anything he [...] has said. ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> nothing. We stand behind the book fully, and the fact that there has been a divided reaction to it is not surprising." ...|$|E
