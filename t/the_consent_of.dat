5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|The Titles of Nobility Amendment (pending {{before the}} states since May 1, 1810) would, if ratified, strip {{citizenship}} from any United States citizen who accepts a title of nobility or honor {{from a foreign}} country without <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> Congress.|$|E

25|$|Previously <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> was 14, <b>the</b> {{lowest in}} the United States. Avery Chumbley, {{a member of the}} Hawaiian Senate, had made efforts to raise <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b> <b>The</b> age <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> was changed to 16 by Act 1, House Bill 236, passed by the Legislature of Hawaii in 2001.|$|R

5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, at {{the request}} of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire, {{reflecting}} its self-governing status.

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, land {{appears to}} have been held in common with an {{individual}} unable to sell it without <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community. Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India's west coast such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, landlords never sold land without <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate {{a certain amount of money}} known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non-interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages.|$|E

5|$|Unanimity was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members.

5|$|A few holdouts {{remained}} for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender {{and it was}} first ruled {{for a short time}} by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.|$|E

The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister {{during the period of}} transition.|$|E

5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
