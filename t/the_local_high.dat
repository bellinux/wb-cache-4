The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>high</b> noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
