Methods A cross sectional study was conducted from August 2003 to March 2004 on leather tannery workers of Karachi, Pakistan. Data were collected from 641 workers engaged in 95 different tanneries in Korangi industrial area selected as sample of convenience. Face to face interviews were performed using a structured pre-tested questionnaire by trained data collectors. Results Prevalence of adult asthma was 10. 8 % (69 / 641) in this study population. The prevalence of perceived work-related asthma was 5. 3 % (34 / 641). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that after {{taking into account the}} age effect, the leather <b>tannery</b> <b>worker</b> {{were more likely to be}} asthmatic, if they were illiterate (adjusted OR = 2. 13, 95 % CI: 1. 17 – 3. 88), of Pathan ethnicity (adjusted OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI: 1. 35 – 5. 36), ever-smoked (adjusted OR = 2. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 16 – 4. 26), reportedly never used gloves during different tanning tasks (OR = 3. 28; 95 % CI : 1. 72 – 6. 26). Also, the final model showed a significant interaction between perceived allergy and duration of work. Those who perceived to have allergy were more likely to have asthma if their duration of work was 8 years (adjusted OR = 2. 26; 95 % CI: 1. 19 – 4. 29) and this relationship was even stronger if duration was 13 years (adjusted OR = 3. 67; 95 % CI: 1. 98 – 6. 79). Conclusion Prevalence of asthma in leather tannery workers appears to be high and is associated with educational status, ethnicity, smoking, glove use, perceived to have allergy and duration of work. </p...|$|E

40|$|The use of hair {{chromium}} (Cr) concentrations as {{an index}} of Cr exposure of <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> was investigated. As has been shown earlier, Cr from Cr III compounds used in the leather tanning industry is absorbed because concentrations of Cr in serum and urine of <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> are significantly increased compared with corresponding concentrations for unexposed controls. Hair samples were collected from 71 male <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> from four southern Ontario tanneries and from 53 male controls not exposed to Cr in the workplace. Subjects were matched for age, race, and socioeconomic status. Hair samples were washed, ashed in a low temperature asher, and analysed by flameless atomic absorption. The median hair Cr concentrations for the <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> (551 ng/g) was significantly higher (p = 0. 0001) than for the controls (123 ng/g). For the <b>tannery</b> <b>workers,</b> hair Cr concentrations were positively and significantly correlated with serum Cr (r = 0. 52, p less than 0. 01) and with the preshift and postshift urinary Cr/creatinine ratios (r = 0. 43, p less than 0. 01; r = 0. 64, p less than 0. 01, respectively). These data indicate that trivalent Cr absorbed from leather tanning compounds results in raised concentrations of Cr in hair and that hair Cr concentrations {{may be used as}} {{an index of}} industrial Cr exposure...|$|R

The project is also aimed at {{the improvement of the}} living conditions of the population, by installing drinking water and drainage systems. A socio-economic unit in the project supports the technical interventions by enhancing the community to participate in project activities. The Occupational Health Programme in Jajmau, an industrial slum of Kanpur, aims to improve the working conditions of tannery workers. Four hundred and ninety-seven tannery workers and 80 employees not engaged in leather work, from 20 tanneries, were interviewed and underwent physical examination. The mean age of tannery workers was 32 years, about half of them recently migrated to Kanpur. The majority of the workers are illiterate, have temporary jobs and 85 % have a monthly income between 300 and 600 Rs. Occupational morbidity was 28. 2 %. Regular meetings with tannery owners, the training of tannery workers in first aid, and support for the installation of safety and health councils in tanneries are the main programme activities. A walk through survey to detect occupational and safety hazards and the workshop "Higher productivity and a better place to work' in collaboration with the International Labour Office (ILO) led to industrial modification in the tanneries.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the adverse effects of occupational exposure to trivalent chromium. We measured chromium and iron levels in serum and urine and hemoglobin levels in <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> and unexposed persons. We studied three groups of subjects. Group 1 included 15 non-smoking male <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> highly exposed to chromium from tanning and retanning departments. Group 2 included 14 non-smoking male <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> with moderate chromium exposure from dying, drying and finishing departments. Group 3 included 11 healthy, non-smoking male subjects without direct chromium exposure. Higher serum chromium levels were observed in groups 1 and 2 with respect to group 3 (mean values respectively: 0. 43; 0. 25 and 0. 13 µg·l – 1). Urine chromium levels in group 1 were higher than those in controls (mean values: 1. 78 and 1. 35 µg·l – 1). In group 1 an inverse association was found between serum chromium and urine iron (– 0. 524), urine chromium and hemoglobin (– 0. 594) and between the urine chromium to iron ratio and hemoglobin (– 0. 693, p< 0. 05). The results suggest a chromium adverse effect on iron metabolism, possibly associated with excessive body chromium accumulation.

Occupational skin diseases in <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> in newly industrialized countries have been reported, but neither the prevalence of occupational allergic contact dermatitis nor the skin-sensitizing agents were specifically examined in those studies. Objectives. To assess the prevalence of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in Indonesian tanneries, identify the causative allergens, and propose a tannery work series of patch test allergens. Patients/methods A cross-sectional study in all workers at two Indonesian tanneries was performed to assess the prevalence of occupational contact dermatitis via a questionnaire-based interview and skin examination. Workers with occupational contact dermatitis were patch tested to identify the causative allergens. Results. Occupational contact dermatitis was suspected in 77 (16 %) of the 472 workers. Thirteen (3 %) of these 472 workers were confirmed to have occupational allergic contact dermatitis.

40|$|Background. There is {{increasing}} {{concern over the}} health effects of chromium (Cr) exposure stemming from various activities in tanneries in Kenya. Chromium is a toxic metal in its hexavalent form, and is widely used in the tanning process. Objectives. A detailed exposure assessment of Cr and related health effects among <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> in Kenya was performed. Methods. Spot urine and 8 -hour full-shift personal breathing zone air samples of the workers (N = 40) and control group (N = 40) were collected and subsequently analyzed for total Cr using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The medical history, respiratory, and dermatological condition of each of the selected workers was determined. Lung function was further investigated using a spirometer. Results. <b>Tannery</b> <b>workers</b> in various production lines had significantly (P < 0. 05) higher mean airborne Cr levels (± standard deviation [SD] of 63. 0 ± 11. 6 μg/m 3) compared to those in the control group (1. 39 ± 0. 64 μg/m 3), and general workers had significantly (P < 0. 05) higher mean concentrations of Cr (66. 8 ± 13. 1 μg/m 3) than those in other lines of production. A significant positive association (R 2 = 0. 76, P < 0. 001) was also observed between urinary and breathing zone air Cr levels. Mean urinary Cr level exceeded the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists biological exposure index for Cr of 30 μg/g creatinine, and 78 % of Cr levels of the general workers exceeded this limit. <b>Tannery</b> <b>workers</b> showed a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher prevalence of respiratory and dermatological symptoms (30 % and 20 %, respectively) compared to the control group (10 % and 7. 5 %, respectively). It was further established that production workers had significantly reduced ventilatory function, with 17 % experiencing pulmonary obstruction, 13 % pulmonary restriction, and 7. 5 % both manifestations compared to 5 % for each of the listed corresponding manifestations in the control group.

During the present study, the effect of Cr on the hematological indices in TW was evaluated. In this study, hematological indices of 92 male TW aged 20 – 60 years were compared with 79 control males who hardly had a chance of exposure to chromium. Both groups were subdivided into four age groups with an interval of 10 : group A, 20 – 29 years; group B, 30 – 39 years; group C, 40 – 49 years; group D, 50 – 60 years. Total erythrocyte count (TEC) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in TW of age group A, B and C than control subjects.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Tannery</b> <b>workers</b> {{are exposed}} to {{hazardous}} chemicals. Tannery work is outsourced to newly industrialized countries (NICs) where attention into occupational health hazards is limited. In this study, we investigated the skin exposure to hazardous chemicals in <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> and determined the prevalence of occupational skin diseases (OSDs) at tanneries in a NIC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on the observation of the working process and an inventory and risk assessment of the chemicals used. Classification of chemicals as potential sensitizers/irritants and a qualitative assessment of exposure to these chemicals. Workers were examined and interviewed using Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire- 2002 /LONG. RESULTS: The risk of OSDs at the investigated tanneries was mainly related to the exposure of the workers' skin to chemicals in hot and humid environmental conditions. In 472 workers, 12 % reported a current OSD and 9 % reported a history of OSD. In 10 % of all cases, an OSD was confirmed by a dermatologist and 7. 4 % had an occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). We observed that personal protective equipment (PPE) used was mainly because of skin problems {{in the past and}} not as a primary protection against OSD. CONCLUSION: We observed a high frequency and prolonged exposure to many skin hazardous factors in tannery work although PPE was relatively easily available and which was generally used as a secondary preventative measure. The observed point-prevalence in this study was at the same level as that reported for other high-risk OSDs in Western countries and other tanneries in NICs.

50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|R

RESULTS: All cause mortality was {{similar to that of the}} general population. The most remarkable excess was for bladder cancer (observed 10, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 242, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 116 to 446).

O cromo na urina indicou que os trabalhadores estavam com maior concentraÃÃo deste metal na urina que os nÃo expostos (p< 0, 05) (1, 108 Â 1, 277 vs 0, 089 Â 0, 027). As correlaÃÃes (Pearson) entre o cromo na urina e as anÃlises genotÃxicas indicaram forte relaÃÃo positiva com a frequÃncia de aberraÃÃes cromossÃmicas (r= 0, 841 p= 0, 018) e frequÃncia de micronÃcleo em linfÃcitos (r= 0, 730 p < 0, 0001). Conclui-se que os trabalhadores de curtume apresentam riscos de toxicidade e de instabilidade genÃtica associados Ã exposiÃÃo ocupacional a misturas quÃmicas contendo crmo III. Occupational {{exposure in}} tannery environments {{has been the}} subject of study and scientific research. Controversial information about the toxicity of chromium III and its relationship with the epidemiology of the tannery employees served as a subsidy for this research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible genotoxic and mutagenic effects of the exposure of <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> in Teresina (PI) to chemicals containing chromium III through the use of biomarkers of DNA and chromosomal damage. This was a cross-sectional, observational and quantitative study. Samples were taken from the mucosa, blood and urine of 43 <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> to analyze mucosal micronuclei (20 workers), lymphocytic micronuclei (30 workers), mucosal comet assays (20 workers), lymphocytic comet assay (43 workers) and chromosomal aberrations (30 workers); the level of urinary chromium was also measured (27 employees). The same analyses were carried out in non-exposed <b>workers</b> of the <b>tannery</b> environment for statistical comparison. In addition, personal health questionnaires were administered as recommended by the International Commission for Protection Against Environmental Mutagens and Carcinogens-ICPEMC with the aim of correlating their information with data obtained in the tests. The results indicated significant increases (p < 0. 05) in: the number (8. 100 Â 3. 905 vs 1. 200 Â 1. 609) and frequency (0. 403 Â 0. 060 vs. 0. 1513 Â 0. 04887) of mucosal micronuclei; the number (17. 73 Â 9. 44 vs 10. 90 Â 7. 092) and frequency (0. 886 Â 0. 472 vs 0. 306 Â 0. 202) of lymphocytic micronuclei; and the total (16. 3 Â 3. 38 vs 0. 60 Â 0. 16) and frequency (8. 01 Â 1. 82 vs 0. 403 Â 0. 09) of chromosomal aberrations (Studentâs t test). There was a significant increase (ANOVA, p < 0. 05) for all types of damage and frequency of damage to the mucosal and lymphocytic COMET assay. Urine chromium levels was higher in exposed workers than in non-exposed workers (p < 0. 05) (1. 108 Â 1. 277 vs 0. 089 Â 0. 027). Pearson correlations between the level of chromium in the urine and genotoxic analyses indicated a strong positive correlation with the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (r = 0. 841, p = 0. 018) and frequency of lymphocytic micronuclei (r = 0. 730, p < 0. 0001). It was concluded that the <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> are at risk of toxicity and genetic instability associated with occupational exposure to chemical mixtures containing chromium III...|$|R
40|$|Our {{mutagenesis}} {{group has}} been studying with important economic drivers of our state, such as agriculture, the foot-wear and leather industry and open-cast coal mining. Working conditions in these sectors have potentially harmful to humans. The aim of these studies {{is to determine the}} health risk of workers by biomonitoring subjects exposed to genotoxic agents. The main results of our studies with vineyard farmers we observed a high rate of MN and DNA damage in individuals exposed to pesticides (p < 0. 001). In addition, some effects of genetic polymorphisms in the modulation of MN results were observed in this group. Tobacco farmers were also evaluated at different crop times. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} Damage index and frequency in tobacco farmers compared to the non-exposed group, for all crop times. The results for footwear and <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> showed a significant increase in the mean ID for the solvent-based adhesive (p < 0. 001) group in comparison to the water-based adhesive group and control (p < 0. 05). For open-cast coal mine workers, the EBCyt indicated a significant increase in nuclear bud fre-quency and cytokinetic defects in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group (p < 0. 0001). We were able to associate specific genetic susceptibility with each type of exposure and with the non-use or improper use of personal protection equipment and diet adequacy. These results show how important the continuous education of exposed workers is to minimizing the effect of the occupational exposure and the risk of disease associated with the work...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of selenium and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined in blood of 34 <b>workers</b> of a <b>tannery</b> in Gniezno, Poland, {{who worked in}} an area containing chromium compounds. Fourteen workers were exposed to chromium compounds at concentrations of 0. 11 +/- 0. 07 mg Cr/m 3 (mean +/- SD) and 20 at concentrations 5 - 10 times lower i. e., 0. 022 +/- 0. 009 mg Cr/m 3. Excretion of Se in urine was measured {{in all of the}} investigated workers. Decreased Se concentration in whole blood and blood plasma and elevated TBARS concentration in blood plasma were found in the whole group of investigated tanners as compared to controls. Tanners working in areas with high chromium concentrations had a statistically significant decrease in Se concentration in blood and plasma and decreased urinary excretion of the microelement as compared with other tanners. TBARS concentration was 2. 5 times lower in workers exposed to higher chromium concentrations (p < 0. 005) than in other workers. Positive linear correlations were found between the {{concentration of}} Se in blood and the amount of the element excreted in urine (r = 0. 48; p < 0. 005), the concentration of Se in blood plasma and in urine (r = 0. 46; p < 0. 01), and the concentration of Se in blood and erythrocyte GSH-Px activity (r = 0. 42; p < 0. 02). The observed differences between Se concentration in blood and urine of <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> and people who are not employed in the industry may indicate a kind of specific adaptation of the body to the working environment containing chromium compounds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Aims: To {{assess how}} a 10 year {{extension}} of the follow up period affected cancer incidence in the Swedish leather tanning cohort. Methods: A cohort of 2027 <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> (of which 482 were women) who had been employed {{for at least one}} year between 1900 and 1989 at one of three Swedish leather tanneries, was established. The start of observation varied between 1958 and 1966 for the three plants. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry, incident cancer cases were recorded up to 1999. Cause specific expected cancer incidence was calculated for 1958 - 99 based on calendar year, sex, and five year age group specific incidence rates for the counties where the plants had been located. Altogether 56 022 person-years at risk were generated. Results: A total of 351 incident cancer cases were observed compared to 302 expected, which resulted in an increased standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1. 16 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 29). An enhanced risk for prostate cancer was observed (SIR 1. 44, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 86), mainly attributable to the later part of the observation period (1990 - 99). In this updated analysis the previously observed risk excess for soft tissue sarcomas was no longer significant (SIR 2. 62, 95 % CI 0. 96 to 5. 70). For multiple myelomas and sinonasal cancer the slight non-significant excesses remained, still based on very few cases. Conclusions: The increased risk for prostate cancer in the present study might be a chance finding, but is noteworthy, since it is in acccordance with the finding of increased SIR for prostate cancer among leather workers in another recent Swedish study. Moreover, excess risks for prostate cancer among farmers have been reported, indicating pesticides as possible causative agents. Leather tanners have also been exposed to pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Globally, it is {{estimated}} that over 2, 518, 200 tons of hides and skins were exported in the year 2011 alone, with an estimated world production yield of 23 billion square feet of finished leather (FA 0, 2011; Mwinyihija, 2011). While some manufacturers have adopted eco-friendly production methods, most tanneries still practice the old-fashioned techniques, which can create negative impacts on the environment and the health of industry employees due to the generation of solid (e. g., chromium salts) and liquid (e. g., untreated water) waste full of toxic chemicals (Iyer, & Mastorakis, 2009). While consumer behaviors and their purchase intentions related to their beliefs have been widely studied, researchers have not investigated consumer beliefs and attitude regarding leather production and whether their environmental values and knowledge impact their beliefs about leather products, attitudes towards purchasing leather products, and intentions to purchase leather products. To fill in a gap in the current research on consumer behavior and using the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein, 1967), Dickson’s (2000) extension of the theory and Dunlap's (2008) New Ecological Paradigm as a guide, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether exposure to information regarding the environmental and health impact of leather production would ultimately change consumers’ beliefs, attitudes and intentions to purchase leather products. A survey questionnaire was used to examine changes in consumers' beliefs, attitudes and intentions to purchase leather products using a modified classical experimental design with a pre-test and post-test format. Two Oregon State University undergraduate classes in the Department of Design and Human Environment were recruited to participate in the study. One class received an informational treatment lecture on leather production, while the other did not. A total of 72 Oregon State University undergraduate students participated in the study. The findings supported the previous works of the Theory of Reasoned Action and its extension, arguing that consumer knowledge and beliefs regarding specific products impact consumer attitudes, specifically consumer attitude toward leather production's health impact. It was also found that within the experimental group relative to their New Ecological Paradigm score, students with a higher New Ecological Paradigm score were found to have more significant changes when comparing pre-test and post-test results at an individual level. These findings provide evidence to support the importance of understanding how knowledge impacts consumer beliefs, attitudes and purchase intentions. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated a change in beliefs toward leather production and its health impact on <b>tannery</b> <b>workers</b> after exposure to the treatment lecture. While beliefs and attitudes toward leather production were not impacted by the treatment lecture, this study still provides information to those hoping to have an impact on consumers via knowledge delivery. Having an understanding of how beliefs, attitudes and purchase intention are impacted by information provides retailers with valuable insight of how to effectively deliver their information to consumers that will reach them on a deeper level. This will help them to better reach their target market, give their messages more impact and influence consumers' beliefs and future buying decisions. Future research in this field will add to the growing research area regarding knowledge and its impact on consumers...|$|R
