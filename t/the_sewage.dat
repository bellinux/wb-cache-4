5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly <b>the</b> <b>sewage,</b> sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. <b>The</b> <b>sewage</b> problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of <b>the</b> <b>sewage,</b> people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is {{situated}} westwards from the Great Arsenal. The city wall, {{built at the}} same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress.

5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> system, sending {{hundreds of millions of}} gallons of sewage into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of households {{are connected to}} a public sewage system (93%), with the reminaing 7% connected through cesspits. <b>The</b> <b>sewage</b> system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Singaperumal is {{transferred}} and a corrupt officer (Vinu Chakravarthy) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja and together, they urge Gemini {{to work for}} them and repay for the losses they incurred but Gemini refuses. To force him to return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realises that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Sewage</b> Control Board.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a storm tide of 3.6feet (1.1m) above normal in Norfolk. Sustained winds peaked at 60mph (95km/h) in Langley Air Force Base, while gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) in Norfolk. The bands {{of the storm}} spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44inches (164mm) at a location 2miles (3.2km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well. Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt. This forced <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.|$|E
5|$|Scully learns from {{blood tests}} that the {{contaminated}} water causes rapid cellular damage and dramatically increases sodium chloride in the body. She tries to ration the drinkable water amongst the three, but discovers Trondheim attempting to hoard what little that remains. Trondheim locks Scully out of <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> hold, {{forcing her to}} use minuscule supplies to keep Mulder alive. The corrosion eventually eats through the ship's hull, flooding the hold and drowning Trondheim, who cannot unseal the hatch. The agents both lose consciousness shortly before Navy rescuers arrive at their former ship. Scully comes to at the hospital, where she is told that her written observations on the case helped naval doctors reverse their aging and save Mulder from near-certain death. Scully says {{that she wants to}} return to the Ardent for more research, but the doctor tells her that the ship sank shortly after their rescue due to the flooding.|$|E
5|$|The smell, and people's {{fears of}} its {{possible}} effects, prompted {{action from the}} local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting sewers that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern Outfall Sewers started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the sewers ran—the Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments.|$|E

5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} growth across South Wales {{drove up the}} demand for new housing for the growing workforce. Bute {{was not prepared to}} sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the lessee to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease {{at the end of this}} term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. Very little money was invested in <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{prevailing}} arguments {{of the day that}} Pettenkofer focused on was <b>the</b> relationship between <b>sewage</b> and <b>the</b> health of a population. In one of his first major projects in his home city of Munich Pettenkofer advocated for the development of running water throughout the city. He also emphasized the selection of the Mangfall River, not the readily at hand and highly polluted Isar River, as the source of the city's drinking water.

25|$|A new {{sewage system}} {{was built on}} Don's orders in 1815, but this was so poorly {{designed}} that it actually worsened Gibraltar's sanitary problems. It had no ability to be flushed and was insufficiently inclined to keep <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> flowing out to the bay. As a result, the system merely brought sewage down from {{the upper part of}} the town to the lower part, where it piled up under the main streets. <b>The</b> <b>sewage</b> remained there until the winter rains dislodged it and flushed it into the bay. Because the outfalls were so short, however, <b>the</b> <b>sewage</b> simply washed back up onto the shoreline and resulted in the seafront being coated in a slick of effluent.|$|E
