25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god {{on a piece of paper}} above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E

500|$|On April 10, 1834, a fire {{broke out}} in the LaLaurie {{residence}} on Royal Street, starting in the kitchen. [...] When the police and fire marshals got there, they found a seventy-year-old woman, the cook, chained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> by her ankle. [...] She later confessed to them that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt for fear of her punishment, being taken to the uppermost room, because she said that anyone who was taken there never came back. [...] As reported in the New Orleans Bee of April 11, 1834, bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated. [...] Upon being refused the keys by the LaLauries, the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found [...] "seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated... suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other", who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months.|$|E

2500|$|The {{condition}} {{of education in}} Nesna at the beginning o the 19th century was described as [...] "lamentable". The education Augustinussen himself had received had mainly been from home and through the priest who lent him books. When he was asked in parliament where he studied, he answered: [...] "Actually I ought {{to tell you that}} I was taught at home next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> by my mother". It was the curate who was responsible for teaching, and Nesna had been saddled with several awful curates. The curate Müller, in 1811, had to resign his post [...] "due to adultery", and his successor Peter Eggen, who was curate during Augustinussen's childhood and early years, had little more success. He was a cobbler without any pedagogical qualifications and liked to drink and [...] "chase women". Jenssen writes that [...] "he had nothing to teach + {{for the simple reason that}} he knew nothing". The pastor at the time Christian Qvale testified that [...] "He combined lewdness with the greatest incompetence" [...], whilst the later priest Dometius wrote of Eggen that «Han cultivated both Bacchus and Venus and was a general annoyance".|$|E

40|$|This project {{researched}} {{high efficiency}} wood <b>stoves</b> used in <b>the</b> internally displaced peoples? camps in Northern Uganda.

To produce an efficient stove I tried <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> most complete combustion possible, while also maintaining a very high degree of heat flow to whatever object was being cooked. The first step in this process was <b>to</b> compare <b>the</b> performance of the currently used ?Six Bricks Rocket Stove? with that of an open fire. After that I quantified how modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of the openings at {{the top and bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> affected <b>the</b> performance. The standard I used <b>to</b> compare <b>the</b> <b>stoves</b> performance against was how much wood and the time it took to boil three liters of water on a pot without a lid. With this research I found that the ?Six Bricks Rocket Stove? used about 46 % less fuel then a conventional open fire. This finding is significant when considering the scarcity of fire wood and the danger associated with gathering it for the Northern Ugandan?s who live in the Internal Displaced Peoples? Camps...|$|R
