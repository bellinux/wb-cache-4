25|$|Among rice cultivars, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the {{responses}} to, and recovery from, pest damage. Many rice varieties {{have been selected}} for resistance to insect pests. Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite insect infestation.|$|E
25|$|The {{classes of}} CYPs most often {{investigated}} in non-human animals are those either involved in development (e.g., retinoic acid or hormone metabolism) or {{involved in the}} metabolism of toxic compounds (such as heterocyclic amines or polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Often <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> gene regulation or enzyme function of CYPs in related animals that explain observed differences in susceptibility to toxic compounds (ex. canines inability to metabolize xanthines such as caffeine). Some drugs undergo metabolism in both species via different enzymes, resulting in different metabolites, while other drugs are metabolized in one species but excreted unchanged in another species. For this reason, one species's reaction to a substance is not a reliable indication of the substance's effects in humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{absence of}} any ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) has caused {{problems}} for cricket historians and especially statisticians. Important matches that meet the official definitions, assuming they featured teams of the necessary high standard, have been recorded since 1697 having been in vogue since the 1660s. It was inevitable that historians and statisticians would seek to apply unofficial first-class status retrospectively, in contravention of the ICC and MCC directives. The position is that each writer must compile his own list based on his personal opinions. As a result, significant differences may be observed in published statistical records with particular impact on the career records of W. G.
