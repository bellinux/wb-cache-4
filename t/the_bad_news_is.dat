Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

India Today gave the film 3 stars: [...] "The good news first.

[...] Abhishek Gupta of India TV gave it 2.5 stars and wrote, [...] "The comedy along with the action is rarely served with equal entertainment in today's cinema.

2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. <b>The</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E

[...] As {{an example of what}} he felt should have been included, Cooper notes [...] "In spite of the book’s strength in depicting Wilson’s family life, it is also oddly unsatisfactory about one of its most important figures: his father." [...] As another example, Cooper states that [...] "Equally glaring is the lack of attention to Wilson’s thought." [...] Cooper questions Berg's inclusion of the memories of Wilson wife by saying [...] "Kristie Miller’s excellent biography of Wilson’s two wives could have raised red flags about Edith’s memory." [...] Cooper not only disputes Berg's framing of Wilson's racism but also his religious perspective, calling into question the use of Bible quotations {{at the beginning of each}} chapter: [...] "Other reviewers have found this practice tiresome; I found it unenlightening and strange." [...] Cooper ends by saying [...] "To sum up, this biography has much to recommend it, especially the pleasure it affords in reading it. Its shortcomings make it far from balanced or comprehensive, much less “definitive." ...|$|E
