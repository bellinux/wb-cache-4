5|$|Structure C12 is a south-facing {{platform}} {{built from}} pumice. It divides the West Plaza in two. The upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{marked by a}} circle of burnt clay formed by the burning of incense.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> IND's usual {{length of}} 660 feet, and {{the width of}} <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> 16 feet.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967, <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{extended}} to accommodate eight-car trains, and <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> again extended in November 1976 to accommodate ten-car trains.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{lengthened}} to take ten carriage trains. The goods yard {{closed and}} {{five of the six}} rolling stock sidings were decommissioned in 1968. The signal box closed the following year. In 1992 <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> lengthened again and in 2012 <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> again being extended to take twelve carriage trains.|$|R
5|$|Rogerstone {{station is}} miles (2km) {{southeast}} of Risca and Pontymister station, and miles (6km) {{northwest of the}} South Wales Main Line. The station has one platform: the line reverts to single track after having passed Risca. Near <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> a pick up/set down lay-by. Rogerstone station's car park has 64 spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> in a {{considerably}} preserved state as well, although {{parts of it}} have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a ramp to <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> <b>is</b> unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of two insular <b>platforms</b> while <b>the</b> western one is broader and more heavily used. There are 4 tracks available. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> connected to each other with the pedestrian bridge. In the middle of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> semi-transparent roofs <b>are</b> installed. The south end of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> curved. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by <b>the</b> depot tracks so the only way in and out is via the bridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> {{covered and}} {{accessible}} via lifts and stairways. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> roofs <b>were</b> renewed from October 2009 to January 2011 and <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> fitted with tactile paving. The station building includes shops and a ticket office. It {{is served by}} the public bus network.|$|R
50|$|Shippō Station has a two opposed side <b>platforms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> not even: <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> for {{trains in}} the {{direction}} of Nagoya is longer, and can accommodate trains of eight carriages in length, whereas <b>the</b> opposing <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> shorter, and can accommodate trains of only up to six carriages. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> connected by a level crossing.|$|R
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service {{began on the}} short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided {{to the north of}} the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to the casual observer. Much of the branch remains including a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> staggered; <b>the</b> {{southbound}} <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{entirely to}} <b>the</b> {{north of the}} Route 62 overpass, while over half of <b>the</b> northbound <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> south of <b>the</b> bridge. A pedestrian crossing between <b>the</b> two <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> located {{just north of the}} bridge; until a path from an adjacent apartment complex opened in 2015, this was the only access to <b>the</b> southbound <b>platform.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Platform</b> 1 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{terminus}} <b>platform</b> {{for some}} southbound trains during peak hours. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> curved and <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> gap <b>is</b> relatively large {{compared to other}} MTR stations.|$|R
50|$|At the Olympic Park {{station in}} Sydney, the loop <b>is</b> {{flattened}} where <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> located, so that <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> faces <b>are</b> straight.|$|R
25|$|Although console-based MMORPGs are {{considered}} {{more difficult to}} produce, <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> gaining more attention.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} to operate {{for at least}} one Earth year, and its instruments might be powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator to provide long-term power.|$|E
25|$|South of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> a {{small set}} of goods sidings which {{currently}} store the TPOs, mineral wagons and other stock {{when they are}} not in use.|$|E
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 3 {{platforms}} and 5 tracks. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> connected by Foot Over Bridge. These <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> built to accumulate 24 coaches express train. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> equipped with modern facility like display board of arrival and departure of trains.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two ground-level side platforms serving two tracks. However, one of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> not normally used. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> connected by an underground passageway. The station has a Midori no Madoguchi staffed ticket office.|$|R
50|$|The toilets {{located on}} {{the north end of}} <b>the</b> Tobu <b>platform</b> <b>were</b> removed in 2013 when <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> {{lengthened}} as part of the work to add lift access to <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} to gain ADA-access, with {{the installation of}} one new elevator, {{as part of the}} 2015–2019 Capital Program. The elevator project, originally {{expected to}} begin in 2018 has been delayed to 2019.|$|E
25|$|The station {{consists}} of a single island platform on a grade-separated embankment. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> located {{on the south side}} of the right of way of Metra's Union Pacific/West Line to the east of Austin Boulevard. It serves the Green Line's two tracks; the northern track serves trains to Harlem/Lake, while the southern track serves trains to Ashland/63rd and Cottage Grove. Fare controls and a customer assistant booth are in the station house, alongside the railroad embankment at street level. Access to <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> provided by a stairwell and an escalator. The station's lack of an elevator or a ramp means that it is not handicapped accessible.|$|E
25|$|In October 2015, Amazon {{announced}} a new handmade marketplace called Handmade By Amazon, already having 5,000 sellers from 60 countries and 80,000 items for sale. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> designed for artisans to sell their good directly to the public, similar to the platform Etsy.|$|E

25|$|South of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> an acqueduct leading {{water to}} large, symmetrical, stepped tank made of granite that was {{excavated}} by archaeologists in the 1980s. The complex has another large water pool—possibly for water sports—a garden and various mandapa. {{there is a}} ruined temple-like monument near the step tank.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s compact chassis {{is derived}} from {{components}} used in the Honda Fit. The structure of the engine compartment and front section of the chassis is almost identical to the Fit’s, but with additional enhancements to aid crash protection. From the firewall aft <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> unique to Insight.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north-east}} of {{the station}} building is a separate men's toilet block, timber framed and clad with chamferboard. It is elevated on concrete stumps and has a skillion roof. A doorway towards <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> shielded by a corrugated iron clad entrance porch, {{and there is a}} glass louvre window on the south-east elevation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> have no columns {{except on}} the north ends, where <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{extended}} in <b>the</b> 1960s to accommodate the current standard B Division train length of 600 feet. These I-beam columns are cream colored. The station was renovated in the 1970s, and during this renovation the original trim line along <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> <b>was</b> replaced with cinder block tiles, which are colored white.
