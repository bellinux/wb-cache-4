5|$|The Sachsen {{class of}} four ships {{was built in}} the late 1870s to early 1880s. The ships—, , , and —were {{designed}} to operate as part of an integrated coastal defense network. The ships were intended to sortie from fortified bases to break up an enemy blockade or landing attempt, and were labeled as Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes) by the Imperial Navy. As a result of their intended roles, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> short cruising radius and were not intended for high-seas operations. Armed with six 26cm guns, they were, however, intended to fight hostile ironclads on relatively equal terms.|$|E

This gained them crucial exposure and attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who signed them to the channel encouraged by their tenacity and their book and internet business.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Compton officiated at {{the wedding}} of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal. Though it was an {{arranged}} marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> set of buildings, known as the Cockpit, in the Palace of Whitehall as their London residence, and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne's ladies of the bedchamber. Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant, but the baby was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, {{and over the next}} two years, gave birth to two daughters in quick succession: Mary and Anne Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{seven months}} in Mexico, Middleton's return to Galveston brought a special anticipation. He had {{proposed}} to Jerusha Collins {{at an earlier}} time, and renewed the proposal upon his return. The couple was married on 6 January 1915, and this allowed them to be in New Orleans two days later {{with other members of}} Middleton's unit for the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in which the 7th Regiment had served a century earlier. After a week in New Orleans, the couple returned to Galveston, and were invited to move into the Hagemann's house, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> large upstairs room.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding {{to the effects of}} radiation sickness.|$|E

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for {{the lifting of the}} ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|The Mogador-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} for anti-surface warfare rather than anti-submarine work and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> large torpedo battery in consequence. Two triple Modèle 1928T torpedo launchers were fitted on each beam between the funnels and two twin Modèle 1928D launchers were located on the beam, abaft the second funnel. The placement of each launcher on the beam significantly increased each launcher's arc of fire (25° to 150°) {{in comparison to the}} Le Fantastaques centerline mount (60°-100°). However this was not without cost as her torpedo broadside was weaker by one tube than the older class, but the extra launchers positioned close to the ship's side imposed, more importantly, a weight and stability penalty.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Before {{they formed}} a partnership, John Morrison and The Miz were opponents, {{competing}} for the ECW Championship in October 2007. On the November 16, 2007, episode of SmackDown!, then-rivals Morrison and The Miz were paired together to face Matt Hardy and MVP in a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which they subsequently won after MVP turned on Hardy. After winning the title, Morrison and The Miz brought the title to the ECW brand. Soon after winning the WWE Tag Team Championship, the two were no longer portrayed as enemies, but rather as trusting friends. They would defend the title on numerous occasions on both ECW and SmackDown as well as multiple pay-per-views against opponents like Shannon Moore and Jimmy Wang Yang, Jesse and Festus, and Tommy Dreamer and Colin Delaney. The team's gimmick was further expanded upon when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> show on WWE.com called The Dirt Sheet. During the sixth annual WWE Draft on June 23, 2008, on Monday Night Raw, the duo defeated the Hardys (Matt and Jeff) which earned ECW its only draft pick, {{which turned out to}} be Matt Hardy. At the Great American Bash in July, Morrison and The Miz lost the title in a four team tag match to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder; however, neither The Miz nor Morrison were pinned during the match.|$|E

25|$|Captain Jim Collins and {{co-pilot}} Greg Cassin {{had never}} flown to Antarctica before, {{but they were}} experienced pilots and were considered qualified for the flight.

5000|$|The {{perfection}} bonus {{takes into}} account how many cube rolls it took to clear all the cubes.

If the player clears the cubes in exactly this number of rolls (Perfect in Kurushi Final), <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Brilliant" [...] bonus of 5,000 points.
