5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater at the end of <b>the</b> <b>penis,</b> a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to <b>the</b> <b>penis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>penis</b> {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater at the end of <b>the</b> <b>penis,</b> a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>penises</b> of some {{bird species}} feature spines and brush-like filaments.|$|R
50|$|The bulbus glandis also {{occurs in}} <b>the</b> <b>penises</b> of some pinnipeds, {{including}} South American fur seals.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> glans <b>penis</b> (or simply glans, [...] ) is the {{sensitive}} bulbous structure at the distal end of <b>the</b> human <b>penis.</b> <b>The</b> glans is anatomically homologous to the clitoral glans {{of the human}} female.|$|R
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> and anus forming a like shape, <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are injected into <b>the</b> <b>penis.</b> This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old male {{presented}} with an asymptomatic papulo-pustular eruption over <b>the</b> glans <b>penis.</b> <b>The</b> clinical features and investigations were suggestive of papulonecrotic tuberculids of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis.</b> He had an underlying bilateral active tuberculous epididymo-orchitis and a healed focus of pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R
50|$|The {{epithelium}} of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> is mucocutaneous tissue. Birley et al. {{report that}} excessive washing with soap may dry the mucous membrane that covers <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> and cause non-specific dermatitis.|$|R
40|$|Ischemia of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> {{is a rare}} postcircumcision complication. We {{describe}} a four-year-old boy developing ischemia of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> 48 [*]h after circumcision. The ischemia completely resolved following treatment with iv pentoxifylline (PTX) for six days, and the patient was discharged without any problems. PTX treatment {{should be kept in}} mind as an alternative treatment modality in ischemia of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> which is a serious potential post-circumcision complication...|$|R
5|$|Inside the pudendal canal, {{the nerve}} divides into branches, first giving off the {{inferior}} rectal nerve, then the perineal nerve, before continuing as the dorsal nerve of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> (in males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into <b>the</b> <b>penis,</b> making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
50|$|Body count {{figures have}} a long history in {{military}} planning and propaganda. In ancient battles, <b>the</b> <b>penises</b> (and sometimes <b>the</b> scrotums as well) of killed and dying enemies were collected from the field to count the dead.|$|R
50|$|The {{record for}} <b>the</b> largest <b>penis</b> to body size ratio {{is held by}} the barnacle. <b>The</b> barnacle's <b>penis</b> can grow to up to forty times its own body length. This enables them to reach the nearest female.|$|R
50|$|It pierces the {{inferior}} fascia, and, entering <b>the</b> crus <b>penis</b> obliquely, runs {{forward in the}} center of <b>the</b> corpus cavernosum <b>penis,</b> to which its branches are distributed.|$|R
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of <b>the</b> <b>penis.</b> The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
40|$|Genital tubercles of {{male and}} female rats were cultured beneath the renal capsule of {{castrated}} and intact adult male rats treated with androgens, oestrogen, or anti-androgen, and the development of <b>the</b> os <b>penis</b> in <b>the</b> transplants was studied. When the genital tubercles were cultured in normal male hosts, a membrane bone and a hyaline cartilage of the proximal segment of <b>the</b> os <b>penis</b> were formed 8 - 11 days after transplantation, and a fibrocartilage of the distal segment of <b>the</b> os <b>penis</b> at 11 - 14 days. In genital tubercles cultured in castrated males, the rudiments of both the proximal and distal segments remained as undifferentiated mesenchymal cell masses. However, similarly cultured genital tubercles were found to develop cartilages and bone when the hosts were treated with high doses of androgens. The potency of androgen-dependent chondrogenesis and osteogenesis was equivalent in the male and female genital tubercles. Chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of <b>the</b> os <b>penis</b> were caused by androgens, while the rudiments of <b>the</b> os <b>penis</b> were formed independently of androgens. The overt differentiation of <b>the</b> corpus cavernosum <b>penis</b> was also caused by androgens...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{retractor}} <b>penis</b> muscle {{occurs in}} marsupials and carnivorans, {{but it is}} absent in humans. A stag's penis forms an S-shaped curve {{when it is not}} erect, and is retracted into its preputial sheath by <b>the</b> retractor <b>penis</b> muscle.|$|R
25|$|At birth, {{the inner}} {{layer of the}} {{foreskin}} is sealed to <b>the</b> glans <b>penis.</b> <b>The</b> foreskin is usually non-retractable in early childhood, and can be as late as 18.|$|R
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>penis,</b> the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at <b>the</b> <b>penis.</b> As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part {{of the end of the}} vesicular gland is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft {{on the underside of}} the second segment contains a pair of claspers and <b>the</b> <b>penis.</b> The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is {{on the underside of the}} eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
50|$|In the Sa language, gol {{refers to}} both the tower and the land dive. The tower symbolically {{represents}} a body, with a head, shoulders, breasts, belly, genitals, and knees. The diving platforms represent <b>the</b> <b>penises</b> and <b>the</b> struts beneath represent the vaginas.|$|R
50|$|Male felids {{are able}} to urinate {{backwards}} by curving the tip of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> backward. In cats, <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> is covered with spines, but in dogs, the glans is smooth. Penile spines also occur on the glans {{of male and female}} spotted hyenas.|$|R
5000|$|A 1974 {{report by}} Seth B. Goldsmith, SCD noted [...] "The Tucker {{telephone}} not only shocked <b>the</b> <b>penises</b> of <b>the</b> allegedly uncooperative and incorrigible prison-farm inmates of the Arkansas penal system, but it shocked {{the consciousness of}} the nation and awakened it to the atrocious conditions inside prisons." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{band had}} also {{incurred}} heavy legal expenses for <b>the</b> <b>Penis</b> Envy prosecution; this, combined with exhaustion and {{the pressures of}} living and operating together, finally took its toll. On 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on the return trip guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of <b>the</b> <b>penis,</b> and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different {{versions of the same}} structure).|$|E
5|$|The fossa {{has several}} scent glands, {{although}} the glands are less developed in females. Like herpestids {{it has a}} perianal skin gland inside an anal sac which surrounds the anus like a pocket. The pocket opens to the exterior with a horizontal slit below the tail. Other glands are located near <b>the</b> <b>penis</b> or vagina, with the penile glands emitting a strong odor. Like the herpestids, it has no prescrotal glands.|$|E
40|$|Ischemic {{complications}} of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> are rare and commonly result from trauma, inadvertent administration of vasoconstrictive solutions, diabetes mellitus, circumcision and vasculitis; we refer {{about a young}} man with severe ischemia of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> following circumcision. <b>The</b> patient had undergone circumcision 5 days before in a surgery department under local anesthesia (1 % mepivacaine hydrochloride). The patient noticed a brownish color and edema of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis</b> at 24 h after he opened the wound dressing, but arrived to our hospital only 5 days after circumcision because these findings had progressed. Physical examination revealed the black color or necrotic appearance of <b>the</b> glans <b>penis,</b> and edema on the dorsal penile skin. The patient underwent antibiotic, antiplatatelet, corticosteroid and iperbaric therapy achieving a complete restitutio ad integrum...|$|R

50|$|Length of <b>the</b> flaccid <b>penis</b> {{does not}} {{necessarily}} correspond to length of the erect penis; some smaller flaccid penises grow much longer, while some larger flaccid penises grow comparatively less. Among all primates, <b>the</b> human <b>penis</b> is <b>the</b> largest in girth, but comparable to chimpanzees and certain other species in length.|$|R
