5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse.

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when <b>temperatures</b> <b>are</b> low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
