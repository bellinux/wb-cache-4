5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
5|$|A maximum {{wind gust}} of 158km/h (98mph) was {{recorded}} on Cairn Gorm, Scotland as Katia impacted the region, with a peak gust of 130km/h (81mph) observed at a non-mountain station in Capel Curig, Wales; these observations marked the strongest impact from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Lili in 1996. Waves up to 15meters (49ft) battered the western coastline of Ireland, and fallen power lines temporarily disrupted DART services. Approximately 4,000 households were left without power across the country. A catering marquee was blown {{into the air}} on a set for the television series Game of Thrones, causing one injury. In County Durham, United Kingdom, a man was killed after a tree fell on <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> he was driving; the passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A second driver was indirectly killed on the M54 motorway after hazardous weather caused a multi-car accident. Farther south in Bradford, an 11-year-old boy was injured after {{he was hit by}} a portion of a roof blown off a garage. Downed power poles set several fields on fire. The second stage of the Tour of Britain was forcefully canceled after strong winds littered the cycle route with debris. Following the storm, damage estimates in the United Kingdom alone topped Â£100m ($157 million 2011 USD). The remnants of Katia produced damage as far east as Russia. In St. Petersburg, wind gusts up to 45mph (75km/h) damaged buildings and left roughly 1,500 residents without power. In Estonia, the storm cut off power to approximately 940 households, particularly affecting the island of Hiiumaa and Harju County, with strong winds in coastal areas gusting up to 90km/h (55mph).|$|E
25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>Minivan</b> was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted {{to the rear}} compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear door facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and <b>the</b> <b>Minivan.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rogers' next {{assignment}} was as {{commanding officer of}} the United States Navy Tactical Training Group at Point Loma, a group responsible for training officers in handling combat situations. He retired from the United States Navy in August 1991. In 1992, Rogers and his wife Sharon co-wrote a book, Storm Center: A Personal Account of Tragedy & Terrorism which describes the events surrounding the downing of Iran Air 655 and <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> bombing from their personal perspectives.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber {{to put on his}} explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E

As Williams had not obtained German work permits, they were detained at Harwich for five hours. Williams finally convinced the authorities that they were students on holiday, although work permits were later obtained after their arrival in Hamburg.|$|E
50|$|The 41AE is {{a variant}} of the 41TE that was {{originally}} used for the all-wheel drive variants of <b>the</b> <b>minivans,</b> and was also used for the Chrysler Pacifica from its 2004-model-year introduction until the model was discontinued in 2008.|$|R

500|$|The song [...] "Ode to Branson," [...] {{which is}} {{performed}} by several [...] "washed-up" [...] celebrities, was composed by Alf Clausen and written by Vitti. Even though Vitti received sole credit for writing the song, {{parts of the}} lyrics were written by Simpsons writer Carolyn Omine, which were then revised by fellow writer Matt Selman. Selman was especially satisfied with the rhyme sung by Mr. T; he stated that whenever he feels down, he thinks of that rhyme and that it [...] "boosts [...] up inside." [...] The episode features American actress Olympia Dukakis as Grampa's love interest Zelda. American comedian Bill Saluga also makes an appearance, as his television character Ray J. Johnson. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> is portrayed by series regular Hank Azaria, who imitated the voice of Clark Gable for the character.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>minivan</b> driver {{fled the}} scene on foot, but was later arrested and {{identified}} as Andrew Thomas Gallo. On May 27, 2009, Gallo was indicted by the Orange County grand jury on three counts of murder, one count each of felony hit-and-run, {{driving under the influence}} and causing injury, and driving with a [...]08 percent blood alcohol or higher and causing injury and death. Gallo had a blood alcohol content of [...]19 percent two hours after the crash, and was also driving with a suspended license. On June 8, 2009, Gallo entered a not guilty plea at his arraignment. After a two-week jury trial held in September 2010, Gallo was convicted on three counts of second-degree murder, two counts of driving under the influence causing great bodily injury, and one felony count of hit-and-run. A bench trial found Gallo guilty of driving on a suspended license. On December 22, 2010, Gallo was sentenced to 51 years to life in jail.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in <b>the</b> <b>minivan</b> with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
50|$|This {{engine was}} Chrysler's first 60Â° V6 engine {{designed}} and built in-house for front wheel drive vehicles, and their first V6 not based on a V8. It {{was designed as a}} larger, more powerful option to the Mitsubishi 3.0 V6 in <b>the</b> <b>minivans</b> and debuted in 1990.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Chrysler {{designed}} the A404 TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transaxle for its {{front wheel drive}} Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars. This transaxle would be upgraded in the 1980s into the A413 and A670 units, which were progressively heavier-duty, for Chrysler's K-cars and their derivatives, including <b>the</b> <b>minivans.</b> <b>The</b> four-speed Ultradrive electronic four-speed automatic transaxle would eventually replace it, but the three-speed lasted {{for more than a}} decade after the 1989 debut of the four-speed unit.|$|R

[...] <b>The</b> <b>minivan</b> was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes.

2500|$|Chrysler {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>minivan,</b> chiefly Sperlich's [...] "baby", in late 1983. [...] It led {{the automobile}} industry in sales for 25 years.

2500|$|Also from Ford, Iacocca {{brought to}} Chrysler the [...] "Mini-Max" [...] project, which, in 1983, bore fruit {{in the highly}} {{successful}} Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager.

The first generation Ridgeline is more aptly classified as a sport utility truck with its rivals being the full-size Chevrolet Avalanche and the smaller Ford Explorer Sport Trac, leaving the Ridgeline as the mid-size option of the three SUTs. [...] According to Bloomberg, Honda hoped buyers would find it an attractive alternative to large SUVs and conventional pickup trucks.|$|E
2500|$|Iacocca {{participated in}} the design of several {{successful}} Ford automobiles, most notably the Ford Mustang, the Lincoln Continental Mark III, the Ford Escort and the revival of the Mercury brand in the late 1960s, including the introduction of the Mercury Cougar and Mercury Marquis.

2500|$|They {{learn that}} Chow {{had lied to}} them; the villa was never his. In fact, it was Marshall's own villa and the gold they stole was the other half Chow didn't get from Marshall. Marshall forgives them for their mistake but kills [...] "Black Doug" [...] for his {{incompetence}} and reminds them of their now two-day deadline. The group tracks Phil's phone, which was left in <b>the</b> <b>minivan,</b> outside a pawn shop in Las Vegas. The pawnshop owner, Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), tells them that Chow traded a gold brick for $18,000, far less than its usual sell rate of $400,000. Using Stu's former lover Jade (Heather Graham) as their contact, they learn that Chow is barricaded in the penthouse suite of Caesars Palace. Phil and Alan sneak into his suite from the roof, but Chow escapes, jumping from the balcony and parachuting down to the Strip. Stu catches up to Chow and locks him {{in the trunk of}} the limo that Marshall lent to them. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug back to the group. Although Marshall initially promised not to harm Chow, he shoots through the trunk of the car, presumably killing him. However, Alan had given Chow the means to escape from the trunk through a backseat compartment just moments earlier.|$|E

Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying. Umpire Simon Taufel also said that the umpire's minibus was abandoned while the players' bus was moved to the ground to evacuate the players. [...] Slamming the security entourage for abandoning them and inability of the police to arrest the attackers Simon said,"You tell me why no one was caught. You tell me why. Supposedly 25 armed commandos were in our convoy, and when the team bus got going again, we were left on our own." [...] Co-umpire Steve Davis said [...] "he felt let down" [...] by the security.

'It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials,' the outraged Manuel said. Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security.
