5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction.

The Stalinist government ordered {{the construction of the}} country's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta.

5|$|Among the downsides <b>to</b> <b>rapid</b> {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced particulate {{air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and {{ranching}} were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led <b>to</b> <b>rapid</b> industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, the value of petroleum and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded the value of all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew by less than 24 times during the same period.|$|E

Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye.

5|$|In 1935, {{work began}} on the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would develop the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems for {{irrigation}} of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945, the state experienced an economic boom that led <b>to</b> <b>rapid</b> urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California's economy could not depend solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California's water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E

In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading.

This storm traveled {{in a similar fashion}} to Kanoa in response to a high pressure system over the northern Pacific. By August9, the system turned northwest and weakened. Cold, dry air began to enter the storm as it accelerated over cooler waters. Several reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm due <b>to</b> <b>rapid</b> changes in the storm's wind field and structure.

5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due <b>to</b> <b>rapid</b> cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
