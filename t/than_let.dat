5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball {{over the head of}} UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed <b>than</b> <b>let</b> their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans first landed 15 {{miles west}} of Canea (Chania), where the local militia fled before them. They then {{attacked}} the small island fortress of St. Todero, the commander of which, the Istrian Blasio Zulian, blew himself, the fortress and its garrison up rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> it fall to the Ottomans. The Ottoman army next advanced {{to the city of}} Canea itself, which fell on 22 August, after a siege that lasted for 56 days. At the same time, however, the Venetians were strengthened, as the promised help started to arrive in the form of galleys from the Papal States, Tuscany, Malta and Naples. In September, the Ottoman fleet was in disarray, but the allied Christian fleet, under the cautious command of Niccolò Ludovisi, the Pope's nephew, failed to exploit the opportunity for a decisive strike. When the Christian forces finally moved to retake Canea on 1 October, with a fleet of about 90 ships, the stout Ottoman defense and the Allies' lack of cooperation doomed the attack. Soon thereafter, the Venetian allies returned to their bases.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|An Ipsos-Reid poll {{suggested}} that if an election had been held on December 5, the Conservatives would have received 46% of the vote, enough to have easily formed a majority government.

25|$|On 1 September 2011, {{it became}} public that an {{encrypted}} version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of unredacted U.S. State Department cables had been available via BitTorrent {{for months and}} that the decryption key (similar to a password) was available to those who knew where to find it. Guardian newspaper editor David Leigh had just published the decryption key in his book, so the files were now publicly available to anyone. Rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> malicious actors publish selected data, WikiLeaks decided to publish the entire, unredacted archive in searchable form on its website.|$|E
25|$|With his vessels {{effectively}} trapped, Porter sent {{an urgent}} appeal {{for help to}} the Army, and then issued orders to his captains to prepare to destroy their ships rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> them fall into enemy hands. The soldiers, with the personal prodding of Major General William T. Sherman, made a forced march that got to the flotilla on March 22. They easily drove off the Confederate patrols that were blocking the retreat, so Porter and his vessels were able to move back into Steele's Bayou. By March 27, the entire expedition {{was back on the}} Mississippi, having accomplished nothing.|$|E

25|$|Charlton Heston played More {{in several}} {{versions}} of the play-off-Broadway in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it on the West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favourite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a wig over his hairpiece, rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> the public view his actual bald pate.|$|E
25|$|The 4th-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus left a {{detailed}} record of some Greek influences and innovations in viticulture, {{one of which}} was the study of vineyard soils and their proper match to specific grapevines. Another innovation was the minimization of yields for more intense concentration of flavors and quality, rather than increased quantity. The economics of the time favored high yields for most crops, and intentionally limiting agricultural output was exceedingly uncommon in the ancient world. Theophrastus also detailed the practice of using suckering and plant cuttings for new vineyard plantings. The Greeks also employed vine training with stacked plants for easier cultivation and harvesting, rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> the grapevines grow untrained in bushes or up trees.|$|E

25|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in 1483 and was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son Edward V.

Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, were taken to the Tower of London, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Who was responsible for their ultimate fate remains a topic of heated discussion to this day. There is evidence that some coins were struck for King Edward V, but it is uncertain that any have survived.|$|E
25|$|These {{systems were}} {{the subject of}} a {{comprehensive}} stall programme, involving some 3,500 stalls being performed by Hawker Siddeley before the matter was considered resolved by the Air Registration Board. The stall warning and recovery systems tended to over-react: of ten activations between the Trident entering service and June 1972, only half were genuine, although in the previous 6½ years there had been no false activations when an aircraft was actually in the air. When BEA Trident pilots were questioned informally by one captain, over half of the pilots said that they would disable the protection systems on activation rather <b>than</b> <b>let</b> them recover the aircraft to a safe attitude. Random checks carried out by the airline after the accident showed that this was not the case; 21 captains stated that they had witnessed their co-pilots react correctly to any stall warnings.|$|E

The court did not vacate Douglas' stay until noon on Friday, June 19. The execution was now scheduled for 11 p.m. that evening, which was after the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The Rosenbergs' lawyer, Emmanual Bloch, desperately played for more time and filed a complaint that this offended their Jewish heritage. This argument was also made in front of Judge Kaufman by attorney Rhoda Laks, who was also part of the Rosenberg defense team. The play backfired and the execution was rescheduled for 8pm, which was before sunset and earlier than 11pm., which was the regular time for executions at Sing Sing.|$|E
