500|$|Roger Ebert {{was among}} those who {{strongly}} supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for [...] "its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of how I felt <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way".|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. I remember <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E
500|$|Wagner had {{completed}} Rienzi in 1840. With the strong support of Giacomo Meyerbeer, it was accepted for {{performance by the}} Dresden Court Theatre (Hofoper) in the Kingdom of Saxony and in 1842, Wagner moved to Dresden. His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his [...] "Autobiographic Sketch" [...] of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, [...] "For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Rhine—with hot tears in my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland." [...] Rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October.|$|E
6000|$|Now, here's {{something}} else I remember. It's about <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole a watermelon. [...] "Stole" [...] {{is a strong}} word. Stole? Stole? No, I don't mean that. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever withdrew a watermelon. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever extracted a watermelon. That is exactly the word I want--"extracted." [...] It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly conveys my idea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning I am looking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.|$|R

When Berg was eight, his family relocated to Los Angeles, California. While a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School, Berg researched the author F. Scott Fitzgerald (a favorite of Barbara's, who named her son in part after Fitzgerald) for a report and [...] "developed a mania" [...] for his writing. Berg read all of Fitzgerald's works and later recalled: [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the fusion of an artist and his life, a tragic and romantic life." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing about The Year of the Sex Olympics in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith {{felt that}} Kneale {{was one of}} the few {{television}} writers whose work was particularly memorable. Once upon a time, Lord Hailsham, proceeding to the chamber of the House in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as Lord High Chancellor, spotted a friend and cried lustily, [...] "Neil!" [...] They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last night... last year... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> The Year of the Sex Olympics by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.|$|E
500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E

Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote [...] "I ... recall <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of.

2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through... about 25 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, roughly 50 million Americans—half the {{population}} at that time—attended the movies every week. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a [...] "boy" [...] in her old gang became [...] "impossible". She {{did not have any}} girlfriends, and school was a [...] "heartache" [...] and her home was [...] "miserable." [...] On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life I knew there was beauty in the world. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> distant lands, serene, lovely homes, romance, nobility, glamor". And further; [...] "I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass." [...] At 16, Bow says she [...] "knew" [...] she wanted to be a motion pictures actress, even if she was a [...] "square, awkward, funny-faced kid." ...|$|E

[...] When Albarn went to a landfill outside London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [...] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish. [...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E
