This resulted {{in the development of a}} dedicated antitank warhead that replaced the steel rod in the practice warhead with a <b>tungsten</b> <b>rod.</b> This new antitank warhead could penetrate a Soviet T-72 main battle tank armour from any attack angle. Further study into this effect led to the WDU-5002/B FAT warhead, Flechette Anti-Tank, containing five tungsten-reinforced steel flechettes that could penetrate a T-72's side and top armour at a distance of 10000 ft. It was also found to be a useful warhead for use against medium and light armoured vehicles. Further development led to the WDU-500X/B [...] "General Purpose Flechette" [...] which releases 80 tungsten flechettes that can penetrate 1.5 inches of roll-hardened armor for use against personnel, some light armour, thin skin vehicles and helicopters.|$|E

30|$|The <b>tungsten</b> <b>rod</b> is {{connected}} to the positive pole of a power supply with the maximum output of 30 V and 3 A. There are two stainless steel (SS) tubes placed in the beaker. By placing the graphite cathode outside the large SS tube, we prevent the <b>tungsten</b> <b>rod</b> from the electrolyte turbulence. The smaller SS tube is used to protect the down-piece when it falls down. We also use a non-reactive plastic tube to control the etching speed. Inside the plastic tube, the etching speed is significantly suppressed. We adjust the etching length of the electrode by varying the length of the rod {{in and out of the}} plastic tube. With this design, the etching speed can be adjusted, allowing us to fabricate the electrodes with controllable length-to-diameter ratios.|$|E

30|$|A typical {{experimental}} {{procedure is}} described as follows. We first mill and polish the <b>tungsten</b> <b>rod</b> to a right size. Then the rod surface is pre-cleaned by sodium hydroxide solution. The <b>tungsten</b> <b>rod</b> is carefully aligned {{so that it is}} perpendicular to the solution surface. We adjust the length immersed into solution so that it is slightly longer than the desired electrode length (e.g. 42 mm rod immersed into solution for 41 mm long electrode). After the etching starts, we adjust the position of the plastic tube to control the etching speed. In the end, the rod is etched into two pieces and the down-piece falls, which self-terminates the etching process. The down-piece is then taken out and washed by distill water before it is stored in an argon gas box. The argon gas prevents the freshly-etched surface of the needle electrode from oxidizing. Following the fabrication, we use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the dependence of surface morphology on the etching parameters.|$|E

Previous work showed that the mechanical properties of tungsten are degraded from irradiation in a neutron flux but little work had been performed on the irradiation of tungsten in a high energy proton beam. In this study, <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> were irradiated at the 800 MeV Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) proton accelerator for six months. To avoid corrosion during irradiation, the rods were clad with a thin (0. 25 mm thick) 304 L or (0. 125 mm thick) annealed alloy 718 tubing. After irradiation to a maximum dose in the tungsten of 23. 3 dpa, the clad rods were opened in the hot cells and the tungsten was removed.

40|$|In this paper, a {{practical}} micromachining technology {{was applied for}} the fabrication of a micro probe using a complex nontraditional machining process. A series process was combined to machine <b>tungsten</b> carbide <b>rods</b> from original dimension.

High-aspect-ratio of micro <b>tungsten</b> carbide <b>rod</b> was easily obtained by this process.

50|$|Because {{the density}} is so {{similar to that}} of gold ({{tungsten}} is only 0.36% less dense), tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold, which has been observed since the 1980s, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods.</b> The densities are not exactly the same, and other properties of gold and tungsten differ, but gold-plated tungsten will pass superficial tests.|$|R
40|$|The {{vaporization}} {{of tungsten}} from the APT spallation target dominates the radiological source term for unmitigated target overheating accidents. Chemical reactions of tungsten with steam which persist to tungsten temperatures {{as low as}} 800 C result {{in the formation of}} a hydrated tungsten-oxide which has a high vapor pressure and is readily convected in a flowing atmosphere. This low-temperature vaporization reaction essentially removes the oxide film that forms on the tungsten-metal surface as soon as it forms, leaving behind a fresh metallic surface for continued oxidation and vaporization. Experiments were conducted to measure the oxidative vaporization rates of tungsten in steam as part of the effort to quantify the MT radiological source term for severe target accidents. Tests were conducted with <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> (1 / 8 inch diameter, six inches long) heated to temperatures from approximately 700 C to 1350 C in flowing steam which was superheated to 140 C. A total of 19 experiments was conducted. Fifteen tests were conducted by RF induction heating of single <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> held vertical in a quartz glass retort. Four tests were conducted in a vertically-mounted tube furnace for the low temperature range of the test series. The aerosol which was generated and transported downstream from the <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> was collected by passing the discharged steam through a condenser. This procedure insured total collection of the steam along with the aerosol from the vaporization of the rods. The results of these experiments revealed a threshold temperature for tungsten vaporization in steam. For the two tests at the lowest temperatures which were tested, approximately 700 C, the <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> were observed to oxidize without vaporization. The remainder of the tests was conducted over the temperature range of 800 C to 1350 C. In these tests, the rods were found to have lost weight due to vaporization of the tungsten and the missing weight was collected in the downstream condensate system. The aerosol formed a fine white smoke of tungsten-oxide which was visible to the eye as it condensed in the laminar boundary layer of steam which flowed along the surface of the rod. The aerosol continued to flow as a smoke tube downstream of the rod, flowing coaxially along the centerline axis of the quartz glass tube and depositing by impaction along the outside of a bend and at sudden area contractions in the piping. The vaporization rate data from the 17 experiments which exceeded the vaporization threshold temperature are shown in Figure 5 in the form of vaporization rates (g/cm{sup 2 } s) vs. inverse temperature (K{sup {minus} 1 }). Two correlations to the present data are presented and compared to a published correlation by Kilpatrick and Lott. The differences are discussed...|$|R

The two major techniques used are Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD). These can result in the deposition of two-dimensional blanket or patterned thin films.

50|$|The typical {{depiction}} of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of <b>tungsten</b> <b>rods</b> and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the satellite would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the target. As the rod approaches periapsis and the target due to gravity, it picks up immense speed until it begins decelerating in the atmosphere and reaches terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would typically be shaped to minimize air resistance and maximize terminal velocity.
