The Company has successfully drilled and completed 11 horizontal wells at MangalaMangala field is producing at plateau rates; infill wells are planned this year for sustaining and extending plateau andgoing forward, the Company intends <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> other wells <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> in a staged manner. Bhagyam: Bhagyam is the second largest field in the Rajasthan block, with an approved production plateau of 40,000 bopd. A total of 62 development wells have been drilled till date with 21 producers and four injectors operational; 12 producer wells are yet to be drilled.Bhagyam field is expected to ramp up to approved rate in H2 FY2013-14; and additional wells are planned this year. Both Mangala and Bhagyam {{are connected to the}} Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT), which processes the crude oil from the Rajasthan fields.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{different}} {{systems for the}} generation, transmission and distribution of energy is {{at the base of}} any advanced society. They provide the basic resources for industrial production, transport and domestic needs. Thus, energy resources in terms of available fuels and reliable infrastructure are needed. On the other hand, they involve hazardous activities that pose a threat to public health and environment. During the last years a lot of attention has been paid by regulators, utilities, environmental groups and the general public to risk issues related {{to the use of the}} different types of energy systems across the different steps in their fuel and life cycle chains. At European level, the increasing intensity of external energy dependence (EU 27 energy dependence rate is 54 % in 2006 in 2006 (Eurostat, 2008)) - partly from regions threatened by insecurity (Green Paper, 2006) - together with the recent instability of oil prices [1], call for the implementation of renewable and alternative energy systems. Europe is acting with an increasing involvement in energy issues. The European Community legislation in force concerning energy already consists of 350 acts (Directives, Regulations, Decisions, etc) (European Community Eur-Lex, 2008). A diversification of energy sources with the promotion of the development of new and sustainable energy technologies (e. g., Directive 2001 / 77 /EC on the promotion of the electricity produces from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, and Directive 2004 / 8 /EC on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market), is necessary to increase security and stability of energy supply to customers. Anyhow, action is urgent: it takes many years <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> innovation <b>on</b> <b>streams</b> in the energy sector. Promotion of energy diversity - type, country of origin and transit - must be continuous. This approach will create the conditions for growth, jobs, greater security and a better environment. Work has been progressing on these issues since the Commission's 2000 Green Paper on Security of Energy Supply, but given recent developments on energy markets, a new European impetus is needed. JRC.

40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{starting}} a non-flowing well is the background for this project. This is a concern, mainly for offshore and subsea completed wells. Typically, coiled tubing (CT) is run into the production tubing to a depth approximately 1000 m below the wellhead. Nitrogen gas is then injected through the CT to dilute the wellfluid and reduce the hydrostatic pressure in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the well <b>on</b> <b>stream.</b> This is a high cost operation due to the large intervention unit needed and the time required. In addition, HMS is a concern with gas lift operations due to the high pressure nitrogen gas used. This thesis has proposed a design based on using a wireline (WL) powered pump {{as an alternative to}} CT. The pump was designed using computer-aided design (CAD). Finite element method (FEM) analyzes of critical parts was performed to verify the structural integrity. The design is based on a using slightly modified conventional surface WL winch system In addition, known principle of downhole completion and pump components were used. The pump concept created may also be deployed using a riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessel. The design proposed can be used for 7 inch and 5 &# 189; inch tubing. The length of the pump is 16 meters and fits with standard lubricator lengths of 20 meters. The design is based on the sucker rod pump principle. To further study the potential of the pump, dynamic simulations were performed. The intention was to simulate the pump cycle to analyze the performance of the system. Results from the simulations verified that the WL operated pump has an economical potential compared to CT. The time consumption <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the well back <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> was 158 minutes for a 7 inch tubing and 92 minutes for a 5 &# 189; inch tubing. Compared with CT, the potential savings for a subsea completed well could be in the order of 2, 5 MUSD. The overall conclusion is that a WL powered pump system can be used for startup of non-flowing wells. Further work will be needed for automation of the WL winch system. This is important for optimizing and better control of the pump system. </p...|$|R
