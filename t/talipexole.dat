5000|$|<b>Talipexole</b> (B-HT920, Domnin) is a {{dopamine}} agonist that is {{marketed as}} a treatment for Parkinson's Disease in Japan by Boehringer Ingelheim; it was introduced in 1996. [...] As of December 2014 it was not approved for marketing in the US nor in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of human}} {{neuroblastoma}} SH-SY 5 Y cells with 1 mM 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP 1) for 3 days induced pro-duction of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS), followed by caspase- 3 activation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and apoptotic cell death with DNA fragmentation and characteristic morphological changes (condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei). Simultaneous treatment with 1 mM <b>talipexole</b> slightly inhibited the MPP 1 -induced ROS production and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, pretreatment with 1 mM <b>talipexole</b> for 4 days markedly protected the cells against MPP 1 -induced apoptosis. However, this protective effect might not be mediated by dopamine receptors. The <b>talipexole</b> pretreatment induced an increase in antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 protein level but {{had no effect on}} levels of proapoptotic Bax, Bak, an...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} functional responses to ropinirole, its major metabolites in man (SKF- 104557 (4 -[2 -(propylamino) ethyl]- 2 -(3 H) indolone), SKF- 97930 (4 -carboxy- 2 -(3 H) indolone)) and other dopamine receptor agonists at human dopamine D 2 (long) (hD 2), D 3 (hD 3) and D 4. 4 (hD 4) receptors separately expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using microphysiometry. All the receptor agonists tested (ropinirole, SKF- 104557, SKF- 97930, bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide, pramipexole, <b>talipexole,</b> dopamine) increased extracellular acidification rate in Chinese hamster ovary clones expressing the human D 2, D 3 or D 4 receptor. The pEC 50 s of ropinirole at hD 2, hD 3 and hD 4 receptors were 7. 4, 8. 4 and 6. 8, respectively. Ropinirole is therefore at least 10 fold selective for the human dopamine D 3 receptor over the other D 2 receptor family members. At the hD 2 and hD 3 dopamine receptors all the compounds tested were full agonists as compared to quinpirole. <b>Talipexole</b> and the ropinirole metabolite, SKF- 104557, were partial agonists at the hD 4 receptor. Bromocriptine and lisuride had a slow onset of agonist action which precluded determination of EC 50 s. The rank order of agonist potencies was dissimilar to the rank order of radioligand binding affinities at each of the dopamine receptor subtypes. Functional selectivities of the dopamine receptor agonists, as measured in the microphysiometer, were less than radioligand binding selectivities. The results show that ropinirole is a full agonist at human D 2, D 3 and D 4 dopamine receptors. SKF- 104557 the major human metabolite of ropinirole, had similar radioligand binding affinities to, but lower functional potencies than, the parent compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{accompanying}} {{multivariate analysis}} of the binding profiles of antiparkinson agents revealed contrasting patterns of affinities at diverse classes of monoaminergic receptor. Herein, we charac-terized efficacies at human (h) D 2 SHORT(S), hD 2 LONG(L), hD 3, and hD 4. 4 receptors and at h 2 A-, h 2 B-, h 2 C-, and h 1 A-adrenocep-tors (ARs). As determined by guanosine 5 -O-(3 -[35 S]thio) triphos-phate ([35 S]GTPS) binding, no ligand displayed “full ” efficacy relative to dopamine (100 %) at all “D 2 -like ” sites. However, at hD 2 S receptors quinpirole, pramipexole, ropinirole, quinerolane, pergolide, and cabergoline were as efficacious as dopamine (Emax 100 %); TL 99, <b>talipexole,</b> and apomorphine were highly ef-ficacious (79 – 92 %); piribedil, lisuride, bromocriptine, and ter-guride showed intermediate efficacy (40 – 55 %); and roxindole dis-played low efficacy (11 %). For all drugs, efficacies were lower a...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} {{of a range}} of agonists at D 2 (long) dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells have been determined in ligand binding and in a functional assay, the stimulation of [35 S]-GTPγS binding. For several agonists (apomorphine, dopamine, pergolide, quinpirole, NPA, ropinirole, <b>talipexole)</b> binding in the absence of added guanine nucleotides was best described in terms of interaction at higher and lower affinity states, whereas for other agonists (bromocriptine, DHEC, lisuride, 3 -PPP) a one binding site model was a good description of the data. In the presence of GTP (100 [*]μM) all agonist binding data were best described by a one site model. All of the agonists tested increased [35 S]-GTPγS binding above the basal level and the maximal effects and potencies of the agonists in this test were different. There was no clear relation betwen the ability of an agonist to stabilize the formation of the ternary complex of agonist/receptor/G-protein and the maximal activity of the agonist or the amplification factor (ratio of dissociation constant for binding to receptor to EC 50 in functional assay). A comparison was made between the profiles of the D 2 (short) and D 2 (long) receptor isoforms in these assays...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine {{release in}} the retina {{is subject to}} {{modulation}} via autoreceptors, which belong to the D 2 receptor family (encompassing the D 2, D 3 and D 4 receptors). The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the receptor subtype (D 2 vs D 3) involved in the inhibition of dopamine release in guinea-pig retinal discs, using established (haloperidol, (S) -nafadotride) and novel dopamine receptor antagonists (ST- 148, ST- 198). hD 2 L and hD 3 receptors were expressed in CHO cells and the pKi values determined in binding studies with [125 I]-iodosulpride were: haloperidol 9. 22 vs 8. 54; ST- 148 7. 85 vs 6. 60; (S) -nafadotride 8. 52 vs 9. 51; ST- 198 6. 14 vs 7. 92. The electrically evoked tritium overflow from retinal discs preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline (which represents quasi-physiological dopamine release) was inhibited by the dopamine receptor agonists B-HT 920 (<b>talipexole)</b> and quinpirole (maximally by 82 and 71 %; pEC 50 5. 80 and 5. 83). The concentration-response curves of these agonists were shifted to the right by haloperidol (apparent pA 2 8. 69 and 8. 23) and ST- 148 (7. 52 and 7. 66). (S) -Nafadotride 0. 01 [*]μM and ST- 198 0. 32 [*]μM did not affect the concentration-response curve of B-HT 920. The dopamine autoreceptor in the guinea-pig retina can be classified as a D 2 receptor. ST- 148 and ST- 198 show an improved selectivity for D 2 and D 3 receptors when compared to haloperidol and (S) -nafadotride, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Mouse brain slices preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline or [3 H]-serotonin were superfused with medium {{containing}} naloxone 10 [*]μM; {{we studied}} whether nociceptin (the endogenous ligand at ORL 1 receptors) affects monoamine release. Furthermore, the affinities of ORL 1 ligands were determined using [3 H]-nociceptin binding. The electrically (0. 3 [*]Hz) evoked tritium overflow in mouse cortex slices preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline was inhibited by nociceptin and [Tyr 14]-nociceptin (maximally by 80 %; pEC 50 7. 52 and 8. 28) but {{not affected by}} [des-Phe 1]-nociceptin (pEC 50 < 6). The ORL 1 antagonist naloxone benzoylhydrazone antagonized the effect of nociceptin and [Tyr 14]-nociceptin. The effect of nociceptin did not desensitize, was not affected by blockade of NO synthase, cyclo-oxygenase and P 1 -purinoceptors and was decreased by the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>talipexole.</b> Nociceptin also inhibited the evoked overflow in mouse cerebellar, hippocampal and hypothalamic slices in a manner sensitive to naloxone benzoylhydrazone. The electrically (3 [*]Hz) evoked tritium overflow in mouse cortex slices preincubated with [3 H]-serotonin was inhibited by nociceptin; naloxone benzoylhydrazone antagonized this effect. The affinities (pKi) for [3 H]-nociceptin binding to mouse cortex membranes were: nociceptin, 8. 71; [Tyr 14]-nociceptin, 9. 82; [des-Phe 1]-nociceptin, < 5. 5; naloxone benzoylhydrazone, 5. 85; naloxone, < 4. 5. In conclusion, nociceptin inhibits noradrenaline release in the mouse cortex via ORL 1 receptors, which interact with presynaptic α 2 -autoreceptors on noradrenergic neurones. The effect of nociceptin does not desensitize nor does it involve NO, prostanoids or adenosine. Nociceptin also attenuates noradrenaline release from several subcortical regions and serotonin release from cortical slices by a naloxone benzoylhydrazone-sensitive mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Ligand[*]:[*]receptor {{interactions}} were analysed at wt, mutant Ser 200 Ala and Ser 204 Ala α 2 A ARs by measuring Ca 2 + responses in CHO-K 1 cells either by co-expression with a Gα 15 protein or at a receptor[*]:[*]Gα 15 protein stoichiometry of 1. 0 using fusion proteins. The {{magnitude of the}} UK 14304 -mediated Ca 2 + response as elicited by a Gα 15 protein was largest with both mutant Ser 200 Ala and Ser 204 Ala α 2 AARs compared to the wt α 2 A AR in the co-expression and fusion protein experiments. The activation profiles of the wt and both mutant α 2 A ARs as analysed {{by a series of}} α 2 AR agonists differed. d-Medetomidine and clonidine appeared most efficacious at the Ser 204 Ala α 2 A AR, whereas oxymetazoline was also partially active at the Ser 200 Ala α 2 A AR. <b>Talipexole</b> was silent at both mutant α 2 A ARs. The intrinsic activity of (−) -adrenaline was either absent or partial at the Ser 204 Ala and Ser 200 Ala α 2 A AR, respectively. This latter observation is related to its lower binding affinity for both mutant α 2 A ARs. Ligands characterized as antagonists at wt and Ser 200 Ala α 2 A ARs demonstrated either no intrinsic activity (i. e., RX 811059) or positive efficacy with a different rank order of maximal response at the Ser 204 Ala α 2 A AR (atipamezole=SKF 86466 =idazoxan>dexefaroxan) than Asp 79 Asn α 2 A AR (atipamezole>idazoxan≃SKF 86466 >dexefaroxan) and Thr 373 Lys α 2 A AR (SKF 86466 >atipamezole≃idazoxan>dexefaroxan). These effects were only observed in the co-expression experiments at concentrations in line with their binding affinities. In conclusion, these Ca 2 + data suggest that multiple activation binding sites exist for these ligands at the α 2 A AR, and that their activation may be affected in different ways by the mutations being investigated...|$|E
