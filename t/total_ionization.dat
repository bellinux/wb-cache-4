On the face of it, a simple explanation could be that the valence electrons in an s orbital are more tightly bound and are of lower energy than electrons in p orbitals and therefore less likely to be involved in bonding.

50|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total ion yield and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total ion yield. Among these experiments are those by Chin et al., Augst et al. and Auguste et al. Chin et al. used a 10.6 μm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic which is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the <b>total</b> <b>ionization</b> rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter.|$|E

5000|$|Keldysh modeled the MPI {{process as}} a {{transition}} of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states. In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect {{of the effects of}} Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al. included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which we call PPT model) was derived for short range potential and includes the effect of the long range Coulomb interaction through the first order correction in the quasi-classical action.

The three models studied are the empirical correlation between maximum ionization cross-section and molecular polarizability, the well-known binary encounter Bethe (BEB) model, and the functional group additivity model.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model, {{which is}} free of adjustable or fitted parameters, for calculating electron impact ionization cross sections for atoms and molecules is presented. This model combines the binary-encounter theory with the dipole interaction of the Bethe theory for fast incident electrons. The ratios of the contributions from distant and close collisions and interference between the direct and exchange terms are determined by using the asymptotic behaviors predicted by the Bethe theory for ionization and for stopping cross sections. Our model prescribes procedures to calculate the singly differential cross section (energy distribution) for each subshell using the binding energy, average kinetic energy, and the differential dipole oscillator strengths for that subshell. Then the singly differential cross section is integrated over the ejected electron energy to obtain the <b>total</b> <b>ionization</b> cross section. The resulting <b>total</b> <b>ionization</b> cross section near the threshold {{is proportional to the}} excess energy of the projectile electron. We found that this model yields <b>total</b> <b>ionization</b> cross sections for a variety of atoms and molecules from threshold to several keV which are in good agreement (~ 10 % or better on average) with known experimental results. The energy distributions also exhibit the expected shapes and magnitudes. We offer a simpler version of the model that can be used when differential oscillator strengths are not known.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{constraints}} on soft X-ray emissions from the reionization era. It {{has generally been}} assumed that the Universe was reionized by ultraviolet photons from massive stars. However, {{it has been argued}} that X-ray photons associated with the death of these stars would have contributed ~ 10 % to the <b>total</b> <b>ionizations</b> via several channels. The parameter space for a significant component of cosmological reionization to be sourced by X-rays is limited by a few observations. We revisit the unresolved soft X-ray background constraint and show that it significantly limits the contribution to reionization from several potential sources: X-rays from X-ray binaries, from Compton scattering off supernovae-accelerated electrons, and from the annihilation of dark matter particles. We discuss the additional limits on high-redshift X-ray production from (1) z~ 3 measurements of metal absorption lines, (2) the consensus that helium reionization was ending at z~ 3, and (3) measurements of the intergalactic medium's thermal history. We show that observations of z~ 3 metal lines allow little room for extra coeval X-ray emission from nonstandard sources. In addition, we show that the late reionization of helium makes it difficult to also ionize the hydrogen at z> 6 with a single source population (such as quasars) and that it likely requires the spectrum of ionizing emissions to soften with increasing redshift. However, it is difficult to constrain an X-ray contribution to reionization from the intergalactic temperature history. We show that the gas would have been heated to a narrower range of temperatures than is typically assumed at reionization, 2 - 3 x 10 ^ 4 K. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted to MNRA...|$|R
