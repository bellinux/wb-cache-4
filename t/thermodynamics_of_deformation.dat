40|$|Metallic {{glass or}} {{amorphous}} alloy {{is a new}} class of metallic materials with unique mechanical deformation mechanisms. In the past decade, the encouraging progress has been made on revealing the deformation mechanisms and mechanical behaviors of metallic glasses using various theoretical and computational methods. In this review, the application of the recently developed phase-field method to <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> metallic glasses is emphasized. We first briefly introduce the features <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> metallic glasses, following by a review on the modeling methods that are based on kinetic theory or <b>thermodynamics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deformation</b> defects. Then we focus our attentions on the phase-field modeling which typically treats the localized plastic flow or shear banding as the collective behaviors of structural transformation <b>of</b> the <b>deformation</b> defects. Application <b>of</b> the phase-field modeling to shear banding, local heating, shear band instability in metallic glasses and metallic-glass-matrix composites are discussed. We also highlight the research directions and challenges of phase-field modeling on the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> metallic glasses. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The <b>thermodynamics</b> <b>of</b> {{uniaxial}} solid <b>deformation</b> was studied experimentally for {{a number}} of polymeric solids, including two polyurethane-urea elastomers, natural rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer and low density polyethylene. A deformation calorimeter was developed to measure the heat and work <b>of</b> uniaxial solid <b>deformation</b> and measurements were made on the above materials. A differential scanning calorimetry method was developed to characterize the melting behavior of stretched elastomers which were found to undergo stress-induced crystallization during stretching as deduced from the large but recoverable internal energy changes measured by deformation calorimetry during uniaxial extension and contraction. Wide angle x-ray diffraction and thermostatic measurements were also performed on the elastomers held in the extended state in order to characterize the amorphous-crystalline phase transition which occurs during deformation. ^ The motivation for this work was to evaluate the performance of the two polyurethane-urea elastomers which were found to function effectively as working substances in rubber heat engines. These elastomers could generate 1 Joule of work per gram of elastomer at about 3 % of Carnot efficiency in experimental Sterling cycles. ...|$|R
