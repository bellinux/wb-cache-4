2500|$|First {{revealed}} at the 2011 New York Auto Show, the Taurus {{received a}} refresh for the 2013 model year. The body features a new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED tail lamps, {{as well as}} all-new wheel options. The SHO model features revised styling elements, with unchanged power ratings from its EcoBoost V6. [...] Refinements {{have been made to}} the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, is up to 288hp and gets 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There is a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240hp and 270lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability. For example, <b>Torque</b> <b>Vectoring</b> and curve control has been added as standard, and controls the cars ability to glide around corners at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials have been added, they are now fully digital and clearer and more colourful. MyFord Touch will also be part of Taurus's Sync system.|$|E

Thanks to revised dynamics the facelifted 997 can handle 1.3 g forces on a skid-pad according to Porsche.

40|$|AbstractIn seam bowling, {{the first}} two fingers are {{supposed}} to impart equal amounts of back-spin to the ball. As the rotating arm of the bowler and the backspin of the ball have different senses (clockwise vs. counterclockwise), the spin axis moves rapidly from one hemisphere to the other, thereby crossing the seam, when finger torque is imparted onto the ball. It is shown in this study analytically, that the rapidly precessing spin axis approaches the <b>torque</b> <b>vector,</b> but reaches the <b>torque</b> <b>vector</b> only at large times. From the experimental data, the spin and <b>torque</b> <b>vectors</b> are approximately 10 - 15 ° apart when releasing the ball in seam bowling. If the spin axis is not exactly at the pole of the ball, i. e. perpendicular to the seam, then the seam wobbles by twice the angle between spin and <b>torque</b> <b>vectors.</b> It is therefore advisable to have the finger centre of pressure slightly off seam by 10 - 15 °...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> is a {{technology}} employed in automobile differentials. A differential transfers engine torque to the wheels. <b>Torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> technology provides the differential {{with the ability}} to vary the torque to each wheel. This method of power transfer has recently become popular in all-wheel drive vehicles. [...] Some newer front-wheel drive vehicles also have a basic <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> differential.

The <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> idea builds on the basic principles of a standard differential. A <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> differential performs basic differential tasks while also transmitting torque independently between wheels. This torque transferring ability improves handling and traction in almost any situation. <b>Torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> differentials were originally used in racing.

The data were recorded with a smart cricket ball and a Cortex motion analysis system. The maximal normalised precession {{at the beginning}} of the finger torque increased from topspin to backspin. The reason for this behaviour is that the motion of the bowling arm imparts a topspin on the ball, and therefore the spin axis does not have to change its direction if the fingers impart further topspin on the ball...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn seam bowling, {{the spin}} vector {{precesses}} rapidly into the <b>torque</b> <b>vector,</b> thereby crossing from one hemisphere {{to the other}} once torque is imparted onto the ball. However, the spin axis reaches the <b>torque</b> <b>vector</b> only at large times. If the spin axis does not coincide with the pole of the ball, the seam wobbles and introduces another roughness element. Thus, if the seam is angled toward the smooth side (for half a period per spin revolution) then the flow is turbulent {{on both sides of}} the ball and the aerodynamic side force decreases and vanishes, thereby disturbing the swing. The aim of this study was to investigate how accurate is the placement of the spin axis at release of the ball. A smart cricket ball instrumented with three high-speed MEMS gyroscopes was used for this purpose and the data of four spin bowlers were analysed. It was found that the spin axis can under- and overshoot the optimal position of the ball as well as deviate off the pole. The spin rates recorded were 15 - 20 rps produced by peak torques of 0. 29 - 0. 39 Nm. The deviation of the spin axis correlated with the torque, indicating that too much torque imparted onto the ball worsens the accuracy of bowling. Undershooting the optimal position is due to equal torques imparted by index and middle fingers. The optimal position of the spin axis can be achieved if the middle finger is closer to the seam than the index. This causes an overshooting <b>torque</b> <b>vector</b> and allows the spin axis to be placed at the pole of the ball at release...|$|R

Achieving quantitative {{measurements of the}} spin-transfer-torque vector in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is important for understanding fundamental mechanisms affecting spin-dependent tunneling, and for developing magnetic memories and nanoscale microwave oscillators.

The differential <b>torque</b> <b>vector</b> also rotates out of the plane under bias; we measure a perpendicular component tau_{perp}(V) with bias dependence proportional to V^ 2 for low V, that becomes as large as 30 % of the in-plane torque.
