5|$|In 2003, 25 {{years after}} the incident, former Gov. Romero Barceló {{admitted}} in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> the truth about their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E

So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' It was crazy, because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
500|$|On August 22, 2015, Beholder {{became the}} first filly or mare to win the Grade I Pacific Classic against males. She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. [...] They also suggested that she might race again in 2016 and that upon retirement, Hughes would be likely to keep her at his Spendthrift Farm and not offer her for sale.|$|E
500|$|Master of Puppets {{features}} dynamic {{music and}} thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance {{compared to the}} previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor Ride the Lightning follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on Master of Puppets is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos. According to music writer Joel McIver, Master of Puppets introduced {{a new level of}} heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield's vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control yet aggressive style. The songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted [...] "ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects". The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander. Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, BBC Music's Eamonn Stack stated that [...] "at this stage in their careers Metallica weren't even doing songs, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> stories". The compositions and arrangements benefited from Burton's classical training and understanding of harmony.|$|E

2500|$|Within Catholicism, {{the event}} {{is seen as the}} {{fulfillment}} of a promise by Mary, mother of Jesus to the shepherd children she appeared to several times before 13 October 1917. According to the children's accounts, Mary, referred to as the Lady of Fátima, promised them she would perform a miracle to show people <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>telling</b> the truth, and so caused the crowds to see the sun make [...] "incredible" [...] movements in the sky. Catholics have regarded Mary as a [...] "miracle worker" [...] for centuries, and this view has continued into the 21st century.

40|$|Do people behave {{differently}} when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying {{compared with}} when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> the truth? The combined results of 1, 338 estimates of 158 cues to deception are reported. Results {{show that in}} some ways, liars are less forthcoming than truth tellers, and they tell less compelling tales. They also make a more negative impression and are more tense. Their stories include fewer ordinary imperfections and unusual contents. However, many behaviors showed no discernible links, or only weak links, to deceit. Cues to deception were more pronounced when people were motivated to succeed, especially when the motivations were identity relevant rather than monetary or material. Cues to deception were also stronger when lies were about transgressions. Do people behave in discernibly different ways when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying compared with when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> the truth?
