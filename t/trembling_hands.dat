5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her <b>trembling</b> <b>hands,</b> she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Ali started {{struggling}} with vocal stutters and <b>trembling</b> <b>hands.</b> The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the Mayo Clinic, who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, {{paving the way for}} Ali's return to the ring.|$|E
500|$|On 19 August, {{citizens}} of Moscow gathered around Russia's White House {{and began to}} erect barricades around it, in which at 16:00 Yanayev responded by declaring {{a state of emergency}} in Moscow. Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was [...] "resting". He said: [...] "Over these years he has become very tired and needs some time to get his health back." [...] Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev's weak posture, <b>trembling</b> <b>hands</b> and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing. According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind; Kryuchkov has been described as the [...] "heart and soul of the conspiracy". Yanayev only agreed to head the Emergency Committee on 20August. Along with the other coup leaders, such as Valentin Pavlov and Boris Pugo for instance, Yanayev was dismissed as Vice President and later jailed for his [...] "crimes" [...] against the Soviet state.|$|E
50|$|The {{notions of}} normal-form and extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibria are incomparable, i.e., an {{equilibrium}} of an extensive-form game may be normal-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect but not extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect and vice versa.As {{an extreme example}} of this, Jean-François Mertens has given {{an example of a}} two-player extensive form game where no extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium is admissible, i.e., the sets of extensive-form and normal-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibria for this game are disjoint.|$|R
50|$|An extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect {{equilibrium}} {{is also a}} sequential equilibrium. A normal-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium of {{an extensive}} form game may be sequential but is not necessarily so. In fact, a normal-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium does not {{even have to be}} subgame perfect.|$|R
50|$|Sequential {{equilibrium}} is {{a further}} refinement of subgame perfect equilibrium and evenperfect Bayesian equilibrium. It is itself refined by extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium and proper equilibrium. Strategies of sequential equilibria (or even extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibria) are not necessarilyadmissible. A refinement of sequential equilibrium thatguarantees admissibility is quasi-perfect equilibrium.|$|R
500|$|The glass cage might imply {{a vacuum}} that the figure's voice {{is unable to}} escape; {{as if it is}} {{screaming}} in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon said that he had [...] "wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I think, if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream, it would have made the scream... more successful". The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and [...] "really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things." [...] Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian [...] "shouting voices... and <b>trembling</b> <b>hands...</b> convey the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued by Jean-François Mertens that quasi-perfect {{equilibrium}} is superior to Reinhard Selten's notion of extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium as a quasi-perfect equilibrium is guaranteed to describe admissible behavior. In contrast, for a certain two-player voting game no extensive-form <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium describes admissible behavior for both players.|$|R

5000|$|In game theory, <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect {{equilibrium}} is a {{refinement of}} Nash equilibrium due to Reinhard Selten. A <b>trembling</b> <b>hand</b> perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium {{that takes the}} possibility of off-the-equilibrium play into account by assuming that the players, through a [...] "slip of the hand" [...] or tremble, may choose unintended strategies, albeit with negligible probability.|$|R
