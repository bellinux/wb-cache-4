500|$|In {{the third}} match of the night, [...] "Pegasus Kid" [...] Chris Benoit was the captain on the IWC team which also {{included}} 2 Cold Scorpio and Tito Santana. This was Santana's first PPV appearance {{since leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation. Blue Panther was {{the captain of the}} AAA team, having the task of trying to keep the peace between his partners La Parka and Jerry Estrada, as they had not been getting along in {{the weeks leading up to}} the match. The dissension started early on, as La Parka took offense to Estrada quickly stepping on the apron to let La Parka start the match. To counter, La Parka stepped out on the apron next to Estrada as well, leaving a confused Blue Panther to step back inside the ring while his teammates squabbled on the apron. Later on, as La Parka tried to pin his opponent, Estrada interfered and broke up the pinfall attempt and instead tried to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> for his team. The two took turns throwing each other off their opponent, trying to win the match for their team while a confused Blue Panther looked on. Late in the match, it appeared as though Estrada and La Parka had put their differences aside, as Estrada held Tito Santana outside the ring, motioning for La Parka to dive onto Santana. When La Parka dove out of the ring, Santana moved and La Parka hit Estrada instead, which caused the two partners to fight. Moments later, 2 Cold Scorpio dove off the top rope to the floor, knocking down La Parka, Estrada, and Santana with the move. This left the two captains in the ring fighting it out until Pegasus Kid was able to roll up Blue Panther for the victory. After the match. the IWC team and Blue Panther left the ring while La Parka and Estrada fought each other, with the crowd solidly behind La Parka.|$|E
6000|$|But {{what could}} he do? He had nothing on earth but his sword, so he could not travel to find her. After all, she might not be gone far. Perhaps not gone at all. It might be a mistake, an exaggerated scandal. He would hope so. And yet {{it was evident that}} there had been some {{passages}} between her and Don Guzman. Eustace's mysterious words about the promise at Lundy proved that. The villain! He had felt all along that he was a villain; but just <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a woman's heart, too. Frank had been away--all the Brotherhood away. What a fool he had been, to turn the wolf loose into the sheepfold! And yet who would have dreamed of it? [...] .|$|E

5000|$|When events {{occur to}} us, {{they are much}} more {{personally}} important than when they happen to others. We may be upset or deeply concerned when something bad happens to one of our friends, but when it is us suffering from something the question [...] "why me?"

On {{the other side of the}} coin if something good happens for someone else, like someone winning the lottery, we may say [...] "well that is lucky" [...] and be happy for the person. But if you were <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> it is far more likely to attribute this stroke of luck to [...] "God looking out for you", in other words personal relevance elicits more religious attribution.|$|E
5000|$|The gods {{who listened}} on were cruel-hearted, {{and as a}} prank, {{instructed}} the hare to wash himself in the briny sea, and blow himself dry in the wind. The hare was of course in much more stinging pain than was before. Then came along Ōkuninushi lagging far behind. The gentle-hearted god told the hare {{to go to the}} mouth (of the river) and wash himself in the fresh water, then gather the flowering spikes of cattail plants growing all around, and scatter the catkins on the ground and tumble around until he is covered by fleece. The cured rabbit makes a divined prediction that Ōnamuji will be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> Princess Yakami, [...] "Though thou bearest the bag."

In a wicked-hearted gesture, they advise the rabbit to bathe in the briny sea and blow himself dry in the wind. The rabbit finds himself in worse agony. Ōnamuji, who came lagging behind, takes pity on the creature and tells it to wash himself in fresh water, then roll in the scattered fleece of the cattail plants.
