5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and <b>then</b> <b>will</b> exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, amulets {{are called}} agimat or anting-anting. According to folklore, the most {{powerful}} anting-anting is the hiyas ng saging (directly translated as pearl or gem of the banana). The hiyas must come from a mature banana and only comes out during midnight. Before the person can fully possess this agimat, he must fight a supernatural creature called kapre. Only <b>then</b> <b>will</b> he be its true owner. During Holy Week, devotees travel to Mount Banahaw to recharge their amulets.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} effect {{an escape from}} the {{stricken}} vessel, the escaping crew were required to enter the submarine’s only escape chamber, which can only accommodate one person at a time. As the pressure outside the submarine is greater than the pressure inside, this must be equalised before the outer door of the escape chamber is opened.

25|$|Odin said that, {{given how}} she {{obtained}} it, {{she would never}} get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only <b>then</b> <b>will</b> they stay dead. Freyja agreed.|$|E
25|$|Within 120 days, the Attorney General {{must submit}} to the FISA Court for its {{approval}} the procedures by which the government will determine that acquisitions authorized by the Act conform with the Act and do not involve purely domestic communications.

25|$|Workers pump {{radioactive}} {{water from}} a utility trench near reactor 1 into a storage tank near reactor 4. Water in the condensers for reactors 2 and 3 is shifted to outside storage tanks so that the condensers can remove more contaminated water from inside the reactors. The world's largest concrete pumping truck is shipped from the United States to Fukushima. The truck has been slightly modified {{to be able to}} pump cooling water initially, <b>then</b> <b>will</b> later possibly to be used to pump concrete for any eventual permanent containment structure. A 62-metre-tall pumping truck, donated by Chinese manufacturer SANY is also used.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition. While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees {{need to have a}} voice in their own future; and that voice can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only <b>then</b> <b>will</b> the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} is the real-time tracking and localization {{of one or}} more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which <b>then</b> <b>will</b> be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{reversed}} {{values for}} index of refraction, Veselago predicted {{the occurrence of}} reversed Cherenkov radiation (also known simply as CR) in a left-handed medium. In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov discovered a coherent radiation that occurs when certain types of media are bombarded by fast moving electron beams. In 1937 a theory built around CR stated that when charged particles, such as electrons, travel through a medium at speeds faster {{than the speed of}} light in the medium only <b>then</b> <b>will</b> CR radiate. As the CR occurs, electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a cone shape, fanning out in the forward direction.|$|E
25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only <b>then</b> <b>will</b> she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for a few more weeks before setting out on their own.|$|E
25|$|Duplex {{sequencing}} is {{a library}} preparation and analysis method for next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that employs random tagging of double stranded DNA to detect mutations with higher accuracy and lower error rate. This method uses degenerate molecular tags {{in addition to}} sequencing adapters to recognize reads originating from each strand of DNA. The generated sequencing reads <b>then</b> <b>will</b> be analyzed using two methods: single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) and Duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly. Duplex sequencing theoretically can detect mutations with frequencies as low as 5 x 10−8 {{that is more than}} 10,000 fold higher in accuracy compared to the conventional next-generation sequencing methods.|$|E

25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male <b>then</b> <b>will</b> wrap his tail around her tail, and <b>then</b> <b>will</b> try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods used}} in a typical pirate attack have been analyzed. They show that while attacks can be {{expected}} at any time, most occur during the day; often in the early hours. They may involve two or more skiffs that can reach speeds of up to 25 knots. With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates <b>then</b> <b>will</b> try to get control of the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E
