5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> through his window.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{fortnight}} later, the band, at first subdued, {{broke out in}} a 'wild strain of brazen minstrelsy' during the final bars of the funeral march in the Eroica Symphony. After the movement was applauded {{a member of the}} audience began calling out that a complaint should be lodged, and won general approval, hear, hear, and people standing up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> On one occasion Lady Henschel and her daughter went to hear Joseph Joachim play at a Saturday 'Pop', but were so aware of the 'rhythmic gay sounds, thumping and shimmering away in a most enlivening manner', that they decided to go and hear Moore and Burgess instead.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|The Warriors saw Lin as a {{potential}} backup for Curry. Lacob said the team received more than one trade offer for Lin {{while he was in}} the D-League, but he was happy with Lin's progress as an undrafted free agent. [...] "He's a minimum, inexpensive asset. You need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as a developing asset. Is he going to be a superstar? No." [...] He finished his rookie NBA season averaging 2.6points on 38.9percent shooting in 29games.|$|E
500|$|Popular {{with his}} men, Collins was {{respected}} for {{his faith in}} his team mates {{and his ability to}} relate to different personalities. The Test leg-spinner, Arthur Mailey noted, [...] "I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met." [...] Bert Oldfield said of Collins, [...] "He studied every player's temperament and acted accordingly." [...] Collins was undemonstrative, expecting his fieldsmen <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger. He was last to shower {{at the end of a}} day's play, preferring to sit in a corner in silence. His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day's action and pondering on the next day's possibilities. He was a successful Test captain, leading Australia to five wins and two losses; four matches finished in draws.|$|E

500|$|Lambert's girth {{was then}} enormous; six men of normal size could fit {{together}} inside his waistcoat, {{and each of}} his stockings {{was the size of}} a sack. [...] His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. [...] Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to [...] "tell the gentleman that I am a shy cock". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a Nottingham man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> Lambert told him that the horse in question was [...] "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E
500|$|Boudreau {{discussed}} the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, {{who had also}} played in the Navy with Lemon. [...] "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once I realized {{he was not going}} to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would be worthwhile <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote. Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon [...] "some day will become the best pitcher in the American League." [...] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} Rita Ora and her boyfriend, played by Michael Madsen, {{entering}} a diner. The man steps on and squishes a spider with his boot, just before Iggy Azalea is shown {{as a waitress}} named Fox behind the diner counter. Azalea then approaches the couple and hands them the menu. The man orders a BLT sandwich [...] "dripping with melted cheese" [...] and just when Ora is about to order he interrupts her by saying [...] "she's gonna have the same damn thing", which causes Ora <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> somewhat upset. As Azalea arrives with the order, the man starts complaining about the sandwich and refuses to eat it. Then, {{the owner of the}} diner, Big Wanda, jumps over the counter and asks if there's a problem. After hearing the man's complaint, Azalea tries to explain but to no avail when the owner says [...] "What did the Fox say? Nothing!" [...] and she is told to make another sandwich with more cheese. Ora is shocked when the owner begins to flirt with her boyfriend in front of her, and her boyfriend ignores her because the owner promises him a [...] "big, juicy BLT sandwich" [...] that is the menu's special. When Ora tries to speak up, she is verbally put down by the owner, who says her special order is [...] "nothing like the little sandwich" [...] Ora has. Ora continues to show disapproval towards the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Sufis {{believe the}} sharia (exoteric [...] "canon"), tariqa (esoteric [...] "order") and haqiqa ("truth") are {{mutually}} interdependent. Sufism leads the adept, called salik or [...] "wayfarer", in his sulûk or [...] "road" [...] through different stations (maqaam) until he reaches his goal, the perfect tawhid, the existential confession that God is One. Ibn Arabi says, [...] "When we see someone in this Community {{who claims to}} be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved.

2500|$|Opinions vary as to French's {{military}} abilities. Edward Spears, then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, {{later wrote}} of the former: [...] "You only had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{to see that he}} was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." [...] Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with sweat from riding hard to reach the meeting, was [...] "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was about}} to be {{released}} by WOR in 1956 for not being commercial, he did a commercial for Sweetheart Soap, not a sponsor, and was immediately fired. His listeners besieged WOR with complaints, and when Sweetheart offered to sponsor him he was reinstated. Eventually, he attracted more sponsors than he wanted—the commercials interrupted the flow of his monologues. Ex WOR engineer, Frank Cernese, adds: The commercials of that era were on [...] "ETs"—phonograph records about 14" [...] in diameter. Three large turntables were available to play them in sequence. However, Shepherd liked the engineer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and listen when he told his stories. That left little time to load the turntables and cue the appropriate cuts. That's when he started complaining about [...] "too many commercials". His last WOR broadcast was on April 1, 1977. His subsequent radio work consisted only of short segments on several other stations, including crosstown WCBS, and occasional commentaries on NPR's All Things Considered. His final radio gig was the Sunday night radio show [...] "Shepherd's Pie" [...] on WBAI in the mid-1990s, which consisted of his reading his stories uncut, uninterrupted and unabridged. The show was one of WBAI's most popular of the period. In addition to his stories, his shows also contained, among other things, humorous anecdotes and general commentaries about the human condition, observations about life in New York, accounts of vacations in Maine and travels throughout the world. Among the most striking of his programs was his account of his participation in the March on Washington in August 1963, during which Dr. Martin Luther King gave his [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, and the program that aired on November 25, 1963—the burial day of President John F. Kennedy. However, his most scintillating programs remain his often prophetic, bitingly humorous commentaries about ordinary life in America.|$|E
