5|$|The {{success of}} Woodruff's {{clinical}} transplant program was recognised and enhanced by {{funding from the}} Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield <b>Transplant</b> <b>Surgery</b> Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting {{in the death of}} several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.|$|E

Sara Ramirez appeared in a nine episode arc in the season, portraying orthopedic surgical resident Callie Torres, introduced and developed as a love interest for the character of George O'Malley. Steven W. Bailey is introduced in the recurring role of Joe, the Bartender, often being portrayed as a confidant of the surgeons of Seattle Grace Hospital.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{data file}} of heart <b>transplant</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{performed in the}} United States over a two-year period.

Each concern motivates the construction of alternative models and Bayes factors are used to compare the existing model with the alternative models. Graphical displays are used to check the sensitivity of the posterior analysis with respect to model perturbations and plots of Bayes factors are used to criticize these perturbations. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Heart transplant mortality data Christiansen and Morris (1995) (henceforth referred to as CM) analyze a data file of all heart <b>transplant</b> <b>surgeries</b> pe [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Madarosis has {{different}} possible treatments {{and can be}} reversed if treated early enough. The treatments for madarosis are completely dependent upon the pre-existing condition. When suffering from blepheritis, antibiotics are used to combat the bacterial infection. People who are suffering from trichotillomania need to seek behavioral and psychological help.

25|$|Corneal <b>transplant</b> <b>surgery</b> may be {{difficult}} due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts. Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for patients that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: wedge resection, lamellar crescentic resection, penetrating keratoplasty, lamellar keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating keratoplasty) may be performed if there is enough normal tissue present. However, {{if there is not}} enough normal tissue present, then attaching the graft is difficult.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{an ancient}} medical {{specialty}} that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, <b>transplant</b> <b>surgery,</b> trauma surgery, urology, vascular surgery, and pediatric surgery. In some centers, anesthesiology {{is part of the}} division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.|$|E
25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient. <b>Transplant</b> <b>surgery</b> is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.|$|E
40|$|Importance: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) complicates 2 - 5 % of surgeries in the United States. Severity of SSI {{ranges from}} superficial skin infection to life-threatening {{conditions such as}} severe sepsis, and SSIs are responsible for increased morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with surgery. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a commonly-isolated organism for SSI, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus SSI incidence is increasing globally. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to characterize risk factors for SSI within observational studies describing incidence of SSI in a real-world setting. Evidence Review: An initial search identified 328 titles published in 2002 - 2012; 57 were identified as relevant for data extraction. Extracted information included study design and methodology, reported cumulative incidence and post-surgical time until onset of SSI, and odds ratios and associated variability for all factors considered in univariate and/or multivariable analyses. Findings: Median SSI incidence was 3. 7 %, ranging from 0. 1 % to 50. 4 %. Incidence of overall SSI and S. aureus SSI were both highest in tumor-related and <b>transplant</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Median time until SSI onset was 17. 0 days, with longer time-to-onset for orthopedic and <b>transplant</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Risk factors consistently identified as associated with SSI included co-morbidities, advanced age, risk indices, patient frailty, and surgery complexity.
