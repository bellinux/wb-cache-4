5|$|Courtier and {{journalist}} Dermot Morrah alleged {{that there was}} brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been suggested {{on the grounds that}} Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.|$|E
5|$|Mahmud (Rd. Mochtar), a fisherman, is in {{love with}} Wagini (Soekarsih), a farmer's daughter.

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|In spring 587, Philippicus {{was again}} ill, {{and unable to}} {{campaign}} in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius the Elder and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, {{and sent them to}} raid Persian territory. Heraclius the Elder besieged an unnamed strong fort, using his siege engines day and night until it fell. After installing a garrison in the captured fort, Theophanes the Confessor reports that Heraclius the Elder proceeded to join General Theodore at the siege of Beioudaes, but <b>this</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be an error. Theophanes seems to have misunderstood the relevant passage of Theophylact which has Theodore and Andreas joining at that siege.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{apparently}} {{controlled the}} Kingdom of Lindsey, given {{the evidence of}} a story told by Bede regarding the moving of Oswald's bones to a monastery there; Bede says that the monks rejected the bones initially because Oswald had ruled over them as a foreign king. To the north, {{it may have been}} Oswald who conquered the Gododdin. Irish annals record the siege of Edinburgh, thought to have been the royal stronghold of the Gododdin, in 638, and <b>this</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> mark the end of the kingdom; that this siege was undertaken by Oswald is suggested by the apparent control of the area by his brother Oswiu in the 650s.|$|E
5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, <b>this</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been {{the exception rather than the}} rule.|$|E

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} details are unknown, in April738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{captured}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup {{does not seem}} to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. All of <b>this</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E

5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be the case at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting {{that took place in the}} city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but <b>this</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ises olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. <b>This</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E
